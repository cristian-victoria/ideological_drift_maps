Democratic Party,1972,1970,dem_1972.csv,CSV,"New Directions: '72-'76 Skepticism and cynicism are widespread in America. The people are skeptical of platforms filled with political platitudes - of promises made by opportunistic politicians. The people are cynical about the idea that a rosy future is just around the corner. And is it any wonder that the people are skeptical and cynical of the whole political process? Our traditions. our history, our Constitution, our laws, all say that America belongs to its people. But the people no longer believe it. They feel that the government is run for the privileged few rather than for the many - and they are right. No political party, no President, no government can by itself restore a lost sense of faith. No Administration can provide solutions to all our problems. What we can do is to recognize the doubts of Americans, to speak to those doubts, and to act to begin turning those doubts into hopes. As Democrats, we know that we share responsibility for that loss of confidence. But we also know, as Democrats, that at decisive moments of choice in our past, our party has offered leadership that has tapped the best within our country. Our party - standing by its ideals of domestic progress and enlightened internationalism - has served America well. We have nominated or elected men of the high calibre of Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman. Adlai E. Stevenson, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Lyndon Baines Johnson - and in the last election Hubert Humphrey and Edmund S. Muskie. In that proud tradition we are now prepared to move forward. We know that our nation cannot tolerate any longer a government that shows no regard for the people's basic needs and no respect for our right to the truth from those who lead us. What do the people want? They want three things:  They want a personal life that makes us all feel that life is worth living. They want a social environment whose institutions promote the good of all, and They want a physical environment whose resources are used for the good of all. They want an opportunity to achieve their aspirations and their dreams for themselves and their children. We believe in the rights of citizens to achieve to the limit of their talents and energies. We are determined to remove barriers that limit citizens because they are black, brown, young or women, because they never had the chance to gain an education; because there was no possibility of being anything but what they were. We believe in hard work as a fair measure of our own willingness to achieve. We are determined that millions should not stand idle while work demands to be done. We are determined that the dole should not become a permanent way of life for any. And we are determined that government no longer tax the product of hard work more rigorously than it taxes inherited wealth, or money that is gained simply by having money in the first place. We believe that the law must apply equally to all, and that it must be an instrument of justice. We are determined that the citizen must be protected in his home and on his streets. We are determined also that the ordinary citizen should not be imprisoned for a crime before we know whether he is guilty or not while those with the right friends and the right connections can break the law without ever facing the consequences of their actions. We believe that war is a waste of human life. We are determined to end forthwith a war which has cost 50,000 American lives, $150 billion of our resources, that has divided us from each other, drained our national will and inflicted incalculable damage to countless people. We will end that war by a simple plan that need not be kept secret: The immediate total withdrawal of all Americans from Southeast Asia. We believe in the right of an individual to speak, think, read, write, worship, and live free of official intrusion. We are determined that our government must no longer tap the phones of law-abiding citizens nor spy on those who have broken no law. We are determined that never again shall government seek to censor the newspapers and television. We are determined that the government shall no longer mock the supreme law of the land, while it stands helpless in the face of crime which makes our neighborhoods and communities less and less safe. Perhaps most fundamentally, we believe that government is the servant, not the master, of the people. We are determined that government should not mean a force so huge, so impersonal that the complaint of an ordinary citizen goes unheard. That is not the kind of government America was created to build. Our ancestors did not fight a revolution and sacrifice their lives against tyrants from abroad to leave us a government that does not know how to listen to its own people. The Democratic Party is proud of its past; hut we are honest enough to admit that we are part of the past and share in its mistakes. We want in 1972 to begin the long and difficult task of reviewing existing programs, revising them to make them work and finding new techniques to serve the public need. We want to speak for, and with, the citizens of our country. Our pledge is to be truthful to the people and to ourselves, to tell you when we succeed, but also when we fail or when we are not sure. In 1976, when this nation celebrates its 200th anniversary, we want to tell you simply that we have done our best to give the government to those who formed it - the people of America. Every election is a choice: In 1972, Americans must whether they want their country back again. II. Jobs, Prices and Taxes ""I went to school here and I had some training for truck driver school and I go to different places and put in applications for truck driving but they say, 'We can't hire you without the experience.' Now, I don't have the experience. I can't get the experience without the job first. I have four kids, you know, and I'm on unemployment. And when my employment runs out, I'll probably be on relief, like a lot of other people. But, being that I have so many kids, relief is just not going to be enough money. I'm looking for maybe the next year or too, if I don't get a job they'll probably find me down at the county jail, because I have to do something."" - Robert Coleman, Pittsburgh Hearing, June 2, 1972 The Nixon Administration has deliberately driven people out of work in a heartless and ineffective effort to deal with inflation. Ending the Nixon policy of creating unemployment is the first task of the Democratic Party.  The Nixon ""game plan"" called for more unemployment. Tens of millions of families have suffered joblessness or cutbacks in the last four years in the name of fighting inflation ... and for nothing. Prices rose faster in early 1972 than at any time from 1960 to 1968. Today there are 5.5 million unemployed. The nations have suffered $175 billion in lost production during the Nixon Administration by election day. Twenty percent of our people have suffered a period without a job each year in the last three. Business has lost more in profits than it has gained from his Administration s business-oriented tax cuts. In pockets of cities, up to 40 percent of our young people are jobless. Farmers have seen the lowest parity ratios since the Great Depression. For the first time in :30 years, there is substantial unemployment among aerospace technicians, teachers and other white collar workers. The economic projections have been manipulated for public relations purposes. The current Nixon game plan includes a control structure which keeps workers wages down while executive salaries soar, discourages productivity and distributes income away from those who need it and has produced no significant dent in inflation, as prices for food, clothes, rent and basic necessities soar. These losses were unnecessary. They are the price of a Republican Administration which has no consistent economic philosophy, no adequate regard for the human costs of its economic decisions and no vision of what a full employment economy could mean for all Americans. Jobs, Income and Dignity. Full employment - a guaranteed job for all - is the primary economic objective of the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party is committed to a job for every American who seeks work. Only through full employment can we reduce the burden on working people. We are determined to make economic security a matter of right. This means a job with decent pay and good working conditions for everyone willing and able to work and an adequate income for those unable to stork. It means abolition of the present welfare system. To assure jobs and economic security far all, the next Democratic Administration should support:  A full employment economy, making full use of fiscal and monetary policy to stimulate employment. Tax reform directed toward equitable distribution of income and wealth and fair sharing of the cost of government. Full enforcement of all equal employment opportunity laws, including federal contract compliance and federally regulated industries and giving the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission adequate staff and resources and power to issue cease and desist orders promptly. Vastly increased efforts to open education at all levels and in all fields to minorities, women and other under-represented groups. An effective nationwide job placement system to enhance worker mobility. Opposition to arbitrarily high standards for entry to jobs. Overhaul of current manpower programs to assure training - without sex, race or language discrimination - for jobs that really exist with continuous skill improvement and the chance for advancement. Economic development programs to ensure the growth of communities and industry in lagging parts of the nation and the economy. Use of federal depository funds to reward banks and other financial institutions which invest in socially productive endeavors. Improved adjustment assistance and job creation for workers and employers hurt by foreign competition, reconversion of defense-oriented companies, rapid technological change and environmental protection activities. Closing tax loopholes that encourage the export of American jobs by American controlled multinational corporations. Assurance that the needs of society are considered when a decision to close or move an industrial plant is to be made and that income loss to workers and revenue loss to communities does net occur when plants are closed. Assurance that, whatever else is done in the income security area, the social security system provides a decent income for the elderly, the blind and the disabled and their dependents, with escalators so that benefits keep pace with rising prices and living standards. Reform of social security and government employment security programs to remove all forms of discrimination by sex, and Adequate federal income assistance for those who do not benefit sufficiently from the above measures. The last is not least, but it is last for good reason. The present welfare system has failed because it has been required to make up for too many other failures. Millions of Americans are forced into public assistance because public policy too often creates no other choice. The heart of a program of economic security based on earned income must be creating jobs and training people to fill them. Millions of jobs - real jobs, not make-work - need to be provided. Public service employment must be greatly expanded in order to make the government the employer of last resort and guarantee a job for all. Large sections of our cities resemble bombed-out Europe alter World War II. Children in Appalachia cannot go to school when the dirt road is a sea of mud. Homes, schools and clinics, roads and mass transit systems need to be built. Cleaning up our air and water will take skills and people in large numbers. In the school, the police department, the welfare agency or the recreation program, there are new careers to be developed to help ensure that social services reach the people for whom they are intended. It may cost more, at least initially, to create decent jobs than to perpetuate the hand-out system of present welfare. But the return - in new public facilities and services, in the dignity of bringing a paycheck home and in the taxes that will come back in - far outweigh the cost of the investment. The next Democratic Administration must end the present welfare system and replace it with an income security program which places cash assistance in an appropriate context with all of the measures outlined above, adding up to an earned income approach to ensure each family an income substantially more than the poverty level ensuring standards of decency and health, as officially defined in the area. Federal income assistance will supplement the income of working poor people and assure an adequate income for those unable to work. With full employment and simpler, fair administration, total costs will go down, and with federal financing the burden on local and state budgets will be eased. The program will protect current benefit goals during the transitional period. The system of income protection which replaces welfare must be a part of the full employment policy which assures every American a job at a fair wage under conditions which make use of his ability and provide an opportunity for advancement. HR 1, and its various amendments, is not humane and does not meet the social and economic objectives that we believe in, and it should be defeated. It perpetuates the coercion of forced work requirements. Economic Management. Every American family knows how its grocery bill has gone up under Nixon. Every American family has felt the bite of higher and higher prices for food and housing and clothing. The Administration attempts to stop price rises have been dismal failures - for which the working people have paid in lost jobs, missed raises and higher prices. This nation achieved its economic greatness under a system of free enterprise, coupled with human effort and ingenuity, and thus it must remain. This will be the attitude and objective of the Party. There must be an end to inflation and the ever-increasing cost of living. This is of vital concern to the laborer, the housewife, the farmer and the small businessman, as well as the millions of Americans dependent upon their weekly or monthly income for sustenance. It wrecks the retirement plans and lives of our elderly who must survive on pensions or savings gauged by the standards of another day. Through greater efficiency in the operation of the machinery of government, so badly plagued with duplication, overlapping and excesses in programs, we will ensure that bureaucracy will cease to exist solely for bureaucracy's own sake. The institutions and functions of government will be judged by their efficiency of operation and their contribution to the lives and welfare of our citizens. A first priority of a Democratic Administration must he eliminating the unfair, bureaucratic Nixon wage and price controls. When price rises threaten to or do get out of control - as they are now - strong, fair action must he taken to protect family income and savings. The theme of that action should he swift, tough measures to break the wage-price spiral and restore the economy. In that kind of economic emergency America's working people will support a truly fair stabilization program which affects profits, investment earnings, executive salaries and prices, as well as wages. The Nixon controls do not meet that standard. They have forced the American worker, who suffers most from inflation, to pay the price of trying to end it. In addition to stabilizing the economy we propose:  To develop automatic instruments protecting the livelihood of Americans who depend on fixed incomes, such as savings bonds with purchasing power guarantees and cost-of-living escalators in government social security and income support payments. To create a system of ""recession insurance"" for states and localities to replace lost local revenues with federal funds in economic downturns, thereby avoiding reduction in public employment or public services. To establish longer-term budget and fiscal planning, and To create new mechanisms to stop unwarranted price increases in concentrated industries. Toward Economic Justice. The Democratic Party deplores the increasing concentration of economic power in fewer and fewer hands. Five percent of the American people control 90 percent of our productive national wealth. Less than one percent of all manufacturers have 88 percent of the profits. Less than two percent of the population now owns approximately 80 percent of the nation's personally-held corporate stock. 90 percent of the personally-held corporate bonds and nearly 100 percent of the personally-held municipal bonds. The rest of the population - including all working men and women - pay too much for essential products and services because of national policy and market distortions. The Democratic Administration should pledge itself to combat factors which tend to concentrate wealth and stimulate higher prices. To this end, the federal government should:  Develop programs to spread economic growth among the workers, farmers and small businessmen. Help make parts of the economy more efficient - such as medical care - where wasteful and inefficient practices now increase prices. Step up anti-trust action to help competition, with particular regard to laws and enforcement curbing conglomerate mergers which swallow up efficient small business and feed the power of corporate giants. Strengthen the anti-trust laws so that the divestiture remedy will he used vigorously to break up large conglomerates found to violate the anti-trust laws. Abolish the oil import quota that raises prices for consumers. Deconcentrate shared monopolies such as auto, steel and tire industries which administer prices, create unemployment through restricted output and stifle technological innovation. Assure the right of the citizen to recover costs and attorney fees in all successful suits including class actions involving constitutionally guaranteed rights. or rights secured by federal statutes. Adjust rate-making and regulatory activities, with particular attention to regulations which increase prices for food, transportation and other necessities. Remove artificial constraints in the job market by better job manpower training and strictly enforcing equal employment opportunity. Stiffen the civil and criminal statutes to make corporate officers responsible for their actions, and Establish a temporary national economic commission to study federal chartering of large multinational and international corporations, concentrated ownership and control in the nation's economy. Tax Reform. The last ten years hare seen a massive shift in the tax burden from the rich to the working people of America. This is due to cuts in federal income taxes simultaneous with big increases in taxes which bear heavily on lower incomes - state and local sales and property taxes and the payroll tax. These federal tax system is also still grossly unfair and over-complicated. The wealthy and corporations get special tax favors; some require major reform of the nation's tax structure - to achieve a more equitable distribution of income and to raise the funds needs by government. The American people neither should nor will accept anything less from the next Administration. The Nixon Administration, which fought serious reform in 1969, has no program, only promises, for tax reform. Its clumsy administrative favoring of the well-off has meant quick action on corporate tax giveaways like accelerated depreciation, while over-withholding from workers' paychecks goes on and on while the Administration tries to decide what to do. In recent years, the federal tax system has moved precipitously in the wrong direction. Corporate taxes have dropped from 30 percent of federal revenues in 1954 to 16 percent in 1973, but payroll taxes for Social Security - regressive because the burden falls more heavily on the worker than on the wealthy have gone from 10 percent to 29 percent over the same period. If legislation now pending in Congress passes, payroll taxes will have increased over 500 percent between 1960 and 1977 - from $144 to $755 - for the average wage earner. Most people earning under $10,000 now pay more in regressive payroll tax than in income tax. Now the Nixon Administration - which gave corporation the largest tax cut in American history - is considering a hidden national sales tax (Value Added tax) which would further shift the burden to the average wage earner and raise prices of virtually everything ordinary people buy. It is cruel and unnecessary to pretend to relieve one bad tax, the property tax, by a new tax which is just as bad. We oppose this price-raising unfair tax in any form. Federal Income Tax. The Democratic Party believes that all unfair corporate and individual tax preferences should be removed The tax law is clogged with complicated provisions and special interests, such as percentage oil depletion and other favors for the oil industry, special rates and rules for capital gains, fast depreciation unrelated to useful life, easy-to-abuse ""expense-account"" deductions and the ineffective minimum tax. These hidden expenditures in the federal budget are nothing more than billions of ""tax welfare"" aid for the wealthy, the privileged and the corporations. We, therefore, endorse as a minimum step the Mills-Mansfield Tax Policy Review Act of 1972, which would repeal virtual all tax preferences in the existing law over the period 1974 - 1976, as a means of compelling a systematic review of their value to the nation. We acknowledge that the original reasons for some of these tax preferences may remain valid, but believe that none should escape close scrutiny and full public exposure. The most unjustified one of the tax loopholes should, however, be closed immediately, without waiting for a review of the whole system. After the implementation of the minimum provisions of the Mills-Mansfield Act, the Democratic Party, to combat the economically-depressing effect of a regressive income tax scheme, proposes further revision of the tax law to ensure economy equality of opportunity to ordinary Americans. We hold that the federal tax structure should reflect following principles:  The cost of government must be distributed more fairly among income classes. We reaffirm the long-established principle of progressive taxation - allocating the burden according to ability to pay - which is all but a dead letter in the presently code. The cost of government must be distributed fairly among citizens in similar economic circumstances. Direct expenditures by the federal government which can be budgeted are better than tax preferences as the means for achieving public objectives. The lost income of those tax preferences which are deemed desirable should be stated in the annual budget. When relief for hardship is provided through federal tax policy, as for blindness, old age or poverty, benefits should be provided equally by credit rather than deductions which favor recipients with more income, with special provisions for those whose credits would exceed the tax they owe. Provisions which discriminate against working women and single people should be corrected. In addition to greater fairness and efficiency these principles would mean a major redistribution of personal tax burdens and permit considerable simplification of the tax code and tax forms. Social Security Tax. The Democratic Party commits itself to make the Social Security tax progressive by raising substantially the ceiling on earned income. To permit needed increases in Social Security benefits, we will use general revenues as necessary to supplement payroll tax receipts. In this way, we will support continued movement toward general revenue financing for social security. Property Tax. Greater fairness in taxation at the federal level will have little meaning for the vast majority of American households if the burden of inequitable local taxation is not reduced. To reduce the local property tax for all American families, we support equalization of school spending and substantial increases in the federal share of education costs and general revenue sharing. New terms of federal financial assistance to states and localities should be made contingent upon property tax reforms, including equal treatment and full publication of assessment ratios. Tax policy should not provide incentives that encourage over-investment in developed countries by American business, and mechanisms should be instituted to limit undesirable capital exports that exploit labor abroad and damage the American worker at home. Labor-Management Relations. Free private collective bargaining between management and independent labor unions has been, and must remain, the cornerstone of our free enterprise system. America achieved its greatness through the combined energy and efforts of the working men and women of this country. Retention of its greatness rests in their hands. Through their great trade union organizations, these men and women have exerted tremendous influence on the economic and social life of the nation and have attained a standard of living known to no other nation. The concern of the Party is that the gains which labor struggled so long to obtain not be lost to them, whether through inaction or subservience to illogical Republican domestic policies. We pledge continued support for our system of free collective bargaining and denounce any attempt to substitute compulsory arbitration for it. We, therefore, oppose the Nixon Administration's effort to impose arbitration in transportation disputes through its last-offer-selection bill. The National Labor Relations Act should be updated to ensure:  Extension of protection to employees of non-profit institutions. Remedies which adequately reflect the losses caused by violations of the Act. Repeal of section 14(b), which allows states to legislate the open shop and remove the ban on common-sites picketing, and Effective opportunities for unions, as well as employers, to communicate with employees, without coercion by either side or by anyone acting on their behalf. The Railway Labor Act should be updated to ensure:  That strikes on a single carrier or group of carriers cannot be transformed into nation-wide strikes or lockouts. Incentives for bargaining which would enable both management and labor to resolve their differences without referring to government intervention, and Partial operation of struck railroads to ensure continued movement of essential commodities. New legislation is needed to ensure:  Collective bargaining rights for government employees. Universal coverage and longer duration of the Unemployment Insurance and Workmen's Compensation programs and to establish minimum federal standards, including the establishment of equitable wage-loss ratios in those programs, including a built-in escalator clause that fairly reflects increases in average wage rates, and That workers covered under private pension plans actually receive the personal and other fringe benefits to which their services for their employer entitle them. This requires that the fixed right to benefits starts early in employment, that reserves move with the worker from job to job and that re-insurance protection be given pension plans. Labor Standards. American workers are entitled to job safety at a living wage. Most of the basic protections needed have been recognized in legislation already enacted by Congress. The Fair Labor Standards Act should be updated, however, to:  Move to a minimum wage of $2.50 per hour, which allows a wage earner to earn more than a poverty level income for 40 hours a week, with no subminimums for special groups or age differentials. Expand coverage to include the 16 million workers not presently covered, including domestic workers, service workers, agricultural employees and employees of governmental and nonprofit agencies, and Set overtime premiums which give an incentive to hire new employees rather than to use regular employees for extended periods of overtime. The Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act should be updated to provide adequate protection for injured workers and federal standards for workmen's compensation should be set by Congress. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 should be extended to be fully effective, and to cover professional, executive and administrative workers. Maternity benefits should be made available to all working women. Temporary disability benefits should cover pregnancy, childbirth, miscarriage and recovery. Occupational Health and Safety. Each year over 14,000 American workers are killed on their jobs, and nine million injured. Unknown millions more are exposed to long-term danger and disease from exposure to dangerous substances. Federal and state laws are supposed to protect workers; but these laws are not being enforced. This Administration has hired only a handful of inspectors and proposes to turn enforcement over to the same state bureaucracies that have proven inadequate in the past. Where violations are detected, only token penalties have been assessed. We pledge to fully and rigorously enforce the laws which protect the safety and health of workers on their jobs and to extend those laws to all jobs, regardless of number of employees. This must include standards that truly protect against all health hazards, adequate federal enforcement machinery backed up by rigorous penalties and an opportunity for workers themselves to participate in the laws' enforcement by sharing responsibility for plant inspection. We endorse federal research and development of effective approaches to combat the dehumanizing and debilitating effects of monotonous work. Farm Labor. The Sixties and Seventies have seen the struggle for unionization by the poorest of the poor in our country - America's migrant farm workers. Under the leadership of Cesar Chavez, the United Farm Workers have accomplished in the non-violent tradition what was thought impossible only a short time ago. Through hard work and much sacrifice, they are the one group that is successfully organizing farm workers. Their movement has caught the imagination of millions of Americans who have not eaten grapes so that agribusiness employers will recognize their workers as equals and sit down with them in meaningful collective bargaining. We now call upon all friends and supporters of this movement to refrain from buying or eating non-union lettuce. Furthermore, we support the farm workers' movement and the use of boycotts as a non-violent and potent weapon for gaining collective bargaining recognition and contracts for agricultural workers. We oppose the Nixon Administration's effort to enjoin the use of the boycott. We also affirm the right of farm workers to organize free of repressive anti-labor legislation, both state and federal. III. Rights, Power and Social Justice ""We're just asking, and we don't ask for much. Just to give us the opportunity to live as human beings as other people have lived."" - Dorothy Bolden, Atlanta Hearing, June 9, 1972 ""All your platform has to say is that the rights, opportunities and political power of citizenship will be extended to the lowest level, to neighborhoods and individuals. If your party can live up to that simple pledge, my faith will be restored."" - Bobby Westbrooks, St. Louis Hearing, June 17, 1972 ""We therefore urge the Democratic Party to adopt the principle that America has a responsibility to offer every American family the best in health care, whenever they need it, regardless of income or any other factor. We must devise a system which will assure that ... every American receives comprehensive health services from the day he is born until the day he dies, with an emphasis on preventive care to keep him healthy .... "" - Senator Edward M. Kennedy, St. Louis Hearing, June 17, 1972 The Democratic Party commits itself to be responsive to the millions of hard working, lower- and middle-income Americans who are traditionally courted by politicians at election time, get bilked at tax-paying time, and are too often forgotten the balance of the time. This is an era of great change. The world is fast moving into a future for which the past has not prepared us well; a future where to survive, to find answers to the problems which threaten us as a people. we must create qualitatively new solutions. We can no longer rely on old systems of thought, the results of which were partially successful programs that were heralded as important social reforms in the past. It is time now to rethink and reorder the institutions of this country so that everyone - women, blacks, Spanish-speaking, Puerto Ricans, Indians, the young and the old - can participate in the decision-making process inherent in the democratic heritage to which we aspire. We must restructure the social, political and economic relationships throughout the entire society in order to ensure the equitable distribution of wealth and power. The Democratic Party in 1972 is committed to resuming the march toward equality; to enforcing the laws supporting court decisions and enacting new legal rights as necessary, to assuring every American true opportunity, to bringing about a more equal distribution of power, income and wealth and equal and uniform enforcement in all states and territories of civil rights statutes and acts. In the 1970's, this commitment requires the fulfillment - through laws and policies, through appropriations and directives, through leadership and exhortation - of a wide variety of rights:  The right to full participation in government and the political process. The rights of free speech and free political expression, of freedom from official intimidation, harassment and invasion of privacy, as guaranteed by the letter and the spirit of the constitution. The right to a decent job and an adequate income with dignity. The right to quality, accessibility and sufficient quantity of tax-supported services and amenities - including educational opportunity, health care, housing and transportation. The right to quality, safety and the lowest possible cost on goods and services purchased in the market place. The right to be different, to maintain a cultural or ethnic heritage of lifestyle, without being forced into a compelled homogeneity. The rights of people who lack rights: Children, the mentally retarded, mentally ill and prisoners, to name some, and The right to legal services, both civil and criminal, necessary to enforce secured rights. Free Expression and Privacy. The new Democratic Administration should bring an end to the pattern of political persecution and investigation, the use of high office as a pulpit for unfair attack and intimidation and the blatant efforts to control the poor and to keep them from acquiring additional economic security or political power. The epidemic of wiretapping and electronic surveillance engaged in by the Nixon Administration and the use of grand juries for purposes of political intimidation must be ended. The rule of law and the supremacy of the Constitution, as these concepts have traditionally been understood, must be restored. We strongly object to secret computer data banks on individuals. Citizens should have access to their own files that are maintained by private commercial firms and the right to insert corrective material. Except in limited cases, the same should apply to government files. Collection and maintenance by federal agencies of dossiers on law-abiding citizens, because of their political views and statements, must be stopped, and files which never should have been opened should be destroyed. We firmly reject the idea of a National Computer Data Bank. The Nixon policy of intimidation of the media and Administration efforts to use government power to block access to media by dissenters must end, if free speech is to be preserved. A Democratic Administration must be an open one, with the fullest possible disclosure of information, with an end to abuses of security classifications and executive privilege, and with a regular top-level press conferences. The Right To Be Different. The new Democratic Administration can help lead America to celebrate the magnificence of the diversity within its population, the racial, national, linguistic and religious groups which have contributed so much to the vitality and richness of our national life. As thinks are, official policy too often forces people into a mold of artificial homogeneity. Recognition and support of the cultural identity and pride of black people are generations overdue. The American Indians, the Spanish-speaking, the Asian Americans - the cultural and linguistic heritage of these groups is too often ignored in schools and communities. So, too, are the backgrounds, traditions and contributions of white national, ethnic, religious and regional communities ignored. All official discrimination on the basis of sex, age, race, language, political belief, religion, region or national origin must end. No American should be subject to discrimination in employment or restriction in business because of ethnic background or religious practice. Americans should be free to make their own choice of lifestyles and private habits without being subject to discrimination or prosecution. We believe official policy can encourage diversity while continuing to place full emphasis on equal opportunity and integration. We urge full funding of the Ethnic Studies bill to provide funds for development of curriculum to preserve America's ethnic mosaic. Rights of Children. One measure of a nation's greatness is the care it manifests for all of its children. The Nixon Administration has demonstrated a callous attitude toward children repeatedly through veto and administrative decisions. We, therefore, call for a reordering of priorities at all levels of American society so that children, our most precious resource, and families come first. To that end, we call for:  The federal government to fund comprehensive developmental child care programs that will be family centered, locally controlled and universally available. These programs should provide for active participation of all family members in the development and implementation of the program. Health, social service and early childhood education should he part of these programs, as well as a variety of options most appropriate to their needs. Child care is a supplement not a substitute, for the family. The establishment of a strong child advocacy program, financed by the federal government and other sources, with full ethnic, cultural, racial and sexual representation First priority for the needs of children, as we move toward a National Health Insurance Program. The first step should be immediate implementation of the federal law passed in the 1967 Social Security Amendments providing for ""early and periodic screening, diagnosis and treatment"" of children's health problems. Legislation and administrative decisions to drastically reduce childhood injuries - prenatal, traffic, poisoning, burns, malnutrition, rat bites and to provide health and safety education. Full funding of legislation designed to meet the needs of children with special needs: The retarded, the physically and mentally handicapped, and those whose environment produces abuse and neglect and directs the child to anti-social conduct. Reaffirmation of the rights of bilingual, handicapped or slow-learning children to education in the public schools, instead of being wrongly classified as retarded or uneducable and dismissed. Revision of the juvenile court system; dependency and neglect cases must be removed from the corrections system, and clear distinctions must he drawn between petty childhood offenses and the more serious crimes. Allocation of funds to the states to provide counsel to children in juvenile proceedings, legal or administrative, and Creation by Congress of permanent standing committees on Children and Youth.  Rights of Women. Women historically have been denied a full voice in the evolution of the political and social institutions of this country and are therefore allied with all underrepresented groups in a common desire to form a more humane and compassionate society. The Democratic Party pledges the following:  A priority effort to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. Elimination of discrimination against women in public accommodations and public facilities, public education and in all federally-assisted programs and federally-contracted employment. Extension of the jurisdiction of the Civil Rights Commission to include denial of civil rights on the basis of sex Full enforcement of all federal statutes and executive laws barring job discrimination on the basis of sex, giving the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission adequate staff and resources and power to issue cease-and-desist orders promptly. Elimination of discriminatory features of criminal laws and administration. Increased efforts to open educational opportunities at all levels, eliminating discrimination against women in access to education, tenure, promotion and salary. Guarantee that all training programs are made more equitable, both in terms of the numbers of women involved and the job opportunities provided; jobs must be available on the basis of skill, not sex. Availability of maternity benefits to all working women; temporary disability benefits should cover pregnancy, childbirth miscarriage and recovery. Elimination of all tax inequities that affect women and children, such as higher taxes for single women. Amendment of the Social Security Act to provide equitable retirement benefits for families with working wives, widows women heads of households and their children. Amendment of the Internal Revenue Code to permit working families to deduct from gross income as a business expense, housekeeping and child care costs. Equality for women on credit, mortgage, insurance, property, rental and finance contracts. Extension of the Equal Pay Act to all workers, with amendment to read ""equal pay for comparable work."" Appointment of women to positions of top responsibility in all branches of the federal government to achieve an equitable ratio of women and men. Such positions include Cabinet members, agency and division heads and Supreme Court Justices; inclusion of women advisors in equitable ratios on all government studies, commissions and hearings, and Laws authorizing federal grants on a matching basis for financing State Commissions of the Status of Women. Rights of Youth. In order to ensure, maintain and secure the proper role and functions of youth in American government, politics and society, the Democratic Party will endeavor to:  Lower the age of legal majority and consent to 18. Actively encourage and assist in the election of youth to federal, state and local offices. Develop special programs for employment of youth, utilizing governmental resources to guarantee development, training and job placement, and Secure the electoral reforms called for under ""People and the Government."" Rights of Poor People. Poor people, like all Americans should be represented at all levels of the Democratic Party in reasonable proportion to their numbers in the general population. Affirmative action must be taken to ensure their representation at every level. The Democratic Party guidelines guaranteeing proportional representation to ""previously discriminated against groups"" (enumerated as 'women, young people and minorities') must be extended to specifically include poor people.  Political parties, candidates and government institutions at all levels must be committed to working with and supporting poor people's organizations and ending the tokenism and cooptation that has characterized past dealings. Welfare rights organizations must be recognized as representative of welfare recipients and be given access to regulations, policies and decision-making processes, as well as being allowed to represent clients at all governmental levels. The federal government must protect the right of tenants to organize tenant organizations and negotiate collective bargaining agreements with private landlords and encourage the participation of the tenants in the management and control of all subsidized housing. Rights of American Indians. We support rights of American Indians to full rights of citizenship. The federal government should commit all necessary funds to improve the lives of Indians, with no division between reservation and non-reservation Indians. We strongly oppose the policy of termination, and we urge the government to provide unequivocal advocacy for the protection of the remaining Indian land and water resources. All land rights due American Indians, and Americans of Spanish and Mexican descent, on the basis of treaties with the federal government will be protected by the federal government. American Indians should be given the right to receive bilingual medical services from hospitals and physicians of their choice. Rights of the Physically Disabled. The physically disabled have the right to pursue meaningful employment and education, outside a hospital environment, free from unnecessary discriminations living in adequate housing, with access to public mass transportation and regular medical care. Equal opportunity employment practices should he used by the government in considering their application for federal jobs and equal access to education from pre-school to the college level guaranteed. The physically disabled, like all disadvantaged peoples, should he represented in any group making decisions affecting their lives. Rights of the Mentally Retarded. The mentally retarded must he given employment and educational opportunities that promote their dignity as individuals and ensure their civil rights. Educational and treatment facilities must guarantee that these rights always will he recognized and protected. In addition. to assure these citizens a more meaningful life, emphasis must he placed on programs of treatment that respect their right to life in a non-institutional environment. Rights of the Elderly. Growing old in America for too many means neglect, sickness, despair and, all too often, poverty. We have tailed to discharge the basic obligation of a civilized people - to respect and assure the security of our senior citizens. The Democratic Party pledges, as a final step to economic security for all, to end poverty - as measured by official standards - among the retired, the blind and the disabled. Our general program of economic and social justice will benefit the elderly directly. In addition, a Democratic Administration should:  Increase social security to bring benefits into line with changes on the national standard of living. Provide automatic adjustments to assure that benefits keep pace with inflation. Support legislation which allows beneficiaries to earn more income, without reduction of social security payments. Protect individuals pension rights by pension re-insurance and early vesting. Lower retirement eligibility age to 60 in all government pension programs. Expand housing assistance for the elderly. Encourage development of local programs by which senior citizens can serve their community in providing education, recreation. counseling and other services to the rest of the population. Establish federal standards and inspection of nursing homes and full federal support for qualified nursing homes. Take the needs of the elderly and the handicapped into account in all federal programs, including construction of federal buildings, housing and transportation planning. Pending a full national health security system, expand Medicare by supplementing trust funds with general revenues in order to provide a complete range of care and services; eliminate the Nixon Administration cutbacks in Medicare and Medicaid; eliminate the part B premium under Medicare and include under Medicare and Medicaid the costs of eyeglasses, denture, hearing aids, and all prescription drugs and establish uniform national standards for Medicaid to bring to an end to the present situation which makes it worse to be poor in one state than in another. The Democratic Party pledges itself to adopt rules to give those over 60 years old representation on all Party committees and agencies as nearly as possible in proportion to their percentage in the total population. Rights of Veterans. It is time that the nation did far more to recognize the service of our 18 million living veterans and to serve them in return. The veterans of Vietnam must get special attention, for no end of the war is truly honorable which does not provide these men the opportunities to meet their needs. The Democratic Party is committed to extending and improving the benefits available to American veterans and society, to ending the neglect shown by the Nixon Administration to these problems and to the human needs of our ex-servicemen. Medical Care. The federal government must guarantee quality medical care to ex-servicemen, and to all disabled veterans, expanding and improving Veterans Administration facilities and manpower and preserve the independence and integrity of the VA hospital program. Staff-patient ratios in these hospitals should he made comparable to ratios in community hospitals. Meanwhile, there should be an increase in the VA's ability to deliver out-patient care and home health services, wherever possible treating veterans as part of a family unit. We support future integration of health care for veterans into the national health care insurance program, with no reduction in scale or quality of existing veterans care and with recognition of the special health needs of veterans. The VA separate personnel system should be expanded to take in all types of health personnel, and especially physician's assistants; and VA hospitals should be used to develop state medical schools and area health education centers. The VA should also assume responsibility for the care of wives and children of veterans who are either permanently disabled or who have died from service-connected causes. Distinction should no longer be made between veterans who have seen ""wartime,"" as opposed to ""peacetime,"" service. Education. Educational benefits should be provided for Vietnam-era veterans under the GI Bill at levels comparable to those of the original Bill after World War II, supplemented by special veteran's education loans. The VA should greatly expand improve programs for poor or educationally disadvantaged veterans. In addition, there should be a program under which servicemen and women can receive high school, college or job training while on active duty. GI Bill trainees should be used more extensively to reach out to other veterans who would otherwise miss these educational opportunities. Drug Addiction. The Veterans Administration should provide either directly or through community facilities a comprehensive, individually tailored treatment and rehabilitation program for all drug- and alcohol-addicted veterans, on a voluntary and confidential basis, and regardless of the nature of their discharge or the way in which they acquired their condition. Unemployment. There should be an increase in unemployment compensation provided to veterans, and much greater emphasis on the Veterans Employment Service of the Department of Labor, expanding its activities in every state. There should be a greatly enlarged effort by the federal government to employ Vietnam-era veterans and other veterans with service-connected disabilities. In addition, veterans' preferences in hiring should be written into every federal contract or subcontract and for public service employment. Rights of Servicemen and Servicewomen. Military discipline must be maintained, but unjustifiable restriction on the Constitutional rights of members of the armed service must cease.  We support means to ensure the protection of GI rights or express political opinion and engage in off-base political activity. We should explore new procedures for providing review of discharges other than honorable, in cases involving political activity. We oppose deferential advancement, punishment assignment or any other treatment on the basis of race, and support affirmative action to end discrimination. We support rights of women in the armed forces to be free from unfair discrimination. We support an amendment of the Uniform Code of Military Justice to provide for fair and uniform sentencing procedures. Rights of Consumers. Consumers need to be assured of a renewed commitment to basic rights and freedoms. They must have the mechanisms available to allow self-protection against the abuses that the Kennedy and Johnson programs we designed to eliminate. We propose a new consumer program: In the Executive Branch. The executive branch must use its power to expand consumer information and protection:  Ensure that every policy-making level of government concerned with economic or procurement decisions should have a consumer input either through a consumer advisory committee or through consumer members on policy advisory committees. Support the development of an independent consumer agency providing a focal point on consumer matters with the right to intervene as amicus curiae on behalf of the consumer before all agencies and regulatory bodies, and Expand all economic policy-making mechanisms to include an assessment of social as well as economic indicators of human well-being. In the Legislative Branch. We support legislation which will expand the ability of consumers to defend themselves:  Ensure an extensive campaign to get food, drugs and all other consumer products to carry complete informative labeling about safety, quality and cost. Such labeling is the first step in ensuring the economic and physical health of the consumer. In the food area, it should include nutritional unit pricing, full ingredients by percentage, grade, quality and drained weight information. For drugs, it should include safety, quality, price and operation data, either on the label or in an enclosed manual. Support a national program to encourage the development of consumer cooperatives patterned after the rural electric cooperatives in areas where they might help eliminate inflation and restore consumer rights, and Support federal initiatives and federal standards to reform automobile insurance and assure coverage as first part, on a no-fault basis. In the Judicial Branch. The courts should become an effective forum to hear well-founded consumer grievances.  Consumer class action: consumers should he given access to the federal courts in a way that allows them to initiate group action against fraudulent, deceitful, or misleading or dangerous business practices. Small Claims Court: A national program should he undertaken to improve the workings of small claims courts and spread their use so that consumers injured in economically small, though individually significant amounts (e.g. $500), can bring their complaints to the attention of a court and collect their damages without self-defeating legal fees. The Quality and Quantity of Social Service. The new Democratic Administration can begin a fundamental re-examination of all federal domestic social programs and the patterns of service delivery they support. Simply advocating the expenditure of more funds is not enough, although funds are needed, for billions already have been poured into federal government programs like urban renewal, current welfare and aid to education, with meager results. The control, structure and effectiveness of every institution and government grant system must be fully examined and these institutions must be made accountable to those they are supposed to serve. We will, therefore pursue the development of new rights at two kinds: Rights to the service itself and rights to participate in the delivery process. Health Care, Good health is the least this society should promise its citizens. The state of health services in this country indicates the failure of government to respond to this fundamental need. Costs skyrocket while the availability of services for all but the rich steadily decline. We endorse the principle that good health is a right of all Americans. America has a responsibility to offer to every American family the best in health care wherever they need it, regardless of income or where they live or any other factor. To achieve this goal the next Democratic Administration should:  Establish a system of universal National Health Insurance which covers all Americans with a comprehensive set of benefits including preventive medicine, mental and emotional disorders, and complete protection against catastrophic costs, and in which the rule of free choice for both provider and consumer is protected. The program should he federally-financed and federally-administered. Every American must know he can afford the cost of health care whether given in a hospital or a doctor's office. Incorporate in the National Health Insurance System incentives and controls to curb inflation in health care costs and to assure efficient delivery of all services. Continue and evaluate Health Maintenance Organizations. Set up incentives to bring health service personnel back to inner-cities and rural areas. Continue to expand community health centers and availability of early screening diagnosis and treatment. Provide federal funds to train added health manpower including doctors, nurses, technicians and para-medical workers. Secure greater consumer participation and control over health care institutions. Expand federal support for medical research including research in heart disease, hypertension, stroke, cancer, sickle cell anemia, occupational and childhood diseases which threaten millions and in preventive health care. Eventual replacement of all federal programs of health care by a comprehensive National Health Insurance System. Take legal and other action to curb soaring prices for vital drugs using anti-trust laws as applicable and amending patent laws to end price-raising abuses, and require generic-name labeling of equal-effective drugs, and Expand federal research and support for drug abuse treatment and education. especially development of non-addictive treatment methods. Family Planning. Family planning services, including the education, comprehensive medical and social services necessary to permit individuals freely to determine and achieve the number and spacing of their children, should be available to all, regardless of sex, age, marital status, economic croup or ethnic origin, and should be administered in a non-coercive and nondiscriminatory manner. Puerto Rico. The Democratic Party respects and supports the frequently-expressed desire of the people of Puerto Rico to freely associate in permanent union with the United States, as an autonomous commonwealth. We are committed to Puerto Rico's right to enjoy full self-determination and a relationship that can evolve in ways that will most benefit both parties. To this end, we support equal treatment for Puerto Rico in the distribution of all federal grants-in-aid, amendment of federal laws that restrict aid to Puerto Rico; and we pledge no further restrictions in future laws. Only in this way can the people of Puerto Rico come to participate more fully in the many areas of social progress made possible by Democratic efforts, on behalf of all the people. Finally, the Democratic Party pledges to end all Naval shelling and bombardment of the tiny, inhabited island of Culebra and its neighboring keys, no later than June 1, 1975. With this action, and others, we will demonstrate the concern of the Democratic Party to develop and maintain a productive relationship between the Commonwealth and the United States. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Trust Territories of the Pacific. We pledge to include all of these areas in federal grant-in-aid programs on a full and equitable basis. We praise the Democratic Congress for providing a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives from Guam and the Virgin Islands and urge that these elected delegates be accorded the full vote in the committees to which they are assigned. We support the right of American Samoans to elect their Governor, and will consider methods by which American citizens residing in American territories can participate in Presidential elections. IV. Cities, Communities, Counties and the Environment ""When the Democratic Platform is written and acted on in Miami, let it be a blueprint for the life and survival of our cities and our people. ""- Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson, Mayors' Conference, New Orleans, June 19, 1972 Introduction. Always the vital center of our civilization, the American city since World War II has been suffering growing pains, caused partly by the change of the core city into a metropolitan city and partly by the movement of people from towns and rural areas into the cities. The burgeoning of the suburbs - thrust outward with too little concern for social. economic and environmental consequences - has both broadened the city's limits and deepened human and neighborhood needs. The Nixon Administration has failed to meet most of these needs. It has met the problem of urban decay with tired, decaying ""solutions"" that are unworthy of the name. It could act to revitalize our urban areas; instead, we see only rising crime, fear and flight, racial and economic polarization, loss of confidence and depletion of community resources. This Administration has ignored the cities and suburbs, permitting taxes to rise and services to decline; housing to deteriorate faster than it can be replaced, and morale to suffer. It actually has impounded funds appropriated by a Democratic Congress to help cities in crisis. The Administration has ignored the needs of city and suburban residents for public services, for property tax relief and for the planning and coordination that alone can assure that housing, jobs, schools and transportation are built and maintained in suitable locations and in needed numbers and quality. Meanwhile, the Nixon Administration has forgotten smalltown America too, refusing to provide facilities that would make it an attractive alternative to city living. This has become the American crisis of the 1970's. Today, our highest national priority is clear and precise: To deal effectively - and now - with the massive, complex and urgent needs of our cities, suburbs and towns. The federal government cannot solve all the problems of these communities. Too often, federal bureaucracy has failed to deliver the services and keep the promises that are made. But only the federal government can be the catalyst to focus attention and resources on the needs of every neighborhood in America. Under the Nixon Administration, piecemeal measures, poorly funded and haphazardly applied, have proved almost totally inadequate. Words have not halted the decline of neighborhoods. Words have not relieved the plight of tenants in poorly managed, shoddy housing. Our scarce urban dollars have been wasted, and even the Republican Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has admitted it. The Democratic Party pledges to stop the rot in our cities, suburbs and towns. and stop it now. We pledge commitment, coordination. planning and funds:  Commitment to make our communities places where we are proud to raise our children. Coordination and planning to help all levels of government achieve the same goals, to ensure that physical facilities meet human needs and to ensure that land - a scarce resource - is used in ways that meet the needs of the entire nation, and Funds to reduce the burden of the inequitable property tax and to help local government meet legitimate and growing demands for public facilities and services. The nation's urban areas must and can be habitable. They are not only centers of commerce and trade, but also repositories of history and culture, expressing the richness and variety of their region and of the larger society. They are worthy of the best America can otter. They are America. Partnership Among Governments. The federal government must assist local communities to plan for their growth and development, to improve conditions and opportunities for all their citizens and to build the public facilities they need. Effective planning must be done on a regional basis. New means of planning are needed that are practical and realistic, but that go beyond the limits of jurisdictional lines. If local government is to be responsive to citizen needs, public services and programs must efficiently be coordinated and evolved through comprehensive regional planning and decision-making. Government activities should take account of the future as well as the present. In aiding the reform of state and local government, federal authority must insist that local decisions take into account the views and needs of all citizens, white and black, haves and have-nots, young and old, Spanish and other non-English-speaking, urban, suburban and rural. Americans ask more and more of their local government but the regressive property tax structure makes it impossible for cities and counties to deliver. The Democratic Party is: committed to ensure that state and local governments have the funds and the capacity to achieve community service and development goals - goals that are nationally recognized. To this end:  We fully support general revenue sharing and the principle that the federal income tax should be used to raise more revenues for local use. We pledge adequate federal funds to halt property increases and to begin to roll them back. Turning over federal funds to local governments will permit salaries of underpaid state and local government employees to climb to acceptable levels; and it will reduce tax pressures on the aged, the poor, Spanish and other non-English-speaking Americans and young couples starting out in life. We further commit ourselves to reorganize categorical grant programs. They should be consolidated, expanded and simplified. Funding should be adequate, dependable, sustained, long-term and related to state and local fiscal timetables and priorities. There should be full funding of all programs, without the impounding of funds by the Executive Branch to thwart the will of Congress. And there should be performance standards governing the distribution of all federal funds to state and local governments, and We support efforts to eliminate gaps and costly overlaps in services delivered by different levels of government. Urban Growth Policy. The Nixon Administrations has neither developed an effective urban growth policy designed to meet critical problems, nor concerned itself with the needed recreation of the quality of life in our cities, large and small. Instead, it has severely over-administered and underfunded existing federal aid programs. Through word and deed, the Administration has widened the gulf between city and suburb, between core and fringe, between haves and have-nots. The nation's urban growth policies are seen most clearly in the legitimate complaints of suburban householders over rising taxes and of center-city families over houses that are falling apart and services that are often non-existent. And it is here, in the center city, that the failure of Nixon Administration policies is most clear to all who live there. The Democratic Party pledges:  A national urban growth policy to promote a balance of population among cities, suburbs, small towns and rural areas, while providing social and economic opportunities for everyone. America needs a logical urban growth policy, instead of today's inadvertent, chaotic and haphazard one that doesn't work. An urban growth policy that truly deals with our tax and mortgage insurance and highway policies will require the use of federal policies as leverage on private investment. A policy on housing - including low- and middle-income housing - that will concentrate effort in areas where there are jobs, transportation, schools, health care and commercial facilities. Problems of over-growth are not caused so much by land scarcity as by the wrong distribution of people and the inadequate servicing of their needs, and A policy to experiment with alternative strategies to reserve land for future development - land banks - and a policy to recoup publicly created land values for public benefit. The Cities. Many of the worst problems in America are centered in our cities. Countless problems contribute to their plight: decay in housing, the drain of welfare, crime and violence, racism, failing schools. joblessness and poor mass transit, lack of planning for land use and services. The Democratic Party pledges itself to change the disastrous policies of the Nixon Administration toward the cities and to reverse the steady process of decay and dissolution. We will renew the battle begun under the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations to improve the quality of life in our cities. In addition to pledging the resources critically needed, we commit ourselves to these actions:  Help localities to develop their own solutions to their most pressing problems - the federal government should not stifle or usurp local initiative. Carry out programs developed elsewhere in this Platform to assure every American decent shelter, freedom from hunger, good health care, the opportunity to work, adequate income and a decent education. Provide sufficient management and planning funds for cities, to let them increase staff capacity and improve means of allocating resources. Distribute funds according to standards that will provide center cities with enough resources to revitalize old neighborhoods and build new ones, to expand and improve community vertices and to help local governments better to plan and deliver these services, and Create and fund a housing strategy that will recognize that housing is neighborhood and community as well as shelter - a strategy that will serve all the nation's urban areas and all the American people. Housing and Community Development. The 1949 Housing Act pledged ""a decent home and suitable living environment for every American family."" Twenty-three years later, this goal is still far away. Under this Administration, there simply has been no progress in meeting our housing needs, despite the Democratic Housing Act at 1963. We must build 2.6 million homes a year, including two-thirds of a million units of federally subsidized low- and middle-income housing. These targets are not being met. And the lack of housing is particularly critical for people with low and middle incomes.  In the cities, widespread deterioration and abandonment are destroying once sound homes and apartments, and often entire neighborhoods, faster than new homes are built. Federal housing policy creates walled compounds of poor, elderly and ethnic minorities, isolating them in the center city. These harmful policies include the Administration's approach to urban renewal discrimination against the center city by the Federal Housing Administration, highway policies that destroy neighborhoods and create ghettoes and other practices that work against housing for low and middle-income families. Millions of lower- and middle-class Americans - each year the income level is higher - are priced out of housing because of sharply rising costs. Under Republican leadership, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has become the biggest slumlord in the country. Some unsophisticated home buyers have purchased homes with FHA mortgage insurance or subsidies. These consumers, relying on FHA appraisals to protect them, often haze been exploited by real estate speculators and dishonest builders. Unable to repair or maintain these houses, the buyers often have no choice but to abandon them. As a result, the FHA will acquire a quarter million of these abandoned houses at a cost to the taxpayers of billions of dollars. Under the Republican Administration, the emphasis has been on housing subsidies for the people who build and sell houses rather than for those people who need and live in them. In many cases, the only decent shelter provided is a tax shelter. To correct this inequity the Democratic Party pledges:  To overhaul completely the FHA to make it a consumer-oriented agency. To use the full faith and credit of the Treasury to provide direct, low-interest loans to finance the construction and purchase of decent housing for the American people, and To insist on building practices, inspection standards and management that will assure quality housing. The next Administration must build and conserve housing that not only meets the basic need for shelter, but also provides a wider choice of quality housing and living environments. To meet this challenger the Democratic Party commits itself to a housing approach that:  Prevents the decay and abandonment of homes and neighborhoods. Major rehabilitation programs to conserve and rehabilitate housing are needed. Consumers should be aided in purchasing homes, and low-income housing foreclosed by the FHA should he provided to poor families at minimal cost as an urban land grant. These houses should be rehabilitated and lived in, not left to rot. Provides federal funds for preservation of existing neighborhoods. Local communities should decide whether they want renewal or preservation. Choosing preservation should not mean steady deterioration and inadequate facilities. Provides for improved housing quality for all families through strict enforcement of housing quality standards and full compliance with state and local health and safety laws. Provides effective incentives to reduce housing costs - to the benefit of poor and middle-income families alike through effective use of unused, undeveloped land, reform of building practices and the use of new building techniques, including factorymade and modular construction. Assures that residents have a strong voice in determining the destiny of their own neighborhoods. Promotes free choice in housing - the right of all families, regardless of race, color, religion or income, to choose among a wide range of homes and neighborhoods in urban, suburban and rural areas - through the greater use of grants to individuals for housing, the development of new communities offering diversified housing and neighborhood options and the enforcement of fair housing laws, and Assures fair and equitable relationships between landlords and tenants. New Towns. New towns meet the direct housing and community needs of only a small part of our population. To do more, new towns must be developed in concert with massive efforts to revitalize central cities and enhance the quality of life in still growing suburban areas. The Democratic Party pledges:  To strengthen the administration of the New Towns program; to reduce onerous review requirements that delay the start of New Towns and thus thwart Congressional mandates; to release already appropriated monies and provide new planning and development funds needed to assure the quality of life in New Towns; and To assure coordination between development of New Towns and renewed efforts to improve the quality of life in established urban and suburban areas. We also promise to use effectively the development of New Towns to increase housing choices for people now living in central and suburban areas. Transportation. Urban problems cannot be separated from transportation problems. Whether tying communities together, connecting one community to another or linking our cities and towns to rural areas, good transportation is essential to the social and economic life of any community. It joins workers to jobs, makes commercial activity both possible and profitable and provides the means for expanding personal horizons and promoting community cultural life. Today, however, the automobile is the principal form of transportation in urban areas. The private automobile has made a major contribution to economic growth and prosperity in this century. But now we must have better balanced transportation - more of it public. Today, 15 times as much federal aid goes to highways as to mass transit; tomorrow this must change. At the same time, it is important to preserve and improve transportation in America's rural areas, to end the crisis in rural mobility. The Democratic Party pledges:  To create a single Transportation Trust Fund, to replace the Highway Trust Fund, with such additional funds as necessary to meet our transportation crisis substantially from federal resources. This fund will allocate monies for capital projects on a regional basis, permitting each region to determine its own needs under guidelines that will ensure a balanced transportation system and adequate funding of mass transit facilities. Moreover, we will:  Assist local transit systems to meet their capital and operating needs. End the deterioration of rail and rural transportation and promote a flexible rural transportation system based on local, state and regional needs. Take steps to meet the particular transportation problems of the elderly, the handicapped and others with special needs, and Assist development of airport terminals, facilities and access to them, with due regard to impact on environment and community. Environment, Technology and Resources. Every American has the right to live, work and play in a clean, safe and healthy environment. We have the obligation to ourselves and to our children. It is not enough simply to prevent further environmental deterioration and the despoilation of our natural endowment. Rather, we must improve the quality of the world in which we and they will live. The Nixon Administration's record on the environment is one of big promises and small actions. Inadequate enforcement, uncertain requirements, reduced funding and a lack of manpower have undercut the effort commended by a Democratic Administration to clean up the environment. We must recognize the costs all Americans pay for the environmental destruction with which we all live: Poorer health, lessened recreational opportunities, higher maintenance costs, lower land productivity and diminished beauty in our surroundings. Only then can we proceed wisely, yet vigorously with a program of environmental protection which recognizes that, although environmental protection will not be cheap, it is worth a far greater price, in effort and money, than we have spent thus far. Such a program must include adequate federal funding for waste management, recycling and disposal and for purification and conservation of air and water resources. The next Administration must reconcile any conflicts among the goals of cleaner air and water, inexpensive power and industrial development and jobs in specific places. These difficulties do exist - to deny them would be deceptive and irresponsible. At the same time, we know they can be resolved by an Administration with energy, intelligence and commitment - qualities notably absent from the current Administration's handling of the problem. We urge additional financial support to the United States Forest Service for planning and management consistent with the environmental ideal stated in this Platform. Choosing the Right Methods of Environmental Protection. The problem we face is to choose the most efficient, effective and equitable techniques for solving each new environmental problem. We cannot afford to waste resources while doing the job, any more than we can afford to leave the job undone.  We must enforce the strict emission requirements on all pollution sources set under the 1970 Clean Air Act. We must support the establishment of a policy of no harmful discharge into our waters by 1985. We must have adequate staffing and funding of all regulatory and enforcement agencies and departments to implement laws, programs and regulations protecting the environment, vigorous prosecution of violators and a Justice Department committed to enforcement of environmental law. We must fully support laws to assure citizens' standing in federal environmental court suits. Where appropriate, taxes need to be levied on pollution to provide industry with an incentive to clean up. Strict interstate environmental standards must be formulated and enforced to prevent pollution from high-density population areas being dumped into low-density population areas for the purpose of evasion of strict pollution enforcement. The National Environmental Policy Act should be broadened to include major private as well as public projects, and a genuine commitment must be made to making the Act work. Our environment is most threatened when the natural balance of an area's ecology is drastically altered for the sole purpose of' profits. Such practices as ""clear cut"" logging, strip mining, the indiscriminate destruction of whole species, creation of select ocean crops at the expense of other species and the unregulated use of persistent pesticides cannot be justified when they threaten our ability to maintain a stable environment. We also need to develop new public agencies that can act to abate pollution - act on a scale commensurate with the size of the problem and the technology of pollution control. Expanded federal funding is required to assist local governments with both the capital and operating expenses of water pollution control and solid waste management. Jobs and the Environment. The United States should not be condemned to the choice between the development of resources and economic security or preservation of those resources. A decent job for every American is a goal that need not, and must not, be sacrificed to our commitment to a clean environment. Far from slowing economic growth, spending for environmental protection can create new job opportunities for many Americans. Nevertheless, some older and less efficient plants might find themselves in a worse competitive position due to environmental protection requirements. Closely monitored adjustment assistance should be made available to those plants willing to modernize and institute environmental protection measures. Science and Technology. For years, the United State was the world's undisputed leader in science and technology. Now that leadership is being challenged, in part because of the success of efforts in other countries, and in part because of the Nixon Administration's neglect of our basic human and material resources in this field. As Democrats, we understand the enormous investment made by the nation in educating and training hundreds of thousands of highly skilled Americans in science and technology. Many of these people are now unemployed, as aerospace and defense programs are slowly cut back and as the Administration's economic policies deprive these Americans, as well as others, of their livelihood. So far, however, the Nixon Administration has paid scant attention to these problems. By contrast, the Democratic Party seeks both to increase efforts by the federal government and to stimulate research in private industry. In addition, the Democratic Party is committed to increasing the overall level of scientific research in the United States, which has been allowed to fall under the Nixon Administration. And we are eager to take management methods and techniques developed for the space and defense programs, as well as our technical resources, and apply them to the city, the environment, education, energy, transportation, health care and other urgent domestic needs. We propose also to work out a more effective relationship between government and industry in this area, to stimulate the latter to a greater research and development effort, thus helping buoy up the economy and create more jobs. Finally, we will promote the search far new approaches in science and technology, so that the benefits of progress may be had without further endangering the environment - indeed, so that the environment may be better preserved. We must create a systematic way to decide which new technologies will contribute to the nation's development, and which will cause more problems than they solve. We are committed to a role for government in helping to bring the growth of technology into a harmonious relationship with our lives. Energy Resources. The earth's natural resources, once in abundant and seemingly unlimited supply, can no longer be taken for granted. In particular, the United States is facing major changes in the pattern of energy supply that will force us to reassess traditional policies. By 1980, we may well have to depend on imports from the Eastern Hemisphere for as much as 30 to 50 percent of our oil supplies. At the same time new forms of energy supply - such as nuclear, solar or geothermal power - lag far behind in research and development. In view of these concerns, it is shocking that the Nixon Administration still steadfastly refuses to develop a national energy policy. The Democratic Party would remedy that glaring oversight. To begin with, we should:  Promote greater research and development both by government and by private industry, of unconventional energy sources such as solar power, geothermal power, energy from water and a variety of nuclear power possibilities to design clean breeder fission and fusion techniques. Public funding in this area needs to be expanded, while retaining the principle of public administration of public funds. Re-examine our traditional view of national security requirements in energy to reconcile them with our need for long-term abundant supplies of clean energy at reasonable cost. Expand research on coal technology to minimize pollution, while making it possible to expand the efficiency of coal in meeting our energy needs. Establish a national power plant siting procedure to examine and protect environmental values. Reconcile the demand for energy with the demand to protect the environment. Redistribute the cost of power among consumers, so that all, especially the poor, may be guaranteed adequate power at reasonable costs. Develop a national power grid to improve the reliability and efficiency of our electricity system. End the practice of allowing promotional utility advertising as an expense when rates are set, and Find new techniques to encourage the conservation of energy. We must also require fun disclosure of the energy needs of consumer products and home heating to enable consumers to make informed decisions on their use of energy. The Oceans. As with the supply of energy, no longer can we take for granted the precious resources we derive from the oceans. Here. too, we need comprehensive national and international policies to use and protect the vast potential contained in the sea. In particular we must:  Agree with other nations on stopping pollution of the seas, if they are not one day to become one large sewer, or be filled with dangerous poisons that will deprive us of vital food resources. Agree with other nations on the conservation of food resources in the seas and promote the use of management techniques that will end the decline of the world's fish catch on the continental shelf through international cooperation for fishing gear regulations and species quota and preserve endangered species. Agree on an international accord for the seas, so resources can he shared equitably among the world's nations. We must be prepared to act constructively at next year's Conference on the Law of the Seas. Begin to reconcile competing interests in the future of the seas, including our national security objectives, to protect ocean resources in cooperation with other nations, and Support strongly the protection of ocean mammals (seal, whale, walrus) from indiscriminate destruction by both foreign and tuna fishing industries, but specifically exempting those native Americans whose subsistence depends completely on their total use of the ocean's resources. Ninety percent of all salt water fish species live on our continental shelves, where plant life is plentiful. For this reason, we support monitoring and strict enforcement of all safety regulations on all off-shore drilling equipment and on environmentally-safe construction of all tankers transporting oil. Public Lands. For generations, Americans have been concerned with preserving the natural treasures of our country: Our lakes and rivers, our forests and mountains. Enlightened Americans of the past decided that the federal government should take a major role in protecting these treasures, on behalf of everyone. Today, however, neglect on the part of the Nixon Administration is threatening this most valued heritage - and that of our children. Never before in modern history have our public lands been so neglected and the responsible agencies so starved of funds. The Democratic Party is concerned about preserving our public lands, and promoting policies of land management in keeping with the broad public interest. In particular, it is imperative to restore lost funds for land, park and forest management. It is imperative that decisions about the future use of our public lands be opened up to all the people for widespread public debate and discussion. Only through such an open process can we set ground rules that appropriately limit the influence of special interests and allow for cohesive guidelines for national landuse planning. We are particularly aware of the potential conflicts among the use of land, rivers, lakes and the seashore for economic development, large-scale recreation and for preservation as unspoiled wilderness. We recognize that there are competing goals, and shall develop means for resolving these conflicts in a way that reflects the federal government's particular responsibilities as custodian for the public. We need more National Seashores and expansion of the National Park system. Major steps must be taken to follow up on Congressional commitment to scenic riverways. Recreation areas must be made available to people where they live. This includes the extension of our national wilderness preserves to include de facto wilderness areas and their preservation free of commercialization. In this way, we will help to preserve and improve the quality of life for millions of our people. With regard to the development of the vast natural resources on our public lands, we pledge a renewed commitment to proceed in the interests of all our citizens. V. Education ""The American people want overwhelmingly to give to our children and adults equitable educational opportunities of the highest possible quality, not predicated on race, not predicated on past social accomplishment or wealth, except in a compensatory way to those who have been deprived in the past."" -Governor Jimmy Carter, Atlanta Hearing, June 9, 1972 Our schools are failing our children. Never, more than now, have we needed the schools to play their traditional role - to create a sense of national unity and to reconcile ethnic, religious and racial conflicts. Yet the Nixon Administration - by ignoring the plight of the nation's schools, by twice vetoing funds for education - has contributed to this failure. America in the 1970's requires something the world has never seen: Masses of educated people - educated to feel and to act, as well as to think. The children who enter school next fall still will be in the labor force in the year 2030; we cannot even imagine what American society will be like then, let alone what specific jobs they may hold. For them, education must be done by teaching them how to learn, how to apply man's wisdom to new problems as they arise and how to recognize new problems as they arise. Education must prepare students not just to earn a living but to live a life - a creative, humane and sensitive life. School Finance. Achieving educational excellence requires adequate financial support. But today local property taxes - which do not keep pace with inflation - can no longer support educational needs. Continued reliance on this revenue source imposes needless hardship on the American family without supplying the means for good schools. At the same time, the Nixon recession has sapped the resources of state government, and the Administration's insensitivity to school children has meant inadequate federal expenditures in education. The next Democratic Administration should:  Support equalization in spending among school districts. We support Court decisions holding unconstitutional the disparities in school expenditures produced by dependence on local property taxes. We pledge equality of spending as a way to improve schools and to assure equality of access to good education for all children. Increase federal financial aid for elementary and secondary education to enhance achievement of quality education anywhere, by fully funding the programs passed by the Congress and by fully funding ESEA Title I. Step up efforts to meet the special needs and costs of educationally disadvantaged children handicapped by poverty, disability or non-English-speaking family background. Channel financial aid by a Constitutional formula to children in non-public schools. Support suburban-urban cooperation in education to share resources and expenses. Develop and implement the retraining of displaced black and other minority teachers affected by desegregation, and Continue with full federal funding the breakfast and lunch programs for all children and the development of other programs to combat hunger. Early Childhood Education. Our youngest children are most ignored by national policy and most harshly treated by the Nixon Administration. President Nixon's cruel, irresponsible veto of the Comprehensive Child Development Act of 1971 indicates dramatically the real values of the present Administration. That legislation struck down by President Nixon remains the best program to bring support to family units threatened by economic and social pressure to eliminate educational handicaps which leave disadvantaged children unable to compete m school: to prevent early childhood disease before it results in adult disability; to interrupt the painful, destructive cycle of welfare dependence, and, most important, to allow all children happy lives as children and the opportunity to develop their full potential.  We support legislation for positive and preventive approaches to early childhood education. These approaches should be designed to help eliminate educational handicaps before they require remedial treatment. A Democratic President will support and sign a program for universal comprehensive child development. We should give reality to the right of mentally retarded children to adequate health care and educational opportunities through such measures as including necessary care under national health insurance and federal aid to assure an opportunity for education for all retarded persons. Equal Access to Quality Education. The Supreme Court of the United States in Brown v. Board of Education established the Constitutional principle that states may not discriminate between school children on the basis of their race and that separate but equal has no place in our public education system. Eighteen years later the provision of integration is not a reality. We support the goal of desegregation as a means to achieve equal access to quality education for all our children. There are many ways to desegregate schools: School attendance lines may be redrawn; schools may be paired; larger physical facilities may be built to serve larger, more diverse enrollments; magnet schools or educational parks may be used. Transportation of students is another tool to accomplish desegregation. It may continue to be available according to Supreme Court decisions to eliminate legally imposed segregation and improve the quality of education for all children. Bilingual Education. Ten percent of school children in the United States speak a language other than English in their homes and communities. The largest of the linguistic and cultural groups - Spanish-speaking and American Indians - are among the poorest people in the United States. Increasing evidence indicates an almost total failure of public education to educate these children. The drop-out rates of Spanish-speaking and Indian children are the worst of any children in the country. The injury is compounded when such children are placed in special ""compensatory"" programs or programs for the ""dumb"" or the ""retards"" on the basis of tests and evaluations conducted in English. The passage of the Bilingual Education Act of 1967 began a commitment by the nation to do something about the injustice committed against the bilingual child. But for 1972-73, Congress appropriated $35 million - enough to serve only two percent the children who need help. The next Democratic Administration should:  Increase federal support far bilingual, bicultural educational programs, pre-school through secondary school, including funding of bilingual Adult Basic Education. Ensure sufficient teacher training and curriculum development for such schools. Implement an affirmative action program to train and hire bilingual-bicultural Spanish-speaking persons at all levels of the educational system. Provide inventories for state and local districts to initiate bilingual-bicultural educational programs. Require testing of bilingual-bicultural children in their own languages, and  Prohibit discrimination against bilingual-bicultural children in school. Career Education. Academic accomplishment is not the only way to financial success, job satisfaction or rewarding life in America. Many young Americans think that college is the only viable route when for some a vocational-technical career offers as much promise of a full life. Moreover, the country desperately needs skilled workers, technicians, men and women who understand and can handle the tools and equipment that mean growth and jobs. By 1975 the need for skilled craftsmen will increase 18 percent while the need for college-trained persons will remain stable. Young people should be permitted to make a career choice consistent with their interests, aptitudes and aspirations. We must create an atmosphere where the dignity of work is respected, where diversity of talent and taste is encouraged and the continuing opportunity exists to keep pace with change and a saleable skill. To aid this, the next Democratic Administration can:  Give vocational-technical education the same priority in funds and emphasis previously given academic education. Support full appropriations for the recently-passed Occupational Education Act. Strengthen the career counseling programs in elementary, secondary and post-secondary education so that young people are made aware of all of the opportunities open to them and provide special kinds of vocational-technical education and experience to meet specific area needs. Develop and promote a climate conducive to free, rational choice by young people, dispelling the current prejudices that influence career decisions for most young people almost from birth. Establish a lifetime system of continuing education to enhance career mobility, both vertically and laterally, so that the career choice made at 18 or 20 years of age does not have to be the only or the final choice, and Grant equal representation to minorities and women in vocational-technical education. Higher Education. We support universal access to opportunities to post-secondary education. The American education system has always been an important path toward social and economic advancement. Federal education policy should ensure that our colleges and universities continue as an open system. It must also stimulate the creative development and expansion of higher education to meet the new social, economic and environmental problems confronting society. To achieve the goals of equal opportunity in education, to meet the growing financial crisis in higher education and to stimulate reform of educational techniques, the next Democratic Administration should:  Support guaranteed access for all students to loan funds with long-term repayment based on future earnings. Not only the poor, but families with moderate incomes must he provided relief from the cost of a college and professional education. Grant supplements and contingent loans to institutions, based on enrollment of federally-aided students. Provide research funds to stimulate a partnership between post-secondary, secondary and primary education, in an effort to find new patterns for learning and to provide training and re-training of teachers, especially in urban areas. Develop broad opportunities for lifelong learning including encouragement for post-secondary education throughout adult years and permit ""stopping-off"" during higher education. Develop affirmative programs in universities and colleges for recruitment of minorities and women for administrative and teaching positions and as students, and Create incentives for non-traditional education which recognize the contribution of experience to an individual's educational status. Arts and Humanities. Support for the arts and humanities is one of the benchmarks of a civilized society. Yet, the continued existence of many of America's great symphonies, theatres and museums, our film institutes, dance companies and other art forms, is now threatened by rising costs, and the public contribution, far less than in most advanced industrial societies, is a fraction of the need.  We should expand support of the arts and humanities by direct grants through the National Foundation for the Arts and Humanities, whose policy should be to stimulate the widest variety of artistic and scholarly expression. We should support long-range financing for public broadcasting, insulated from political pressures. We deplore the Nixon Administration's crude efforts to starve and muzzle public broadcasting, which has become a vital supplement to commercial television. VI. Crime, Law and Justice ""I think we can reduce crime. Society has no more important challenge because crime is human conduct and more than any other activity of people it reflects the moral character of a nation."" - Ramsey Clark, Washington Hearing, June 23, 1972 We advocate and seek a society and a government in which there is an attitude of respect for the law and for those who seek its enforcement and an insistence on the part of our citizens that the judiciary be ever mindful of their primary duty and function of punishing the guilty and protecting the innocent. We will insist on prompt, fair and equal treatment for all persons before the bar of justice. The problem of crime in America is real, immediate and fundamental; its costs to the nation are staggering; nearly three quarters of a million victims of violent crime in one year alone; more than 15,000 murders, billions of dollars of property loss. The indirect, intangible costs are even more ominous. A frightened nation is not a free nation. Its citizens are prisoners suspicious of the people they meet, restricted in when they go out and when they return, threatened even in their own homes. Unless government at all levels can restore a sense of confidence and security to its people, there is the ever-present danger that alarm will turn to panic, triggering short-cut remedies that jeopardize hard-won liberties. When law enforcement breaks down, not only the victims of street violence suffer; the worker's health and safety is imperiled by unsafe, illegal conditions on the job; the society is defenseless against fraud and pollution; most tragically of all, parents and communities are ravaged by traffic in dangerous drugs. The Nixon Administration campaigned on a pledge to reduce crime - to strengthen the ""peace forces"" against the ""criminal forces."" Despite claims to the contrary, that pledge has been broken:  Violent crime has increased by one-third, to the highest levels in our history. Fueled by the immense profits of narcotics traffic, organized crime has thrust its corruption farther and farther, into law enforcement agencies and the halls of justice. The Department of Justice has become the handmaiden of the White House political apparatus, offering favors to those special interests which buy their ""law"" in Washington. The Justice Department has failed to enforce laws protecting key legal rights, such as the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Nixon and Mitchell use federal crime control funds for political purposes, squandering $1.5 billion. To reverse this course, through equal enforcement of the law, and to rebuild justice the Democratic Party believes:  The impact of crime in America cuts across racial, geographic and economic lines. Hard-line rhetoric, pandering to emotion, is both futile and destructive. We can protect all people without undermining fundamental liberties by ceasing to use ""law and order"" as justification far repression and political persecution, and by ceasing to use stop-gap measures as preventive detention, ""no-knock"" entry, surveillance, promiscuous and unauthorized use of wire taps, harassment, and secret dossiers, and The problems of crime and drug abuse cannot be isolated from the social and economic conditions that give rise to them. Preventing Crime. Effective law enforcement requires tough planning and action. This Administration has given us nothing but tough words. Together with unequal law enforcement by police, prosecutors and judges, the result is a ""turnstile"" system of injustice, where most of those who commit crime are not arrested, most of those arrested are not prosecuted, and many of those prosecuted are not convicted. Under this Administration, the conviction rate for federal prosecutions has declined to one-half its former level. Tens of thousands of offenders simply never appear in court and are heard from again only when the commit another crime. This system does not deter crime. It invites it. It will be changed only when all levels of government act to return firmness and fairness to every part of the criminal justice system.  Fear of crime, and firm action against it, is not racism. Indeed the greatest victims of crime today - whether of business fraud or of the narcotics plague - are the people of the ghetto, black and brown. Fear now stalks their streets far more than it does the suburbs. So that Americans can again live without fear of each other the Democratic Party believes:  There must be equally stringent law enforcement for rich and poor, corporate and individual offenders. Citizens must be actively involved with the police in a joint effort. Police forces must be upgraded, and recruiting of highly qualified and motivated policemen must be made easier through federally assisted pay commensurate with the difficulty and importance of their job, and improved training with comprehensive scholarship and financial support for anyone who is serving or win contract to serve for an appropriate period of police service. The complex job of policing requires a sensitivity to the changing social demands of the communities in which police operate. We must provide the police with increased technological facilities and support more efficient use of police resources, both human and material. When a person is arrested, both justice and effective deterrence of crime require that he be speedily tried, convicted or acquitted, and if convicted, promptly sentenced. To this end we support financial assistance to local courts, prosecutors, and independent defense counsel for expansion, streamlining, and upgrading, with trial in 60 days as the goal. To train local and state police officers, a Police Academy on a par with the other service academies should be established as well as an Academy of Judicial Administration. We will provide every assistance to our law enforcement agencies at federal and local levels in the training of personnel and the improvement of techniques and will encourage mutual cooperation between each in its own sphere of responsibility. We will support needed legislation and action to seek out and bring to justice the criminal organizations of national scope operating in our country. We will provide leadership and action in a national effort against the usage of drugs and drug addiction, attacking this problem at every level and every source in a full scale campaign to drive this evil from our society. We recognize drug addiction as a health problem and pledge that emphasis will be put on rehabilitation of addicts. We will provide increased emphasis in the area of juvenile delinquency and juvenile offenses in order to deter and rehabilitate young offenders. There must be laws to control the improper use of hand guns. Four years ago a candidate for the presidency was slain by a hand gun. Two months ago, another candidate for that office was gravely wounded. Three out of four police officers killed in the line of duty are slain with hand guns. Effective legislation must include a ban on sale of hand guns known as Saturday night specials which are unsuitable for sporting purposes. A comprehensive fully funded program is needed to improve juvenile justice, to ensure minimum standards, to expand research into rehabilitation techniques, including alternatives to reform schools and coordinate existing programs for treating juvenile delinquency, and The block-grant system of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration which has produced ineffectiveness, waste and corruption should be eliminated. Funds should go directly to operating agencies that are committed to change and improvement in local law enforcement, including agencies concerned with research, rehabilitation, training and treatment. Narcotic Drugs. Drug addiction and alcoholism are health problems. Drugs prey on children, destroy lives and communities, force crimes to satisfy addicts, corrupt police and government and finance the expansion of organized crime. A massive national effort, equal to the scale and complexity of the problem, is essential. The next Democratic Administration should support:  A massive law enforcement effort, supported by increased funds and personnel, against the suppliers and distributors of heroin and other dangerous drugs. with increased penalties for major narcotics traffickers. Full use of all existing resources to halt the illegal entry of narcotics into the United States, including suspension of economic and military assistance to any country that fails to take appropriate steps to prevent narcotic drugs produced or processed in that country from entering the United States illegally, and increases in customs personnel fighting smuggling of hard drugs. An all-out investigative and prosecutory effort against corruption in government and law enforcement. Where corruption exists it is a major factor in permitting criminal activity, especially large-scale narcotic distribution, to flourish. It also destroys respect for the law in all who are conscious of its operation. We are determined that our children - whether in the ghetto or in a suburban high school - shall no longer be able to see a pusher protected from prosecution, openly plying his trade. Strict regulation and vigorous enforcement of existing quotas regulating production and distribution of dangerous drugs, including amphetamines and barbiturates. to prevent diversion into illegal markets, with legislation for strong criminal penalties against drug manufacturers engaging in illegal overproduction, distribution and importation. Expanded research into dangerous drugs and their abuse, focusing especially on heroin addiction among the young, development of effective, non-addictive heroin treatment. Concentration of law enforcement efforts on major suppliers and distributors with most individual users diverted into treatment before prosecution. Immediate placement in medical or psychiatric treatment available to any individual drug abuser without fear of disclosure or harrassment. Work opportunities should be provided for addicts in treatment by supported work and other programs, and Drug education in schools based on fact, not scare tactics to teach young people the dangers of different drugs, and full treatment opportunities for youthful drug abusers. Hard drug trafficking in schools must be met with the strongest possible law enforcement. Organized and Professional Crime. We are determined to exert the maximum power and authority of the federal government to protect the many victims who cannot help themselves against great criminal combinations.  Against the organized criminal syndicates, we pledge an expanded federal enforcement effort; one not restricted to criminals of any particular ethnic group, but which recognizes that organized crime in the United States cuts across all boundaries of race, national origin and class. Against white-collar crime, we pledge to enforce the maximum penalties provided by law. Justice cannot survive when, as too often is the case, a boy who steals a television set is sentenced to a long jail term, while a stock manipulator who steals millions is only commanded to sin no more. At least where life or personal injury are at stake, we pledge to seek expanded criminal penalties for the violation of federal laws. Employers who violate the worker safety and health laws, or manufacturers who knowingly sell unsafe products or drugs profit from death and injury as knowingly as the common mugger. They deserve equally severe punishment. Rehabilitation of Offenders. Few institutions in America are as uniformly condemned and as consistently ignored as in our existing prison system. Many prisons that are supposed to rehabilitate and separate, in fact train their inmates for nothing but brutality and a life of further crime. Only when public understanding recognizes that our existing ""corrections"" system contributes to escalating crime, will we get the massive effort necessary for fundamental restructuring. Therefore, the Democratic Party commits itself to:  Restoration, after release, of rights to obtain drivers' licenses and to public and private employment, and, after completion of sentence and conditions of parole, restoration of civil rights to vote and hold public office. Revision of sentencing procedures and greater use of community-based rehabilitation facilities, especially for juveniles. Recognition of the constitutional and human rights of prisoners; realistic therapeutic, vocational, wage-earning, education, alcoholism and drug treatment programs. Making correctional personnel an integral part of the rehabilitative process. Emergency, educational and work-release furlough programs as an available technique, support for ""self-help"" programs, and Restoration of civil rights to ex-convicts after completion of their sentences, including the right to vote, to hold public office to obtain drivers' licenses and to public and private employment. The Quality of Justice. Justice is not merely effective law enforcement - though that is an essential part of it. Justice rather, expresses the moral character of a nation and its commitment to the rule of law, to equality of all people before the law. The Democratic Parts believes that nothing must abridge the faith of the American citizens in their system of law and justice. We believe that the quality of justice will be enhanced by:  Equal treatment for all citizens in the court without fear or favor -- corporations as well as individual attenders. Swift trials for accused persons. Equitable pre-trial release systems and the elimination of plea bargaining abuse. Ending subversion of the legal system for political gain in court appointments, in anti-trust cases and in administration of law enforcement programs. Administering the laws and funding enacted by the Congress. Respecting and abiding by constitutional protections of due process, and Abolishing capital punishment, recognized as an effective deterrent to crime, unequally applied and cruel and excessive punishment . VII. Farming and Rural Life ""A blight hangs over the land caused by misguided farm policies."" - Tony Dechant, Sioux City, June 16, 1972 For many decades, American agriculture has been the envy of the world; and American farmers and American ranchers have made possible a level of nutrition and abundance for our people that is unrivaled in history, while feeding millions of people abroad. The basis far this success - and its promise for the future - lies with the family-type farm. It can and must be preserved, in the best interests at all Americans and the nation's welfare. Today, as dwindling income forces thousands of family farmers into bankruptcy each year, the family-type farm is threatened with extinction. American farming is passing to corporate control. These trends will benefit few of our people, while hurting many. The dominance of American food production by the large corporation would destroy individual enterprise and links that millions of our people have with the land; and it would lead to higher prices and higher food costs for everyone. Major efforts must be made to present this disaster for the fabric at rural life, for the American farmer, rancher, farm worker and for the consumer and other rural people throughout our nation:  Farm become must he improved to enable farmers, ranchers and farm workers to produce a steady and dependable supply of food and fiber products in return for full parity; and We must recognize and fulfill the social contract that exists between the family-farm producers of food and the non-farm consumer. The Democratic Party understands these urgent needs; the Nixon Administration does not and has failed the American farmer. Its record today is consistent with the Republican record of the past: Low prices, farm surpluses that depress the market in callous disregard for the people in rural America.  This Administration has sold out agriculture to interests bent on eliminating family-type farmers and bent on delivering agriculture to conglomerates, agribusiness giants and investors seeking to avoid taxes. Its policies hare driven farm income as low as 67 percent of parity, unequalled since the Depression. Between 50,000 and 75,000 farm families are driven off the land each year. Hundreds of thousands of demoralized people are being forced into overcrowded cities, emptying the countryside and bankrupting small business in rural towns and cities. The Nixon Administration tries to hide its failures by misleading the people, juggling the parity formula to make prices look higher, distorting reports to make corporate farming look insignificant and trying to break up the U.S. Department of Agriculture and still the farmer's voice. The Democratic Party will reverse these disastrous policies and begin to recreate a rural society of widespread family farming, individual opportunity and private and cooperative enterprises, where honest work will bring a decent income.  We repudiate the Administration's set-aside program, which pushes up the cost of farm programs while building huge surpluses that depress prices. We repudiate the Report of the USDA Young Executives Committee which would eliminate the family-type farm by ending price support, loan and purchasing programs on all farm commodities and which would put farm people on the welfare rolls. We repudiate a Presidential commission report recommending that future federal investment in many small towns and cities should make their decline merely more bearable rather than reverse it. In place of these negative and harmful policies, the Democratic Party pledges itself to take positive and decisive action:  We will replace the 1970 Farm Act, when it expires next year, with a permanent law to provide fair prices to family-type farm and ranch operators. This law will include loans and payments to farmers and effective supply management to raise family farm income to 100 percent of parity, based on the 1910 - 14 ratios; We will resist a price ceiling on agriculture products until farm prices reach 110 percent of parity based on the 1910 - 14 ratios, and we will conduct a consumer education program to inform all Americans of the relationship between the prices of raw commodities and retail prices: We will end farm program benefits to farm units larger than family-size, and  We will work for production adjustment that will assure adequate food and fiber for all our people, including low-income families and individuals whose purchasing power is supplemented with food stamps and that can provide enough commodities for export and for the Food for Peace Program. Exporting Our Abundance. For many years, farm exports have made a major contribution to our balances of trade and payments. But this benefit for the entire nation must not be purchased with depressed prices for the producer. The Democratic Party will ensure that:  Prices far commodities sent abroad as exports or aid return the cost of production plus a profit for the American farmer. We will negotiate international commodity agreements to include prices that guarantee prices to producers based on cost of production plus a reasonable profit. We will require U.S. corporations producing commodities outside the country for consumption here to pay duties high enough to prevent unfair competition for domestic producers. We will assure that the same rigid standards for inspection of domestic dairy products and meat will be applied to imports, and We will create a strategic reserve of storable commodities, insulated from the market, rotated regularly to maintain quality and stored to the extent possible on farms. Strengthening the Family Farm. These policies and actions will not be enough on their own to strengthen the family farm. The Democratic Party also recognizes that farmers and ranchers must be able to gain economic strength in the marketplace by organizing and bargaining collectively for the sale of their products. And they need to be free of unfair competition from monopoly and other restrictive corporate practices. We therefore pledge:  To remove all obstacles to farm bargaining for the sale of products. To extend authority for marketing orders to all farm commodities including those used for processing. To prohibit farming, or the gaining of monopolistic control of production, on the part of corporations whose resources and income derive primarily from non-farm sources. To investigate violations and enforce anti-trust laws in corporation-agriculture-agribusiness interlocks. To prohibit corporations and individuals from setting up tax shelters or otherwise engaging in agriculture primarily for the purpose of tax avoidance or tax loss. To encourage and support the use of cooperatives and membership associations in all areas of the country, which we pledge to protect from interference, punitive taxation or other hindrances, and To assist small rural cooperatives to promote projects in housing, health, social services, marketing, farming employment and transportation for rural areas with such things as technical assistance and credit. Guaranteeing Farm People a Voice. None of these policies can begin to work unless farmers, ranchers, farm workers and other rural people have full rights of participation in our democratic institutions of government. The Democratic Party is committed to seeing that family-type farmers and ranchers will be heard and that they will have ample opportunity to help shape policies attesting agriculture and rural America. To this end:  We support the appointment of a farmer or rancher as Secretary of Agriculture. We oppose all efforts to abolish or dismantle the U.S. Department of Agriculture. We will require that decisions relating to dams and other public land-use projects in rural areas involving federal funds be considered at well-publicized public hearings. Government is not now giving adequate protection to individual rights in condemnation procedures. It must set new and better procedures and requirements to assure individual rights. We support the United Farm Workers in their non-violent efforts to gain collective bargaining recognition and contracts. We also support unemployment insurance compensation benefits, workman's compensation benefits and delivery of health services for farm workers, and We support the removal of sugar workers from the custody of the U.S. Department at Agriculture. Revitalizing Rural America. Sound rural development must start with improved farm income, which also promotes the prosperity of the small businesses that serve all rural people. But there must be other efforts, as well, to ensure equity for farm and rural people in the American economy. The Democratic Party pledges:  To support the rural cooperative electrification and telephone programs and to implement rural transportation programs as explained in the section Cities, Communities, Counties and the Environment of this Platform. We will extend the agricultural exemption in the Motor Carriers Act to products and supplies and ensure rural areas an equitable share of Highway Trust Funds. To apply general revenue sharing in ways that will permit state and local taxation of family farm lands on the basis of value for farm use rather than value for land speculation. To guarantee equal treatment of rural and urban areas in the provision of federal funds for schools, poverty programs, health facilities, housing highways, air services, pollution control, senior citizen programs and employment opportunities and manpower and training programs. To provide loans to aid young farm families and small businesses to get established in rural areas, and To ensure agricultural research toward an examination of the social and economic consequences of technology. The prime goal of land grant colleges and research should be to help family farms and rural people. VIII. Foreign Policy ""The Administration is continuing a war - continuing the killing of Americans and Vietnamese - when our national security is not at stake. ""It is our duty as the opposition party to point out the Administration's errors and to offer a responsible alternate""- W. Averell Harriman, New York Hearing, June 22, 1972 Strength in defense and wisdom in foreign affairs are essential to prosperity and tranquility. In the modern world, there can be no isolationism in reality or policy. But the measure of our nation's rank in the world must be our success in achieving a just and peaceful society at home. For the Nixon Administration, foreign policy results have fallen short of the attention and the slogans.  After four years of ""Vietnamization,"" the war in Southeast Asia continues and Nixon's plan is still a secret. Vital foreign policy decisions are made without consulting with Congress or our allies, and Executive secrecy runs wild with unparalleled efforts to intimidate the media and suppress those who seek to put a different view before the American people. The next Democratic Administration should:  End American participation in the war in Southeast Asia. Re-establish control over military activities and reduce military spending, where consistent with national security. Defend America's real interests and maintain our alliances, neither playing world policeman nor abandoning old and good friends. Not neglect America's relations with small third-world nations in placing reliance on great power relationships. Return to Congress, and to the people, a meaningful role in decisions on peace and war, and Make information public, except where real national defense interests are involved. Vietnam. Nothing better describes the need for a new American foreign policy than the fact that now, as for the past seven years, it begins with the war in Vietnam. The task now is still to end the war, not to decide who is to blame for it. The Democratic Party must share the responsibility for this tragic war. But, elected with a secret plan to end this war, Nixon's plan is still secret, and we - and the Vietnamese - have had four more years of fighting and death. It is true that our involvement on the ground has been reduced. Troops are coming home. But the war has been extended in Laos and Cambodia; the bombing of North Vietnam has been expanded to levels of destruction undreamed of four years ago; North Vietnam has been blockaded; the number of refugees increases each day, and the Secretary of Defense warns us of still further escalation. All this has accomplished nothing except to prolong the war. T he hollowness of ""Vietnamization"" - a delusive slogan seeming to offer cheap victory - has been exposed by the recent offensive. The Saigon Government, despite massive U.S. support is still not viable. It is militarily ineffective, politically corrupt and economically near collapse. Yet it is for this regime that Americans still die, and American prisoners still rot in Indo-China camps. The plight of these American prisoners justly arouses the concern of all Americans. We must insist that any resolute war include the return of all prisoners held by North Vietnam and other adversary forces and the fullest possible accounting for the missing. With increasing lack of credibility, the Nixon Administration has sought to use the prisoners of war as an excuse for its policies. It has refused to make the simple, definite and final end to U.S. participation in the war, in conjunction with return of all U.S. prisoners. The majority of the Democratic Senators have called for full U.S. withdrawal by October 1, 1972. We support that position. If the war is not ended before the next Democratic Administration takes office, we pledge, as the first order of business, an immediate and complete withdrawal of all U.S. farces in Indo-China. All U.S. military action in Southeast Asia will cease. After the end of U.S. direct combat participation, military aid to the Saigon Government, and elsewhere in Indo-China, will be terminated. The U.S. will no longer seek to determine the political future of the nations of Indo-China. The issue is not whether we will depose the present South Vietnamese Government, rather when we will cease insisting that it must be the core of any political settlement. We will do what we can to foster an agreement on an acceptable political solution - but we recognize that there are sharp limits to our ability to influence this process, and to the importance of the outcome to our interest. Disengagement from this terrible war will not be a ""defeat"" for America. It will not imply any weakness in America's will or ability to protect its vital interests from attack. On the contrary disengagement will enable us to heal domestic diversions and to end the distortion of our international priorities which the war has caused. A Democratic Administration will act to ease the hard transitions which will come with an end to this war. We pledge to offer to the people of Vietnam humanitarian assistance to help them repair the ravages of 30 years of war to the economy and to the people of that devastated land. To our own people, we pledge a true effort to extend the hand of reconciliation and assistance to those most affected by the war. T those who have served in this war, we pledge a full G.I. Bill of Rights, with benefits sufficient to pay for an education of the veteran's choice, job training programs and the guarantee of employment and the best medical care this country can provide, including a full program of rehabilitation for those who hare returned addicted to dangerous drugs. To those who for reasons of conscience refused to serve in this war and were prosecuted or sought refuge abroad, we state our firm intention to declare an amnesty, on an appropriate basis, when the fighting has ceased and our troops and prisoners of war have returned. Military Policy. We propose a program of national defense which is both prudent and responsible, which will retain the confidence of our allies and which will be a deterrent to potential aggressors. Military strength remains an essential element of a responsible international policy. America must have the strength required for effective deterrence. But military defense cannot be treated in isolation from other vital national concerns. Spending for military purposes is greater by far than federal spending for education, housing, environmental protection, unemployment insurance or welfare. Unneeded dollars for the military at once add to the tax burden and pre-empt funds from programs of direct and immediate benefit to our people. Moreover, too much that is now spent on defense not only adds nothing to our strength but makes us less secure by stimulating other countries to respond. Under the Nixon stewardship of our defense policy, lack of sound management controls over defense projects threatens to price us out of an adequate defense. The reaction of the Defense Department to exposure of cost overruns has been to strike back at the critics instead of acting to stop the waste. Needless projects continue and grow, despite evidence of waste, military ineffectiveness and even affirmative danger to real security. The ""development"" budget starts pressure for larger procurement budgets in a few years. Morale and military effectiveness deteriorate as drugs, desertion and racial hatreds plague the armed forces, especially in Vietnam. The Democratic Party pledges itself to maintain adequate military forces for deterrence and effective support of our international position. But we will also insist on the firm control of specific costs and projects that are essential to ensure that each defense dollar makes a real contribution to national security. Specifically, a Democratic Administration should:  Plan military budgets on the basis of our present needs and commitments, not past practices or force levels. Stress simplicity and effectiveness in new weapons and stop goldplating and duplication which threaten to spawn a new succession of costly military white elephants; avoid commitment to new weapons unless and until it becomes clear that they are needed. Reject calls to use the SALT agreement as an excuse for wasteful and dangerous acceleration of our military spending. Reduce overseas bases and forces, and Rebuild the morale and military tradition of our armed farces through creative programs to combat drug abuse, racial tensions and eroded pride in service. We will support reforms of the conditions of military life to restore military service as an attractive career for men and women from all segments of our society. By these reforms and this new approach to budgeting coupled with a prompt end to U.S. involvement in the war in Indo-China, the military budget can be reduced substantially with no weakening of our national security. Indeed a leaner, better-run system will mean added strength, efficiency and morale for our military forces. Workers and industries now dependent on defense spending should not be made to pay the price of altering our priorities. Therefore, we pledge reconversion policies and government resources to assure jobs and new industrial opportunities for all those adversely affected by curtailed defense spending. Draft. We urge abolition of the draft. Disarmament and Arms Control. The Democratic Party stands for keeping America strong; we reject the concept of unilateral reductions below levels needed for adequate military defense. But effective international arms control and disarmament do not threaten American security; they enhance it. The last Democratic Administration took the lead in pressing for U.S.-Soviet agreement on strategic arms limitation. The recent SALT agreement is an important and useful first step. The SALT agreement should be quickly ratified and taken as a starting point for new agreements. It must not be used as an excuse for new ""bargaining chip"" military programs or the next round of the arms race. The next Democratic Administration should:  Carry on negotiations to expand the initial SALT agreement to other areas, especially to seek limits to the qualitative arms race and to begin reducing force levels on each side. Seek a comprehensive ban on all nuclear testing, verified, as SALT will be, by national means. Press for wide adherence to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, signed in 1968, and for extension of the concept of nuclear-free regions. Seek ratification of the Protocol on Chemical Warfare without reservations. In concert with our allies, pursue with the U.S.S.R. mutual force reductions in Europe, and Widen the range of arms control discussions to include new subjects, such as mutual budget cuts, control of arms transfer to developing countries, restrictions on naval force deployments and other measures to limit conventional forces. U.S. and the World Community. A new foreign policy must be adequate for a rapidly changing world. We welcome the opportunity this brings for improved relations with the U.S.S.R. and China. But we value even more America's relations with our friends and allies in the Hemisphere, in Western Europe, Japan and other industrialized countries, Israel and the Middle East, and in the developing nations of Asia and Africa. With them, our relations must be conducted on a basis of mutual trust and consultation, seeking to strengthen our ties and to resolve differences on a basis of mutual advantage. Throughout the world, the focus of our policy should be a commitment to peace, self-determination, development, liberty and international cooperation, without distortion in favor of military points of view. Europe. Europe's increasing economic and political strength and the growing cooperation and self-confidence of its people have made the Atlantic Alliance a partnership of equals. If we face the challenge of this new relationship, our historic partnership can endure. The next Democratic Administration should:  Reduce U.S. troop levels in Europe in close consultation with our allies, as part of a program to adjust NATO to changed conditions. What is essential in our relations with the other NATO nations is not a particular troop level, but our continued commitment to collective defenses Pledge to work in greater cooperation with the European economic communities to ensure that integration in Europe does not serve as a formula for discrimination against American goods and enterprises. Cease American support for the repressive Greek military government, and Make the voice of the United States heard in Northern Ireland against violence and terror and against the discrimination, repression and deprivation which brought about that awful civil strife. We welcome every improvement in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union and every step taken toward reaching vital agreements on trade and other subjects. However, in our pursuit of improved relations, America cannot afford to be blind to the continued existence of serious differences between us. In particular. the United States should, by diplomatic contacts, seek to mobilize world opinion to express concern at the denial to the oppressed peoples of Eastern Europe and the minorities of the Soviet Union, including the Soviet Jews, of the right to practice their religion and culture and to leave their respective countries. Middle East. The United States must be unequivocally committed to support of Israel's right to exist within secure and defensible boundaries. Progress toward a negotiated political settlement in the Middle East will permit Israel and her Arab neighbors to live at peace with each other, and to turn their energies to internal development. It will also free the world from the threat of the explosion of Mid-East tensions into world war. In working toward a settlement, our continuing pledge to the security and freedom of Israel must be both clear and consistent. The next Democratic Administration should:  Make and carry out a firm, long-term public commitment to provide Israel with aircraft and other military equipment in the quantity and sophistication she needs to preserve her deterrent strength in the face of Soviet arsenaling of Arab threats of renewed war. Seek to bring the parties into direct negotiations toward a permanent political solution based on the necessity of agreement on secure and defensible national boundaries. Maintain a political commitment and a military force in Europe and at sea in the Mediterranean ample to deter the Soviet Union from putting unbearable pressure on Israel. Recognize and support the established status of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, with free access to all its holy places provided to all faiths. As a symbol of this stand, the U.S. Embassy should be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and Recognize the responsibility of the world community for a just solution to the problems of the Arab and Jewish refugees. Africa. The central feature of African politics today is the struggle against racism and colonialism in Southern Africa. There should be no mistake about which side we are on. We stand for full political, civil and economic rights for black and other non-white peoples in Southern Africa. We are against white-minority rule. We should not underwrite a return to the interventionism of the past. But we can end United States complicity with such governments. The focus of America's concern with Africa must be on economic and social development. Economic aid to Africa, without political conditions, should be expanded, and African states assured an adequate share of the aid dollar. Military aid and aid given for military purposes should he sharply reduced.  All military aid to Portugal should be stopped and the Nixon $435 million deal for unneeded Azores bases should be cancelled. U.N. sanctions against the illegal racist regime in Southern Rhodesia should be supported vigorously, especially as they apply to chrome imports. The U.S. should give full support to U.N. assertion of its control over Namibia (South West Africa), in accordance with the World Court's ruling. The U.S. should make clear its opposition to the radar totalitarianism of South Africa. The U.S. government should act firmly to press U.S. businesses in South Africa to take measures for the fullest possible justice for their black employees. Blacks should be assigned at all levels to U.S. offices in South Africa, and throughout Africa. The South African sugar quota should be withdrawn. No U.S. company or its subsidiary should be given U.S. tax credit for taxes paid to white-minority-ruled countries of Africa. Asia. Japan. Our relations with Japan have been severely strained by a series of ""Nixon shocks."" We must restore our friendship with Japan, the leading industrial nation of Asia and a growing world power. There are genuine issues between us and Japan in the economic area, but accommodation of trade problems will be greatly eased by an end to the Nixon Administration's calculated insensitivity to Japan and her interests, marked by repeated failures to afford advance warnings, much less consultation over sudden shifts in U.S. diplomatic and economic policy that affect Japan. India, Pakistan and Bangla Desh. A Democratic Administration should work to restore the damage done to America's friendship with India as a result of the Administration's folly in ""tilting"" in favor of Pakistan and against Bangla Desh. The alienation by the Nixon Administration of India, the world's largest democracy, and the continued suspension of economic aid to India have seriously damaged the status of the United States in Asia. We pledge generous support for the essential work of reconstruction and reconciliation in Bangla Desh. At the same time, we will maintain friendship and developmental assistance to the ""new"" Pakistan which has emerged from these sad events. China. The beginning of a new U.S.-China relationship is welcome and important. However, so far, little of substance has changed, and the exaggerated secrecy and rhetoric of the Nixon Administration have produced unnecessary complications in our relationship with our allies and friends in Asia and with the U.S.S.R. What is needed now is serious negotiation on trade, travel exchanges and progress on more basic issues. The U.S. should take the steps necessary to establish regular diplomatic relations with China. Other Asian Countries. The future of Asia will be determined by its people, not by the United States. We should support accommodation and cooperation among all Asian countries and continue to assist in economic development. Canada. A Democratic Administration should restore close U.S.-Canadian cooperation and communication, respecting Canada's nationhood and pride. In settling economic issues, we should not compromise our interests, but seek mutually advantageous and equitable solutions. In areas such as environmental protection and social policies, the Americans and Canadians share common problems and we must act together. Latin America. The Good Neighbor policy of Franklin Roosevelt and the Alliance for Progress of John Kennedy set still-living goals - insulation from external political conflicts, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, and support for political liberty, social justice and economic progress. The Nixon Administration has lost sight of these goals, and the result is hostility and suspicion of the U.S. unmatched in generations. The next Democratic Administration should:  Re-establish an inter-American alliance of equal sovereign nations working cooperatively for development. Sharply reduce military assistance throughout the area. Strive to deepen the exchange of people and ideas within the Hemisphere. Take account of the special claims of democratically elected governments on our resources and sympathy. Pursue a policy of non-intervention by military means in domestic affairs of Latin American nations. Recognize that, while Cuba must not be permitted to become a foreign military base, after 13 years of boycott, crisis and hostility the time has come to re-examine our relations with Cuba and to seek a way to resolve this cold war confrontation on mutually acceptable terms, and Re-establish a U.S. - Mexico border commission, with Mexican-American representatives, to develop a comprehensive program to desalinate and eradicate pollution of the Colorado River and other waterways flowing into Mexico, and conduct substantial programs to raise the economic level on both sides of the border. This should remove the economic reasons which contribute to illegal immigration and discourage run-away industries. In addition, language requirements for citizenship should be removed. The United Nations. The U.N. cannot solve all the great political problems of our time, but in an increasingly interdependent world, a world body is essential and its potential must be increasingly relied upon. The next Democratic Administration should:  Re-establish the U.N. as a key forum for international activity and assign representatives with the highest qualification for diplomacy. Give strong executive branch leadership for U.S. acceptance of its obligations for U.N. financing, while renegotiating arrangements for sharing U.N. costs. Abide by the binding U.N. Security Council decision on Rhodesia sanctions, and support U.N. peace-keeping efforts. Work for development of enforceable world law as a basis for peace, and endorse repeal of the Connally Reservation on U.S. acceptance of World Court jurisdiction, and Work to involve the U.N. increasingly on the complex technical and social problems such as pollution, health. communication, technology and population policy, which are worldwide in scope and demand a worldwide approach, and help provide the means for these U.N. efforts and for U.N. economic development functions. International Economic Policy. In a prosperous economy, foreign trade has benefits for virtually everyone. For the consumer, it means lower prices and a wider choice of goods. For the worker and the businessman, it means new jobs and new markets. For nations it means greater efficiency and growth. But in a weak economy - with over five million men and women out of work - foreign imports bring hardships to many Americans. The automobile or electrical worker, the electronics technician, the small businessman - for them, and millions of others, foreign competition coinciding with a slack economy has spelled financial distress. Our national commitment to liberal trade policies takes its toll when times are bad, but yields its benefits when the economy is fully employed. The Democratic Party proposes no retreat from this commitment. Our international economic policy should have these goals: To expand jobs and business opportunities in this country and to establish two-way trade relations with other nations. To do this, we support the following policies:  End the high-unemployment policy of the Nixon Administration. When a job is available for everyone who wants work, imports will no longer be a threat. Full employment is a realistic goal, it is a goal which has been attained under Democratic Administrations, and it is a goal we intend to achieve again. Adopt broad programs to ease dislocations and relieve the hardship of workers injured by foreign competition. Seek higher labor standards in the advanced nations where productivity far outstrips wage rates, thus providing unfair competition to American workers and seek to limit harmful flows of American capital which exploit both foreign and American workers. Adhere to liberal trade policies, but we should oppose actions and policies which harm American workers through unfair exploitation of labor abroad and the encouragement of American capital to run after very low wage opportunities for quick profits that will damage the economy of the United States and further weaken the dollar. Negotiate orderly and reciprocal reductions of trade barriers to American products. Foreign nations with access to our markets should no longer be permitted to fence us out of theirs. Support reform of the international monetary system. Increased international reserves, provision for large margins in foreign exchange fluctuations and strengthened institutions for the coordination of national economic policies can free our government and others to achieve full employment. Support efforts to promote exports of American farm products, and Develop ground rules for pollution controls with our industrialized trading partners so that no country gains competitive advantage at the expense of the environment. Developing Nations. Poverty at home or abroad is part of a common problem. Great and growing income gaps among nations are no more tenable than such gaps among groups in our own country. We should remain committed to U.S. support for economic and social development of countries in need. Old ways of providing aid must be revised - to reduce U.S. involvement in administration to encourage other nations to contribute jointly with us. But funding must be adequate to help poor countries achieve accelerated rates of growth. Specifically, the next Democratic Administration should support:  Provision of more assistance through international organizations, along with measures to strengthen the development agencies of the U.N. A curtailment of military aid. Improved access to the markets of industrial nations for the products of the developing countries. A greater role in international monetary affairs for poor countries; in particular distributing the new Special Drawing Rights in support of the poor countries, and A fair share for poor countries in the resources of the seabeds. The Methods and Structures of U.S. Foreign and Military Policy. The needed fundamental reordering of U.S. foreign and military policy calls for changes in the structure of decisionmaking, as well as in particular policies. This means:  Greater sharing with Congress of real decisions on issues of war and peace, and providing Congress with the information and resources needed for a more responsible role. More honest information policies, beginning with a fundamental reform of the document classification system and including regular press conferences by the President, his cabinet and senior advisers. Ending the present drastic overbalance in favor of military opinion by redefining the range of agencies and points of view with a proper claim to be heard on foreign and military policies. Subjecting the military budget to effective civilian control and supervision. Establishing effective executive control and legislative oversight of the intelligence agencies. Ending political dimination of USIA's reporting and Peace Corps dedication and, in general, making it clear that the White House understands the crucial distinction between dissent and disloyalty, and Urging the appointment of minority Americans to top positions of ambassadors and diplomats, to let the world know that America is a multi-racial nation and proud of it. IX. The People and the Government ""Our people are disspirited because there seems to be no way by which they can call to office a government which will cut the ties to the past, meet the challenge of leadership and begin a new era of bold action. ""Bold action by innovative government - responsive to the people's needs and desires - is essential to the achievement of our national hopes."" - Leonard Woodcock, New York Hearing, June 22, 1972 Representative democracy fails when citizens cannot know:  When public officials ignore or work against the principles of due process. How their public officials conduct the public's business. Whether public officials have personal financial stakes in the very matters they are legislating, administering or enforcing, and What special interest pressures are being exerted on public officials by lobbyists. Today, it is imperative that the Democratic Party again take the lead in reforming those practices that limit the responsiveness of government and remove it from the control of the people. Seniority. The seniority system is one of the principal reasons that party platforms - and parties themselves - have lost meaning and importance in our political life. Seniority has weakened Congress as an effective and responsive institution in a changing society. It has crippled effective Congressional leadership and made it impossible to present and enact a coherent legislative program. It has permitted the power of the Democratic majority to be misused and abused. It has stifled initiative and wasted the talents of many members by making length of service the only criterion for selection to the vital positions of Congressional power and leadership. We, therefore, call on the Democratic Members of the Congress to use the powers inherent in their House and Senate caucuses to implement the policies and programs of the National Democratic Party. It is specifically not intended that Democratic members be directed how to vote on issues on the floor. But, in order that they be responsive to broad party policies and programs, we nonetheless call upon Members of Congress to:  Choose committee chairmen as provided in existing caucus rules and procedures, but by separate open ballot; chairpeople should be chosen who will carry out party policies and programs which come within the jurisdiction of their committees. Assure that Democratic programs and policies receive full and fair consideration and are brought to a vote in each house. Discipline committee members, including chairpeople, who refuse to comply with caucus instructions, regarding the reporting of legislation from their committees, and Withhold any seniority benefits from a Member of Congress who fails to overtly identify with the Democratic organization in his state which is recognized by the National Democratic Party. Secrecy. Public business should be transacted publicly, except when national security might be jeopardized. To combat secrecy in government, we call on the Democratic Members of Congress and state legislatures to:  Enact ""open meetings"" legislation, barring the practice of conducting the public business behind closed doors. This should include so-called mark-up sessions by legislative committees, but should allow for exceptions involving national security and invasions of privacy. To the extent possible, the same principle should apply to the Executive Branch. Assure that all committee and floor votes are taken in open session, recorded individually for each legislator; record caucus votes, and make all of these votes available to the public. Urge reservation of executive privilege for the President alone. Urge that the judgment in the U.S. Senate in a contested election case be rendered in open Senate session. Immediately strengthen the Federal Freedom of Information Act. Congress should improve its oversight of Executive secrecy by requiring federal agencies to report annually on every refusal to grant information requested under the Act. Citizens should have full recourse to the courts to deal with violation or circumvention of the Act. It should be amended to allow courts to review the reasonableness of a claim of executive privilege, and Administer the security system so as to limit the number of officials who can make a document secret, and provide for frequent declassification of documents. Congress should be given the means to obtain documents necessary to fulfill its responsibilities. We also call on the Democratic Members of the House of Representatives to take action through their caucuses to end the ""closed rule,"" which is used to prevent amendments and votes on vital tax matters and other important issues, and we call on the Democratic Members of the Senate to liberalize the cloture rule, which is used to prevent votes in that body, so that after full and extensive debate majority rule can prevail. Administrative Agencies. There is, among more and more citizens, a growing revolt against large, remote and impersonal governmental agencies that are not responsive to human needs. We pledge to build a representative process into the Executive Branch, so that individuals affected by agency programs can be involved in formulating, implementing and revising them. This requires a basic restructuring of procedures -- public hearings before guidelines and regulations are handed down, the processing of citizen complaints, the granting of citizen standing and the recovery of litigation fees for those who win suits against the government. We recommend these specific changes in the rule-making and adjudication process of the federal government:  There should be no non-written communication between an agency and outside parties about pending decisions. All written communications should promptly be made a part of the public record. All communications between government employees and outside parties about possible future action should be made a part of the public record. All government employees involved in rule-making and adjudication should be subject to conflict of interest laws. The Justice Department should make available to the public any consent decree 90 days prior to its submission to court, to allow any interested party to comment on it to the court, and The Justice Department should report to Congress each year, to explain its action on major suits. In addition, we must more effectively protect consumer rights before the government. The consumer must be made an integral part of any relationship between government and institutions (public or private) at every level of proceedings whether formal or informal. A Democratic Administration would instruct all federal agencies to identify American Indians, Asian Americans and Spanish-speaking Americans in separate categories in all statistical data that note racial or ethnic heritage. Only in this way can these Americans be assured their rights under federal programs. Finally, in appropriate geographical areas, agencies of the federal government should be equipped to conduct business in such a fashion that Spanish-speaking citizens should not be hampered by language difficulties. Conflict of Interest. The public interest must not be sacrificed to personal gain. Therefore, we call for legislation requiring full disclosure of the financial interests of Members of Congress and their staffs and high officials of the Executive Branch and independent agencies. Disclosure should include business directorships held and associations with individuals or firms lobbying or doing business with the government. Congress should forbid its members to engage in the practice of law or to retain association with a law firm while in office. Legislators serving on a committee whose jurisdiction includes matters in which they have a financial interest should divest themselves of the interest or resign from the committee. Campaign Finance. A total overhaul of the present system of financing elections is a national necessity. Candidates should not be dependent on large contributions who seek preferential treatment. We call for Congressional action to provide for public financing of most election costs by 1974. We recommend a statutory ceiling on political gifts at a reasonable limit. Publicly opined communications facilities such as television, radio and the postal service should be made available, but on a limited basis, to candidates for federal office. Regulation of Lobbyists. We also call upon Congress to enact rigorous lobbying disclosure legislation, to replace the present shockingly ineffective law. There should be full disclosure of all organized lobbying - including names of lobbyists, identity of the source of funds, total receipts and expenditures, the nature of the lobbying operation and specific target issues or bills. Reports should be filed at least quarterly, with criminal penalties for late filing. Lobbying regulations should cover attempts to influence both legislative and Executive Branch decisions. The legislation should specifically cover lobbying appeals in subscription publications. As a safeguard, we urge the availability of subpoena and cease-and-desist powers to enforce these conflict of interest, campaign financing and lobbying disclosure laws. We also affirm the citizens' right to seek enforcement through the courts, should public officials fail in enforcement. Taking Part in the Political Process. The Presidential primary system today is an unacceptable patchwork. The Democratic Party supports federal laws that will embody the following principles:  Protect the opportunity for less-known candidates to build support. Establish uniform ground rules. Reduce the cost of primary campaigns. Promote maximum voter turnout. Ensure that issues are clarified. Foster the selection of nominees with broad popular support to assure the continued viability of the two-party system. Ensure every citizen the ability to take part in the Presidential nomination process, and Equalize the ability of people from all income levels to participate in the political decision-making processes of the Democratic Party, by providing financial assistance through party funds for delegates, alternates and standing committee members to state and national conventions. We also call for full and uniform enforcement of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. But further steps are needed to end all banners to participation in the political process:  Universal voter registration by post card. Bilingual means of registration and voting. Bilingual voter education programs. Liberalized absentee voting. Lower minimum age requirements for service in the Senate and House of Representatives. Minimum residency requirements of 30 days for all elections, including primaries. Student voting where they attend school. Study and review of the Hatch Act, to see what can be done to encourage good citizenship and reasonable participation by government employees. Full home rule for the District of Columbia, including an elected mayor-city council government, broad legislative power, control over appointments, automatic federal payment and voting representation in both Houses of Congress. No discriminatory districting. We favor a Constitutional change to abolish the Electoral College and to give every voter a direct and equal voice in Presidential elections. The amendment should provide for a runoff election, if no candidate received more than 40 percent of the popular vote. Early ratification of the equal rights amendment to the Constitution. Appointment of women to positions of top responsibilities in all branches of the federal government, to achieve an equitable ratio of women and men. Inclusion of women advisers in equitable ratios on all government studies, commissions and hearings, and Laws authorizing federal grants on a matching basis for financing state commissions on the status of women. These changes in themselves will not solve the problems of government for all time. As our society changes, so must the ways we use to make government more responsive to the people. Our challenge, today, as always, is to ensure that politics and institutions belong in spirit and in practice to all the people of our nation. In 1972, Americans are deciding that they want their country back again.",165890,25694,"new directions: '-' skepticism and cynicism are widespread in america. the people are skeptical of platforms filled with political platitudes - of promises made by opportunistic politicians. the people are cynical about the idea that a rosy future is just around the corner. and is it any wonder that the people are skeptical and cynical of the whole political process? our traditions. our history, our constitution, our laws, all say that america belongs to its people. but the people no longer believe it. they feel that the government is run for the privileged few rather than for the many - and they are right. no political party, no president, no government can by itself restore a lost sense of faith. no administration can provide solutions to all our problems. what we can do is to recognize the doubts of americans, to speak to those doubts, and to act to begin turning those doubts into hopes. as democrats, we know that we share responsibility for that loss of confidence. but we also know, as democrats, that at decisive moments of choice in our past, our party has offered leadership that has tapped the best within our country. our party - standing by its ideals of domestic progress and enlightened internationalism - has served america well. we have nominated or elected men of the high calibre of woodrow wilson, franklin delano roosevelt, harry s. truman. adlai e. stevenson, john fitzgerald kennedy, lyndon baines johnson - and in the last election hubert humphrey and edmund s. muskie. in that proud tradition we are now prepared to move forward. we know that our nation cannot tolerate any longer a government that shows no regard for the people's basic needs and no respect for our right to the truth from those who lead us. what do the people want? they want three things: they want a personal life that makes us all feel that life is worth living. they want a social environment whose institutions promote the good of all, and they want a physical environment whose resources are used for the good of all. they want an opportunity to achieve their aspirations and their dreams for themselves and their children. we believe in the rights of citizens to achieve to the limit of their talents and energies. we are determined to remove barriers that limit citizens because they are black, brown, young or women, because they never had the chance to gain an education; because there was no possibility of being anything but what they were. we believe in hard work as a fair measure of our own willingness to achieve. we are determined that millions should not stand idle while work demands to be done. we are determined that the dole should not become a permanent way of life for any. and we are determined that government no longer tax the product of hard work more rigorously than it taxes inherited wealth, or money that is gained simply by having money in the first place. we believe that the law must apply equally to all, and that it must be an instrument of justice. we are determined that the citizen must be protected in his home and on his streets. we are determined also that the ordinary citizen should not be imprisoned for a crime before we know whether he is guilty or not while those with the right friends and the right connections can break the law without ever facing the consequences of their actions. we believe that war is a waste of human life. we are determined to end forthwith a war which has cost , american lives, $ billion of our resources, that has divided us from each other, drained our national will and inflicted incalculable damage to countless people. we will end that war by a simple plan that need not be kept secret: the immediate total withdrawal of all americans from southeast asia. we believe in the right of an individual to speak, think, read, write, worship, and live free of official intrusion. we are determined that our government must no longer tap the phones of law-abiding citizens nor spy on those who have broken no law. we are determined that never again shall government seek to censor the newspapers and television. we are determined that the government shall no longer mock the supreme law of the land, while it stands helpless in the face of crime which makes our neighborhoods and communities less and less safe. perhaps most fundamentally, we believe that government is the servant, not the master, of the people. we are determined that government should not mean a force so huge, so impersonal that the complaint of an ordinary citizen goes unheard. that is not the kind of government america was created to build. our ancestors did not fight a revolution and sacrifice their lives against tyrants from abroad to leave us a government that does not know how to listen to its own people. the democratic party is proud of its past; hut we are honest enough to admit that we are part of the past and share in its mistakes. we want in to begin the long and difficult task of reviewing existing programs, revising them to make them work and finding new techniques to serve the public need. we want to speak for, and with, the citizens of our country. our pledge is to be truthful to the people and to ourselves, to tell you when we succeed, but also when we fail or when we are not sure. in , when this nation celebrates its 200th anniversary, we want to tell you simply that we have done our best to give the government to those who formed it - the people of america. every election is a choice: in , americans must whether they want their country back again. ii. jobs, prices and taxes ""i went to school here and i had some training for truck driver school and i go to different places and put in applications for truck driving but they say, 'we can't hire you without the experience.' now, i don't have the experience. i can't get the experience without the job first. i have four kids, you know, and i'm on unemployment. and when my employment runs out, i'll probably be on relief, like a lot of other people. but, being that i have so many kids, relief is just not going to be enough money. i'm looking for maybe the next year or too, if i don't get a job they'll probably find me down at the county jail, because i have to do something."" - robert coleman, pittsburgh hearing, june , the nixon administration has deliberately driven people out of work in a heartless and ineffective effort to deal with inflation. ending the nixon policy of creating unemployment is the first task of the democratic party. the nixon ""game plan"" called for more unemployment. tens of millions of families have suffered joblessness or cutbacks in the last four years in the name of fighting inflation ... and for nothing. prices rose faster in early than at any time from to . today there are . million unemployed. the nations have suffered $ billion in lost production during the nixon administration by election day. twenty percent of our people have suffered a period without a job each year in the last three. business has lost more in profits than it has gained from his administration s business-oriented tax cuts. in pockets of cities, up to percent of our young people are jobless. farmers have seen the lowest parity ratios since the great depression. for the first time in : years, there is substantial unemployment among aerospace technicians, teachers and other white collar workers. the economic projections have been manipulated for public relations purposes. the current nixon game plan includes a control structure which keeps workers wages down while executive salaries soar, discourages productivity and distributes income away from those who need it and has produced no significant dent in inflation, as prices for food, clothes, rent and basic necessities soar. these losses were unnecessary. they are the price of a republican administration which has no consistent economic philosophy, no adequate regard for the human costs of its economic decisions and no vision of what a full employment economy could mean for all americans. jobs, income and dignity. full employment - a guaranteed job for all - is the primary economic objective of the democratic party. the democratic party is committed to a job for every american who seeks work. only through full employment can we reduce the burden on working people. we are determined to make economic security a matter of right. this means a job with decent pay and good working conditions for everyone willing and able to work and an adequate income for those unable to stork. it means abolition of the present welfare system. to assure jobs and economic security far all, the next democratic administration should support: a full employment economy, making full use of fiscal and monetary policy to stimulate employment. tax reform directed toward equitable distribution of income and wealth and fair sharing of the cost of government. full enforcement of all equal employment opportunity laws, including federal contract compliance and federally regulated industries and giving the equal employment opportunity commission adequate staff and resources and power to issue cease and desist orders promptly. vastly increased efforts to open education at all levels and in all fields to minorities, women and other under-represented groups. an effective nationwide job placement system to enhance worker mobility. opposition to arbitrarily high standards for entry to jobs. overhaul of current manpower programs to assure training - without sex, race or language discrimination - for jobs that really exist with continuous skill improvement and the chance for advancement. economic development programs to ensure the growth of communities and industry in lagging parts of the nation and the economy. use of federal depository funds to reward banks and other financial institutions which invest in socially productive endeavors. improved adjustment assistance and job creation for workers and employers hurt by foreign competition, reconversion of defense-oriented companies, rapid technological change and environmental protection activities. closing tax loopholes that encourage the export of american jobs by american controlled multinational corporations. assurance that the needs of society are considered when a decision to close or move an industrial plant is to be made and that income loss to workers and revenue loss to communities does net occur when plants are closed. assurance that, whatever else is done in the income security area, the social security system provides a decent income for the elderly, the blind and the disabled and their dependents, with escalators so that benefits keep pace with rising prices and living standards. reform of social security and government employment security programs to remove all forms of discrimination by sex, and adequate federal income assistance for those who do not benefit sufficiently from the above measures. the last is not least, but it is last for good reason. the present welfare system has failed because it has been required to make up for too many other failures. millions of americans are forced into public assistance because public policy too often creates no other choice. the heart of a program of economic security based on earned income must be creating jobs and training people to fill them. millions of jobs - real jobs, not make-work - need to be provided. public service employment must be greatly expanded in order to make the government the employer of last resort and guarantee a job for all. large sections of our cities resemble bombed-out europe alter world war ii. children in appalachia cannot go to school when the dirt road is a sea of mud. homes, schools and clinics, roads and mass transit systems need to be built. cleaning up our air and water will take skills and people in large numbers. in the school, the police department, the welfare agency or the recreation program, there are new careers to be developed to help ensure that social services reach the people for whom they are intended. it may cost more, at least initially, to create decent jobs than to perpetuate the hand-out system of present welfare. but the return - in new public facilities and services, in the dignity of bringing a paycheck home and in the taxes that will come back in - far outweigh the cost of the investment. the next democratic administration must end the present welfare system and replace it with an income security program which places cash assistance in an appropriate context with all of the measures outlined above, adding up to an earned income approach to ensure each family an income substantially more than the poverty level ensuring standards of decency and health, as officially defined in the area. federal income assistance will supplement the income of working poor people and assure an adequate income for those unable to work. with full employment and simpler, fair administration, total costs will go down, and with federal financing the burden on local and state budgets will be eased. the program will protect current benefit goals during the transitional period. the system of income protection which replaces welfare must be a part of the full employment policy which assures every american a job at a fair wage under conditions which make use of his ability and provide an opportunity for advancement. hr , and its various amendments, is not humane and does not meet the social and economic objectives that we believe in, and it should be defeated. it perpetuates the coercion of forced work requirements. economic management. every american family knows how its grocery bill has gone up under nixon. every american family has felt the bite of higher and higher prices for food and housing and clothing. the administration attempts to stop price rises have been dismal failures - for which the working people have paid in lost jobs, missed raises and higher prices. this nation achieved its economic greatness under a system of free enterprise, coupled with human effort and ingenuity, and thus it must remain. this will be the attitude and objective of the party. there must be an end to inflation and the ever-increasing cost of living. this is of vital concern to the laborer, the housewife, the farmer and the small businessman, as well as the millions of americans dependent upon their weekly or monthly income for sustenance. it wrecks the retirement plans and lives of our elderly who must survive on pensions or savings gauged by the standards of another day. through greater efficiency in the operation of the machinery of government, so badly plagued with duplication, overlapping and excesses in programs, we will ensure that bureaucracy will cease to exist solely for bureaucracy's own sake. the institutions and functions of government will be judged by their efficiency of operation and their contribution to the lives and welfare of our citizens. a first priority of a democratic administration must he eliminating the unfair, bureaucratic nixon wage and price controls. when price rises threaten to or do get out of control - as they are now - strong, fair action must he taken to protect family income and savings. the theme of that action should he swift, tough measures to break the wage-price spiral and restore the economy. in that kind of economic emergency america's working people will support a truly fair stabilization program which affects profits, investment earnings, executive salaries and prices, as well as wages. the nixon controls do not meet that standard. they have forced the american worker, who suffers most from inflation, to pay the price of trying to end it. in addition to stabilizing the economy we propose: to develop automatic instruments protecting the livelihood of americans who depend on fixed incomes, such as savings bonds with purchasing power guarantees and cost-of-living escalators in government social security and income support payments. to create a system of ""recession insurance"" for states and localities to replace lost local revenues with federal funds in economic downturns, thereby avoiding reduction in public employment or public services. to establish longer-term budget and fiscal planning, and to create new mechanisms to stop unwarranted price increases in concentrated industries. toward economic justice. the democratic party deplores the increasing concentration of economic power in fewer and fewer hands. five percent of the american people control percent of our productive national wealth. less than one percent of all manufacturers have percent of the profits. less than two percent of the population now owns approximately percent of the nation's personally-held corporate stock. percent of the personally-held corporate bonds and nearly percent of the personally-held municipal bonds. the rest of the population - including all working men and women - pay too much for essential products and services because of national policy and market distortions. the democratic administration should pledge itself to combat factors which tend to concentrate wealth and stimulate higher prices. to this end, the federal government should: develop programs to spread economic growth among the workers, farmers and small businessmen. help make parts of the economy more efficient - such as medical care - where wasteful and inefficient practices now increase prices. step up anti-trust action to help competition, with particular regard to laws and enforcement curbing conglomerate mergers which swallow up efficient small business and feed the power of corporate giants. strengthen the anti-trust laws so that the divestiture remedy will he used vigorously to break up large conglomerates found to violate the anti-trust laws. abolish the oil import quota that raises prices for consumers. deconcentrate shared monopolies such as auto, steel and tire industries which administer prices, create unemployment through restricted output and stifle technological innovation. assure the right of the citizen to recover costs and attorney fees in all successful suits including class actions involving constitutionally guaranteed rights. or rights secured by federal statutes. adjust rate-making and regulatory activities, with particular attention to regulations which increase prices for food, transportation and other necessities. remove artificial constraints in the job market by better job manpower training and strictly enforcing equal employment opportunity. stiffen the civil and criminal statutes to make corporate officers responsible for their actions, and establish a temporary national economic commission to study federal chartering of large multinational and international corporations, concentrated ownership and control in the nation's economy. tax reform. the last ten years hare seen a massive shift in the tax burden from the rich to the working people of america. this is due to cuts in federal income taxes simultaneous with big increases in taxes which bear heavily on lower incomes - state and local sales and property taxes and the payroll tax. these federal tax system is also still grossly unfair and over-complicated. the wealthy and corporations get special tax favors; some require major reform of the nation's tax structure - to achieve a more equitable distribution of income and to raise the funds needs by government. the american people neither should nor will accept anything less from the next administration. the nixon administration, which fought serious reform in , has no program, only promises, for tax reform. its clumsy administrative favoring of the well-off has meant quick action on corporate tax giveaways like accelerated depreciation, while over-withholding from workers' paychecks goes on and on while the administration tries to decide what to do. in recent years, the federal tax system has moved precipitously in the wrong direction. corporate taxes have dropped from percent of federal revenues in to percent in , but payroll taxes for social security - regressive because the burden falls more heavily on the worker than on the wealthy have gone from percent to percent over the same period. if legislation now pending in congress passes, payroll taxes will have increased over percent between and - from $ to $ - for the average wage earner. most people earning under $, now pay more in regressive payroll tax than in income tax. now the nixon administration - which gave corporation the largest tax cut in american history - is considering a hidden national sales tax (value added tax) which would further shift the burden to the average wage earner and raise prices of virtually everything ordinary people buy. it is cruel and unnecessary to pretend to relieve one bad tax, the property tax, by a new tax which is just as bad. we oppose this price-raising unfair tax in any form. federal income tax. the democratic party believes that all unfair corporate and individual tax preferences should be removed the tax law is clogged with complicated provisions and special interests, such as percentage oil depletion and other favors for the oil industry, special rates and rules for capital gains, fast depreciation unrelated to useful life, easy-to-abuse ""expense-account"" deductions and the ineffective minimum tax. these hidden expenditures in the federal budget are nothing more than billions of ""tax welfare"" aid for the wealthy, the privileged and the corporations. we, therefore, endorse as a minimum step the mills-mansfield tax policy review act of , which would repeal virtual all tax preferences in the existing law over the period - , as a means of compelling a systematic review of their value to the nation. we acknowledge that the original reasons for some of these tax preferences may remain valid, but believe that none should escape close scrutiny and full public exposure. the most unjustified one of the tax loopholes should, however, be closed immediately, without waiting for a review of the whole system. after the implementation of the minimum provisions of the mills-mansfield act, the democratic party, to combat the economically-depressing effect of a regressive income tax scheme, proposes further revision of the tax law to ensure economy equality of opportunity to ordinary americans. we hold that the federal tax structure should reflect following principles: the cost of government must be distributed more fairly among income classes. we reaffirm the long-established principle of progressive taxation - allocating the burden according to ability to pay - which is all but a dead letter in the presently code. the cost of government must be distributed fairly among citizens in similar economic circumstances. direct expenditures by the federal government which can be budgeted are better than tax preferences as the means for achieving public objectives. the lost income of those tax preferences which are deemed desirable should be stated in the annual budget. when relief for hardship is provided through federal tax policy, as for blindness, old age or poverty, benefits should be provided equally by credit rather than deductions which favor recipients with more income, with special provisions for those whose credits would exceed the tax they owe. provisions which discriminate against working women and single people should be corrected. in addition to greater fairness and efficiency these principles would mean a major redistribution of personal tax burdens and permit considerable simplification of the tax code and tax forms. social security tax. the democratic party commits itself to make the social security tax progressive by raising substantially the ceiling on earned income. to permit needed increases in social security benefits, we will use general revenues as necessary to supplement payroll tax receipts. in this way, we will support continued movement toward general revenue financing for social security. property tax. greater fairness in taxation at the federal level will have little meaning for the vast majority of american households if the burden of inequitable local taxation is not reduced. to reduce the local property tax for all american families, we support equalization of school spending and substantial increases in the federal share of education costs and general revenue sharing. new terms of federal financial assistance to states and localities should be made contingent upon property tax reforms, including equal treatment and full publication of assessment ratios. tax policy should not provide incentives that encourage over-investment in developed countries by american business, and mechanisms should be instituted to limit undesirable capital exports that exploit labor abroad and damage the american worker at home. labor-management relations. free private collective bargaining between management and independent labor unions has been, and must remain, the cornerstone of our free enterprise system. america achieved its greatness through the combined energy and efforts of the working men and women of this country. retention of its greatness rests in their hands. through their great trade union organizations, these men and women have exerted tremendous influence on the economic and social life of the nation and have attained a standard of living known to no other nation. the concern of the party is that the gains which labor struggled so long to obtain not be lost to them, whether through inaction or subservience to illogical republican domestic policies. we pledge continued support for our system of free collective bargaining and denounce any attempt to substitute compulsory arbitration for it. we, therefore, oppose the nixon administration's effort to impose arbitration in transportation disputes through its last-offer-selection bill. the national labor relations act should be updated to ensure: extension of protection to employees of non-profit institutions. remedies which adequately reflect the losses caused by violations of the act. repeal of section (b), which allows states to legislate the open shop and remove the ban on common-sites picketing, and effective opportunities for unions, as well as employers, to communicate with employees, without coercion by either side or by anyone acting on their behalf. the railway labor act should be updated to ensure: that strikes on a single carrier or group of carriers cannot be transformed into nation-wide strikes or lockouts. incentives for bargaining which would enable both management and labor to resolve their differences without referring to government intervention, and partial operation of struck railroads to ensure continued movement of essential commodities. new legislation is needed to ensure: collective bargaining rights for government employees. universal coverage and longer duration of the unemployment insurance and workmen's compensation programs and to establish minimum federal standards, including the establishment of equitable wage-loss ratios in those programs, including a built-in escalator clause that fairly reflects increases in average wage rates, and that workers covered under private pension plans actually receive the personal and other fringe benefits to which their services for their employer entitle them. this requires that the fixed right to benefits starts early in employment, that reserves move with the worker from job to job and that re-insurance protection be given pension plans. labor standards. american workers are entitled to job safety at a living wage. most of the basic protections needed have been recognized in legislation already enacted by congress. the fair labor standards act should be updated, however, to: move to a minimum wage of $. per hour, which allows a wage earner to earn more than a poverty level income for hours a week, with no subminimums for special groups or age differentials. expand coverage to include the million workers not presently covered, including domestic workers, service workers, agricultural employees and employees of governmental and nonprofit agencies, and set overtime premiums which give an incentive to hire new employees rather than to use regular employees for extended periods of overtime. the longshoremen and harbor workers' compensation act should be updated to provide adequate protection for injured workers and federal standards for workmen's compensation should be set by congress. the equal pay act of should be extended to be fully effective, and to cover professional, executive and administrative workers. maternity benefits should be made available to all working women. temporary disability benefits should cover pregnancy, childbirth, miscarriage and recovery. occupational health and safety. each year over , american workers are killed on their jobs, and nine million injured. unknown millions more are exposed to long-term danger and disease from exposure to dangerous substances. federal and state laws are supposed to protect workers; but these laws are not being enforced. this administration has hired only a handful of inspectors and proposes to turn enforcement over to the same state bureaucracies that have proven inadequate in the past. where violations are detected, only token penalties have been assessed. we pledge to fully and rigorously enforce the laws which protect the safety and health of workers on their jobs and to extend those laws to all jobs, regardless of number of employees. this must include standards that truly protect against all health hazards, adequate federal enforcement machinery backed up by rigorous penalties and an opportunity for workers themselves to participate in the laws' enforcement by sharing responsibility for plant inspection. we endorse federal research and development of effective approaches to combat the dehumanizing and debilitating effects of monotonous work. farm labor. the sixties and seventies have seen the struggle for unionization by the poorest of the poor in our country - america's migrant farm workers. under the leadership of cesar chavez, the united farm workers have accomplished in the non-violent tradition what was thought impossible only a short time ago. through hard work and much sacrifice, they are the one group that is successfully organizing farm workers. their movement has caught the imagination of millions of americans who have not eaten grapes so that agribusiness employers will recognize their workers as equals and sit down with them in meaningful collective bargaining. we now call upon all friends and supporters of this movement to refrain from buying or eating non-union lettuce. furthermore, we support the farm workers' movement and the use of boycotts as a non-violent and potent weapon for gaining collective bargaining recognition and contracts for agricultural workers. we oppose the nixon administration's effort to enjoin the use of the boycott. we also affirm the right of farm workers to organize free of repressive anti-labor legislation, both state and federal. iii. rights, power and social justice ""we're just asking, and we don't ask for much. just to give us the opportunity to live as human beings as other people have lived."" - dorothy bolden, atlanta hearing, june , ""all your platform has to say is that the rights, opportunities and political power of citizenship will be extended to the lowest level, to neighborhoods and individuals. if your party can live up to that simple pledge, my faith will be restored."" - bobby westbrooks, st. louis hearing, june , ""we therefore urge the democratic party to adopt the principle that america has a responsibility to offer every american family the best in health care, whenever they need it, regardless of income or any other factor. we must devise a system which will assure that ... every american receives comprehensive health services from the day he is born until the day he dies, with an emphasis on preventive care to keep him healthy .... "" - senator edward m. kennedy, st. louis hearing, june , the democratic party commits itself to be responsive to the millions of hard working, lower- and middle-income americans who are traditionally courted by politicians at election time, get bilked at tax-paying time, and are too often forgotten the balance of the time. this is an era of great change. the world is fast moving into a future for which the past has not prepared us well; a future where to survive, to find answers to the problems which threaten us as a people. we must create qualitatively new solutions. we can no longer rely on old systems of thought, the results of which were partially successful programs that were heralded as important social reforms in the past. it is time now to rethink and reorder the institutions of this country so that everyone - women, blacks, spanish-speaking, puerto ricans, indians, the young and the old - can participate in the decision-making process inherent in the democratic heritage to which we aspire. we must restructure the social, political and economic relationships throughout the entire society in order to ensure the equitable distribution of wealth and power. the democratic party in is committed to resuming the march toward equality; to enforcing the laws supporting court decisions and enacting new legal rights as necessary, to assuring every american true opportunity, to bringing about a more equal distribution of power, income and wealth and equal and uniform enforcement in all states and territories of civil rights statutes and acts. in the 's, this commitment requires the fulfillment - through laws and policies, through appropriations and directives, through leadership and exhortation - of a wide variety of rights: the right to full participation in government and the political process. the rights of free speech and free political expression, of freedom from official intimidation, harassment and invasion of privacy, as guaranteed by the letter and the spirit of the constitution. the right to a decent job and an adequate income with dignity. the right to quality, accessibility and sufficient quantity of tax-supported services and amenities - including educational opportunity, health care, housing and transportation. the right to quality, safety and the lowest possible cost on goods and services purchased in the market place. the right to be different, to maintain a cultural or ethnic heritage of lifestyle, without being forced into a compelled homogeneity. the rights of people who lack rights: children, the mentally retarded, mentally ill and prisoners, to name some, and the right to legal services, both civil and criminal, necessary to enforce secured rights. free expression and privacy. the new democratic administration should bring an end to the pattern of political persecution and investigation, the use of high office as a pulpit for unfair attack and intimidation and the blatant efforts to control the poor and to keep them from acquiring additional economic security or political power. the epidemic of wiretapping and electronic surveillance engaged in by the nixon administration and the use of grand juries for purposes of political intimidation must be ended. the rule of law and the supremacy of the constitution, as these concepts have traditionally been understood, must be restored. we strongly object to secret computer data banks on individuals. citizens should have access to their own files that are maintained by private commercial firms and the right to insert corrective material. except in limited cases, the same should apply to government files. collection and maintenance by federal agencies of dossiers on law-abiding citizens, because of their political views and statements, must be stopped, and files which never should have been opened should be destroyed. we firmly reject the idea of a national computer data bank. the nixon policy of intimidation of the media and administration efforts to use government power to block access to media by dissenters must end, if free speech is to be preserved. a democratic administration must be an open one, with the fullest possible disclosure of information, with an end to abuses of security classifications and executive privilege, and with a regular top-level press conferences. the right to be different. the new democratic administration can help lead america to celebrate the magnificence of the diversity within its population, the racial, national, linguistic and religious groups which have contributed so much to the vitality and richness of our national life. as thinks are, official policy too often forces people into a mold of artificial homogeneity. recognition and support of the cultural identity and pride of black people are generations overdue. the american indians, the spanish-speaking, the asian americans - the cultural and linguistic heritage of these groups is too often ignored in schools and communities. so, too, are the backgrounds, traditions and contributions of white national, ethnic, religious and regional communities ignored. all official discrimination on the basis of sex, age, race, language, political belief, religion, region or national origin must end. no american should be subject to discrimination in employment or restriction in business because of ethnic background or religious practice. americans should be free to make their own choice of lifestyles and private habits without being subject to discrimination or prosecution. we believe official policy can encourage diversity while continuing to place full emphasis on equal opportunity and integration. we urge full funding of the ethnic studies bill to provide funds for development of curriculum to preserve america's ethnic mosaic. rights of children. one measure of a nation's greatness is the care it manifests for all of its children. the nixon administration has demonstrated a callous attitude toward children repeatedly through veto and administrative decisions. we, therefore, call for a reordering of priorities at all levels of american society so that children, our most precious resource, and families come first. to that end, we call for: the federal government to fund comprehensive developmental child care programs that will be family centered, locally controlled and universally available. these programs should provide for active participation of all family members in the development and implementation of the program. health, social service and early childhood education should he part of these programs, as well as a variety of options most appropriate to their needs. child care is a supplement not a substitute, for the family. the establishment of a strong child advocacy program, financed by the federal government and other sources, with full ethnic, cultural, racial and sexual representation first priority for the needs of children, as we move toward a national health insurance program. the first step should be immediate implementation of the federal law passed in the social security amendments providing for ""early and periodic screening, diagnosis and treatment"" of children's health problems. legislation and administrative decisions to drastically reduce childhood injuries - prenatal, traffic, poisoning, burns, malnutrition, rat bites and to provide health and safety education. full funding of legislation designed to meet the needs of children with special needs: the retarded, the physically and mentally handicapped, and those whose environment produces abuse and neglect and directs the child to anti-social conduct. reaffirmation of the rights of bilingual, handicapped or slow-learning children to education in the public schools, instead of being wrongly classified as retarded or uneducable and dismissed. revision of the juvenile court system; dependency and neglect cases must be removed from the corrections system, and clear distinctions must he drawn between petty childhood offenses and the more serious crimes. allocation of funds to the states to provide counsel to children in juvenile proceedings, legal or administrative, and creation by congress of permanent standing committees on children and youth. rights of women. women historically have been denied a full voice in the evolution of the political and social institutions of this country and are therefore allied with all underrepresented groups in a common desire to form a more humane and compassionate society. the democratic party pledges the following: a priority effort to ratify the equal rights amendment. elimination of discrimination against women in public accommodations and public facilities, public education and in all federally-assisted programs and federally-contracted employment. extension of the jurisdiction of the civil rights commission to include denial of civil rights on the basis of sex full enforcement of all federal statutes and executive laws barring job discrimination on the basis of sex, giving the equal employment opportunities commission adequate staff and resources and power to issue cease-and-desist orders promptly. elimination of discriminatory features of criminal laws and administration. increased efforts to open educational opportunities at all levels, eliminating discrimination against women in access to education, tenure, promotion and salary. guarantee that all training programs are made more equitable, both in terms of the numbers of women involved and the job opportunities provided; jobs must be available on the basis of skill, not sex. availability of maternity benefits to all working women; temporary disability benefits should cover pregnancy, childbirth miscarriage and recovery. elimination of all tax inequities that affect women and children, such as higher taxes for single women. amendment of the social security act to provide equitable retirement benefits for families with working wives, widows women heads of households and their children. amendment of the internal revenue code to permit working families to deduct from gross income as a business expense, housekeeping and child care costs. equality for women on credit, mortgage, insurance, property, rental and finance contracts. extension of the equal pay act to all workers, with amendment to read ""equal pay for comparable work."" appointment of women to positions of top responsibility in all branches of the federal government to achieve an equitable ratio of women and men. such positions include cabinet members, agency and division heads and supreme court justices; inclusion of women advisors in equitable ratios on all government studies, commissions and hearings, and laws authorizing federal grants on a matching basis for financing state commissions of the status of women. rights of youth. in order to ensure, maintain and secure the proper role and functions of youth in american government, politics and society, the democratic party will endeavor to: lower the age of legal majority and consent to . actively encourage and assist in the election of youth to federal, state and local offices. develop special programs for employment of youth, utilizing governmental resources to guarantee development, training and job placement, and secure the electoral reforms called for under ""people and the government."" rights of poor people. poor people, like all americans should be represented at all levels of the democratic party in reasonable proportion to their numbers in the general population. affirmative action must be taken to ensure their representation at every level. the democratic party guidelines guaranteeing proportional representation to ""previously discriminated against groups"" (enumerated as 'women, young people and minorities') must be extended to specifically include poor people. political parties, candidates and government institutions at all levels must be committed to working with and supporting poor people's organizations and ending the tokenism and cooptation that has characterized past dealings. welfare rights organizations must be recognized as representative of welfare recipients and be given access to regulations, policies and decision-making processes, as well as being allowed to represent clients at all governmental levels. the federal government must protect the right of tenants to organize tenant organizations and negotiate collective bargaining agreements with private landlords and encourage the participation of the tenants in the management and control of all subsidized housing. rights of american indians. we support rights of american indians to full rights of citizenship. the federal government should commit all necessary funds to improve the lives of indians, with no division between reservation and non-reservation indians. we strongly oppose the policy of termination, and we urge the government to provide unequivocal advocacy for the protection of the remaining indian land and water resources. all land rights due american indians, and americans of spanish and mexican descent, on the basis of treaties with the federal government will be protected by the federal government. american indians should be given the right to receive bilingual medical services from hospitals and physicians of their choice. rights of the physically disabled. the physically disabled have the right to pursue meaningful employment and education, outside a hospital environment, free from unnecessary discriminations living in adequate housing, with access to public mass transportation and regular medical care. equal opportunity employment practices should he used by the government in considering their application for federal jobs and equal access to education from pre-school to the college level guaranteed. the physically disabled, like all disadvantaged peoples, should he represented in any group making decisions affecting their lives. rights of the mentally retarded. the mentally retarded must he given employment and educational opportunities that promote their dignity as individuals and ensure their civil rights. educational and treatment facilities must guarantee that these rights always will he recognized and protected. in addition. to assure these citizens a more meaningful life, emphasis must he placed on programs of treatment that respect their right to life in a non-institutional environment. rights of the elderly. growing old in america for too many means neglect, sickness, despair and, all too often, poverty. we have tailed to discharge the basic obligation of a civilized people - to respect and assure the security of our senior citizens. the democratic party pledges, as a final step to economic security for all, to end poverty - as measured by official standards - among the retired, the blind and the disabled. our general program of economic and social justice will benefit the elderly directly. in addition, a democratic administration should: increase social security to bring benefits into line with changes on the national standard of living. provide automatic adjustments to assure that benefits keep pace with inflation. support legislation which allows beneficiaries to earn more income, without reduction of social security payments. protect individuals pension rights by pension re-insurance and early vesting. lower retirement eligibility age to in all government pension programs. expand housing assistance for the elderly. encourage development of local programs by which senior citizens can serve their community in providing education, recreation. counseling and other services to the rest of the population. establish federal standards and inspection of nursing homes and full federal support for qualified nursing homes. take the needs of the elderly and the handicapped into account in all federal programs, including construction of federal buildings, housing and transportation planning. pending a full national health security system, expand medicare by supplementing trust funds with general revenues in order to provide a complete range of care and services; eliminate the nixon administration cutbacks in medicare and medicaid; eliminate the part b premium under medicare and include under medicare and medicaid the costs of eyeglasses, denture, hearing aids, and all prescription drugs and establish uniform national standards for medicaid to bring to an end to the present situation which makes it worse to be poor in one state than in another. the democratic party pledges itself to adopt rules to give those over years old representation on all party committees and agencies as nearly as possible in proportion to their percentage in the total population. rights of veterans. it is time that the nation did far more to recognize the service of our million living veterans and to serve them in return. the veterans of vietnam must get special attention, for no end of the war is truly honorable which does not provide these men the opportunities to meet their needs. the democratic party is committed to extending and improving the benefits available to american veterans and society, to ending the neglect shown by the nixon administration to these problems and to the human needs of our ex-servicemen. medical care. the federal government must guarantee quality medical care to ex-servicemen, and to all disabled veterans, expanding and improving veterans administration facilities and manpower and preserve the independence and integrity of the va hospital program. staff-patient ratios in these hospitals should he made comparable to ratios in community hospitals. meanwhile, there should be an increase in the va's ability to deliver out-patient care and home health services, wherever possible treating veterans as part of a family unit. we support future integration of health care for veterans into the national health care insurance program, with no reduction in scale or quality of existing veterans care and with recognition of the special health needs of veterans. the va separate personnel system should be expanded to take in all types of health personnel, and especially physician's assistants; and va hospitals should be used to develop state medical schools and area health education centers. the va should also assume responsibility for the care of wives and children of veterans who are either permanently disabled or who have died from service-connected causes. distinction should no longer be made between veterans who have seen ""wartime,"" as opposed to ""peacetime,"" service. education. educational benefits should be provided for vietnam-era veterans under the gi bill at levels comparable to those of the original bill after world war ii, supplemented by special veteran's education loans. the va should greatly expand improve programs for poor or educationally disadvantaged veterans. in addition, there should be a program under which servicemen and women can receive high school, college or job training while on active duty. gi bill trainees should be used more extensively to reach out to other veterans who would otherwise miss these educational opportunities. drug addiction. the veterans administration should provide either directly or through community facilities a comprehensive, individually tailored treatment and rehabilitation program for all drug- and alcohol-addicted veterans, on a voluntary and confidential basis, and regardless of the nature of their discharge or the way in which they acquired their condition. unemployment. there should be an increase in unemployment compensation provided to veterans, and much greater emphasis on the veterans employment service of the department of labor, expanding its activities in every state. there should be a greatly enlarged effort by the federal government to employ vietnam-era veterans and other veterans with service-connected disabilities. in addition, veterans' preferences in hiring should be written into every federal contract or subcontract and for public service employment. rights of servicemen and servicewomen. military discipline must be maintained, but unjustifiable restriction on the constitutional rights of members of the armed service must cease. we support means to ensure the protection of gi rights or express political opinion and engage in off-base political activity. we should explore new procedures for providing review of discharges other than honorable, in cases involving political activity. we oppose deferential advancement, punishment assignment or any other treatment on the basis of race, and support affirmative action to end discrimination. we support rights of women in the armed forces to be free from unfair discrimination. we support an amendment of the uniform code of military justice to provide for fair and uniform sentencing procedures. rights of consumers. consumers need to be assured of a renewed commitment to basic rights and freedoms. they must have the mechanisms available to allow self-protection against the abuses that the kennedy and johnson programs we designed to eliminate. we propose a new consumer program: in the executive branch. the executive branch must use its power to expand consumer information and protection: ensure that every policy-making level of government concerned with economic or procurement decisions should have a consumer input either through a consumer advisory committee or through consumer members on policy advisory committees. support the development of an independent consumer agency providing a focal point on consumer matters with the right to intervene as amicus curiae on behalf of the consumer before all agencies and regulatory bodies, and expand all economic policy-making mechanisms to include an assessment of social as well as economic indicators of human well-being. in the legislative branch. we support legislation which will expand the ability of consumers to defend themselves: ensure an extensive campaign to get food, drugs and all other consumer products to carry complete informative labeling about safety, quality and cost. such labeling is the first step in ensuring the economic and physical health of the consumer. in the food area, it should include nutritional unit pricing, full ingredients by percentage, grade, quality and drained weight information. for drugs, it should include safety, quality, price and operation data, either on the label or in an enclosed manual. support a national program to encourage the development of consumer cooperatives patterned after the rural electric cooperatives in areas where they might help eliminate inflation and restore consumer rights, and support federal initiatives and federal standards to reform automobile insurance and assure coverage as first part, on a no-fault basis. in the judicial branch. the courts should become an effective forum to hear well-founded consumer grievances. consumer class action: consumers should he given access to the federal courts in a way that allows them to initiate group action against fraudulent, deceitful, or misleading or dangerous business practices. small claims court: a national program should he undertaken to improve the workings of small claims courts and spread their use so that consumers injured in economically small, though individually significant amounts (e.g. $), can bring their complaints to the attention of a court and collect their damages without self-defeating legal fees. the quality and quantity of social service. the new democratic administration can begin a fundamental re-examination of all federal domestic social programs and the patterns of service delivery they support. simply advocating the expenditure of more funds is not enough, although funds are needed, for billions already have been poured into federal government programs like urban renewal, current welfare and aid to education, with meager results. the control, structure and effectiveness of every institution and government grant system must be fully examined and these institutions must be made accountable to those they are supposed to serve. we will, therefore pursue the development of new rights at two kinds: rights to the service itself and rights to participate in the delivery process. health care, good health is the least this society should promise its citizens. the state of health services in this country indicates the failure of government to respond to this fundamental need. costs skyrocket while the availability of services for all but the rich steadily decline. we endorse the principle that good health is a right of all americans. america has a responsibility to offer to every american family the best in health care wherever they need it, regardless of income or where they live or any other factor. to achieve this goal the next democratic administration should: establish a system of universal national health insurance which covers all americans with a comprehensive set of benefits including preventive medicine, mental and emotional disorders, and complete protection against catastrophic costs, and in which the rule of free choice for both provider and consumer is protected. the program should he federally-financed and federally-administered. every american must know he can afford the cost of health care whether given in a hospital or a doctor's office. incorporate in the national health insurance system incentives and controls to curb inflation in health care costs and to assure efficient delivery of all services. continue and evaluate health maintenance organizations. set up incentives to bring health service personnel back to inner-cities and rural areas. continue to expand community health centers and availability of early screening diagnosis and treatment. provide federal funds to train added health manpower including doctors, nurses, technicians and para-medical workers. secure greater consumer participation and control over health care institutions. expand federal support for medical research including research in heart disease, hypertension, stroke, cancer, sickle cell anemia, occupational and childhood diseases which threaten millions and in preventive health care. eventual replacement of all federal programs of health care by a comprehensive national health insurance system. take legal and other action to curb soaring prices for vital drugs using anti-trust laws as applicable and amending patent laws to end price-raising abuses, and require generic-name labeling of equal-effective drugs, and expand federal research and support for drug abuse treatment and education. especially development of non-addictive treatment methods. family planning. family planning services, including the education, comprehensive medical and social services necessary to permit individuals freely to determine and achieve the number and spacing of their children, should be available to all, regardless of sex, age, marital status, economic croup or ethnic origin, and should be administered in a non-coercive and nondiscriminatory manner. puerto rico. the democratic party respects and supports the frequently-expressed desire of the people of puerto rico to freely associate in permanent union with the united states, as an autonomous commonwealth. we are committed to puerto rico's right to enjoy full self-determination and a relationship that can evolve in ways that will most benefit both parties. to this end, we support equal treatment for puerto rico in the distribution of all federal grants-in-aid, amendment of federal laws that restrict aid to puerto rico; and we pledge no further restrictions in future laws. only in this way can the people of puerto rico come to participate more fully in the many areas of social progress made possible by democratic efforts, on behalf of all the people. finally, the democratic party pledges to end all naval shelling and bombardment of the tiny, inhabited island of culebra and its neighboring keys, no later than june , . with this action, and others, we will demonstrate the concern of the democratic party to develop and maintain a productive relationship between the commonwealth and the united states. virgin islands, guam, american samoa and the trust territories of the pacific. we pledge to include all of these areas in federal grant-in-aid programs on a full and equitable basis. we praise the democratic congress for providing a non-voting delegate to the house of representatives from guam and the virgin islands and urge that these elected delegates be accorded the full vote in the committees to which they are assigned. we support the right of american samoans to elect their governor, and will consider methods by which american citizens residing in american territories can participate in presidential elections. iv. cities, communities, counties and the environment ""when the democratic platform is written and acted on in miami, let it be a blueprint for the life and survival of our cities and our people. ""- mayor kenneth a. gibson, mayors' conference, new orleans, june , introduction. always the vital center of our civilization, the american city since world war ii has been suffering growing pains, caused partly by the change of the core city into a metropolitan city and partly by the movement of people from towns and rural areas into the cities. the burgeoning of the suburbs - thrust outward with too little concern for social. economic and environmental consequences - has both broadened the city's limits and deepened human and neighborhood needs. the nixon administration has failed to meet most of these needs. it has met the problem of urban decay with tired, decaying ""solutions"" that are unworthy of the name. it could act to revitalize our urban areas; instead, we see only rising crime, fear and flight, racial and economic polarization, loss of confidence and depletion of community resources. this administration has ignored the cities and suburbs, permitting taxes to rise and services to decline; housing to deteriorate faster than it can be replaced, and morale to suffer. it actually has impounded funds appropriated by a democratic congress to help cities in crisis. the administration has ignored the needs of city and suburban residents for public services, for property tax relief and for the planning and coordination that alone can assure that housing, jobs, schools and transportation are built and maintained in suitable locations and in needed numbers and quality. meanwhile, the nixon administration has forgotten smalltown america too, refusing to provide facilities that would make it an attractive alternative to city living. this has become the american crisis of the 's. today, our highest national priority is clear and precise: to deal effectively - and now - with the massive, complex and urgent needs of our cities, suburbs and towns. the federal government cannot solve all the problems of these communities. too often, federal bureaucracy has failed to deliver the services and keep the promises that are made. but only the federal government can be the catalyst to focus attention and resources on the needs of every neighborhood in america. under the nixon administration, piecemeal measures, poorly funded and haphazardly applied, have proved almost totally inadequate. words have not halted the decline of neighborhoods. words have not relieved the plight of tenants in poorly managed, shoddy housing. our scarce urban dollars have been wasted, and even the republican secretary of housing and urban development has admitted it. the democratic party pledges to stop the rot in our cities, suburbs and towns. and stop it now. we pledge commitment, coordination. planning and funds: commitment to make our communities places where we are proud to raise our children. coordination and planning to help all levels of government achieve the same goals, to ensure that physical facilities meet human needs and to ensure that land - a scarce resource - is used in ways that meet the needs of the entire nation, and funds to reduce the burden of the inequitable property tax and to help local government meet legitimate and growing demands for public facilities and services. the nation's urban areas must and can be habitable. they are not only centers of commerce and trade, but also repositories of history and culture, expressing the richness and variety of their region and of the larger society. they are worthy of the best america can otter. they are america. partnership among governments. the federal government must assist local communities to plan for their growth and development, to improve conditions and opportunities for all their citizens and to build the public facilities they need. effective planning must be done on a regional basis. new means of planning are needed that are practical and realistic, but that go beyond the limits of jurisdictional lines. if local government is to be responsive to citizen needs, public services and programs must efficiently be coordinated and evolved through comprehensive regional planning and decision-making. government activities should take account of the future as well as the present. in aiding the reform of state and local government, federal authority must insist that local decisions take into account the views and needs of all citizens, white and black, haves and have-nots, young and old, spanish and other non-english-speaking, urban, suburban and rural. americans ask more and more of their local government but the regressive property tax structure makes it impossible for cities and counties to deliver. the democratic party is: committed to ensure that state and local governments have the funds and the capacity to achieve community service and development goals - goals that are nationally recognized. to this end: we fully support general revenue sharing and the principle that the federal income tax should be used to raise more revenues for local use. we pledge adequate federal funds to halt property increases and to begin to roll them back. turning over federal funds to local governments will permit salaries of underpaid state and local government employees to climb to acceptable levels; and it will reduce tax pressures on the aged, the poor, spanish and other non-english-speaking americans and young couples starting out in life. we further commit ourselves to reorganize categorical grant programs. they should be consolidated, expanded and simplified. funding should be adequate, dependable, sustained, long-term and related to state and local fiscal timetables and priorities. there should be full funding of all programs, without the impounding of funds by the executive branch to thwart the will of congress. and there should be performance standards governing the distribution of all federal funds to state and local governments, and we support efforts to eliminate gaps and costly overlaps in services delivered by different levels of government. urban growth policy. the nixon administrations has neither developed an effective urban growth policy designed to meet critical problems, nor concerned itself with the needed recreation of the quality of life in our cities, large and small. instead, it has severely over-administered and underfunded existing federal aid programs. through word and deed, the administration has widened the gulf between city and suburb, between core and fringe, between haves and have-nots. the nation's urban growth policies are seen most clearly in the legitimate complaints of suburban householders over rising taxes and of center-city families over houses that are falling apart and services that are often non-existent. and it is here, in the center city, that the failure of nixon administration policies is most clear to all who live there. the democratic party pledges: a national urban growth policy to promote a balance of population among cities, suburbs, small towns and rural areas, while providing social and economic opportunities for everyone. america needs a logical urban growth policy, instead of today's inadvertent, chaotic and haphazard one that doesn't work. an urban growth policy that truly deals with our tax and mortgage insurance and highway policies will require the use of federal policies as leverage on private investment. a policy on housing - including low- and middle-income housing - that will concentrate effort in areas where there are jobs, transportation, schools, health care and commercial facilities. problems of over-growth are not caused so much by land scarcity as by the wrong distribution of people and the inadequate servicing of their needs, and a policy to experiment with alternative strategies to reserve land for future development - land banks - and a policy to recoup publicly created land values for public benefit. the cities. many of the worst problems in america are centered in our cities. countless problems contribute to their plight: decay in housing, the drain of welfare, crime and violence, racism, failing schools. joblessness and poor mass transit, lack of planning for land use and services. the democratic party pledges itself to change the disastrous policies of the nixon administration toward the cities and to reverse the steady process of decay and dissolution. we will renew the battle begun under the kennedy and johnson administrations to improve the quality of life in our cities. in addition to pledging the resources critically needed, we commit ourselves to these actions: help localities to develop their own solutions to their most pressing problems - the federal government should not stifle or usurp local initiative. carry out programs developed elsewhere in this platform to assure every american decent shelter, freedom from hunger, good health care, the opportunity to work, adequate income and a decent education. provide sufficient management and planning funds for cities, to let them increase staff capacity and improve means of allocating resources. distribute funds according to standards that will provide center cities with enough resources to revitalize old neighborhoods and build new ones, to expand and improve community vertices and to help local governments better to plan and deliver these services, and create and fund a housing strategy that will recognize that housing is neighborhood and community as well as shelter - a strategy that will serve all the nation's urban areas and all the american people. housing and community development. the housing act pledged ""a decent home and suitable living environment for every american family."" twenty-three years later, this goal is still far away. under this administration, there simply has been no progress in meeting our housing needs, despite the democratic housing act at . we must build . million homes a year, including two-thirds of a million units of federally subsidized low- and middle-income housing. these targets are not being met. and the lack of housing is particularly critical for people with low and middle incomes. in the cities, widespread deterioration and abandonment are destroying once sound homes and apartments, and often entire neighborhoods, faster than new homes are built. federal housing policy creates walled compounds of poor, elderly and ethnic minorities, isolating them in the center city. these harmful policies include the administration's approach to urban renewal discrimination against the center city by the federal housing administration, highway policies that destroy neighborhoods and create ghettoes and other practices that work against housing for low and middle-income families. millions of lower- and middle-class americans - each year the income level is higher - are priced out of housing because of sharply rising costs. under republican leadership, the federal housing administration (fha) has become the biggest slumlord in the country. some unsophisticated home buyers have purchased homes with fha mortgage insurance or subsidies. these consumers, relying on fha appraisals to protect them, often haze been exploited by real estate speculators and dishonest builders. unable to repair or maintain these houses, the buyers often have no choice but to abandon them. as a result, the fha will acquire a quarter million of these abandoned houses at a cost to the taxpayers of billions of dollars. under the republican administration, the emphasis has been on housing subsidies for the people who build and sell houses rather than for those people who need and live in them. in many cases, the only decent shelter provided is a tax shelter. to correct this inequity the democratic party pledges: to overhaul completely the fha to make it a consumer-oriented agency. to use the full faith and credit of the treasury to provide direct, low-interest loans to finance the construction and purchase of decent housing for the american people, and to insist on building practices, inspection standards and management that will assure quality housing. the next administration must build and conserve housing that not only meets the basic need for shelter, but also provides a wider choice of quality housing and living environments. to meet this challenger the democratic party commits itself to a housing approach that: prevents the decay and abandonment of homes and neighborhoods. major rehabilitation programs to conserve and rehabilitate housing are needed. consumers should be aided in purchasing homes, and low-income housing foreclosed by the fha should he provided to poor families at minimal cost as an urban land grant. these houses should be rehabilitated and lived in, not left to rot. provides federal funds for preservation of existing neighborhoods. local communities should decide whether they want renewal or preservation. choosing preservation should not mean steady deterioration and inadequate facilities. provides for improved housing quality for all families through strict enforcement of housing quality standards and full compliance with state and local health and safety laws. provides effective incentives to reduce housing costs - to the benefit of poor and middle-income families alike through effective use of unused, undeveloped land, reform of building practices and the use of new building techniques, including factorymade and modular construction. assures that residents have a strong voice in determining the destiny of their own neighborhoods. promotes free choice in housing - the right of all families, regardless of race, color, religion or income, to choose among a wide range of homes and neighborhoods in urban, suburban and rural areas - through the greater use of grants to individuals for housing, the development of new communities offering diversified housing and neighborhood options and the enforcement of fair housing laws, and assures fair and equitable relationships between landlords and tenants. new towns. new towns meet the direct housing and community needs of only a small part of our population. to do more, new towns must be developed in concert with massive efforts to revitalize central cities and enhance the quality of life in still growing suburban areas. the democratic party pledges: to strengthen the administration of the new towns program; to reduce onerous review requirements that delay the start of new towns and thus thwart congressional mandates; to release already appropriated monies and provide new planning and development funds needed to assure the quality of life in new towns; and to assure coordination between development of new towns and renewed efforts to improve the quality of life in established urban and suburban areas. we also promise to use effectively the development of new towns to increase housing choices for people now living in central and suburban areas. transportation. urban problems cannot be separated from transportation problems. whether tying communities together, connecting one community to another or linking our cities and towns to rural areas, good transportation is essential to the social and economic life of any community. it joins workers to jobs, makes commercial activity both possible and profitable and provides the means for expanding personal horizons and promoting community cultural life. today, however, the automobile is the principal form of transportation in urban areas. the private automobile has made a major contribution to economic growth and prosperity in this century. but now we must have better balanced transportation - more of it public. today, times as much federal aid goes to highways as to mass transit; tomorrow this must change. at the same time, it is important to preserve and improve transportation in america's rural areas, to end the crisis in rural mobility. the democratic party pledges: to create a single transportation trust fund, to replace the highway trust fund, with such additional funds as necessary to meet our transportation crisis substantially from federal resources. this fund will allocate monies for capital projects on a regional basis, permitting each region to determine its own needs under guidelines that will ensure a balanced transportation system and adequate funding of mass transit facilities. moreover, we will: assist local transit systems to meet their capital and operating needs. end the deterioration of rail and rural transportation and promote a flexible rural transportation system based on local, state and regional needs. take steps to meet the particular transportation problems of the elderly, the handicapped and others with special needs, and assist development of airport terminals, facilities and access to them, with due regard to impact on environment and community. environment, technology and resources. every american has the right to live, work and play in a clean, safe and healthy environment. we have the obligation to ourselves and to our children. it is not enough simply to prevent further environmental deterioration and the despoilation of our natural endowment. rather, we must improve the quality of the world in which we and they will live. the nixon administration's record on the environment is one of big promises and small actions. inadequate enforcement, uncertain requirements, reduced funding and a lack of manpower have undercut the effort commended by a democratic administration to clean up the environment. we must recognize the costs all americans pay for the environmental destruction with which we all live: poorer health, lessened recreational opportunities, higher maintenance costs, lower land productivity and diminished beauty in our surroundings. only then can we proceed wisely, yet vigorously with a program of environmental protection which recognizes that, although environmental protection will not be cheap, it is worth a far greater price, in effort and money, than we have spent thus far. such a program must include adequate federal funding for waste management, recycling and disposal and for purification and conservation of air and water resources. the next administration must reconcile any conflicts among the goals of cleaner air and water, inexpensive power and industrial development and jobs in specific places. these difficulties do exist - to deny them would be deceptive and irresponsible. at the same time, we know they can be resolved by an administration with energy, intelligence and commitment - qualities notably absent from the current administration's handling of the problem. we urge additional financial support to the united states forest service for planning and management consistent with the environmental ideal stated in this platform. choosing the right methods of environmental protection. the problem we face is to choose the most efficient, effective and equitable techniques for solving each new environmental problem. we cannot afford to waste resources while doing the job, any more than we can afford to leave the job undone. we must enforce the strict emission requirements on all pollution sources set under the clean air act. we must support the establishment of a policy of no harmful discharge into our waters by . we must have adequate staffing and funding of all regulatory and enforcement agencies and departments to implement laws, programs and regulations protecting the environment, vigorous prosecution of violators and a justice department committed to enforcement of environmental law. we must fully support laws to assure citizens' standing in federal environmental court suits. where appropriate, taxes need to be levied on pollution to provide industry with an incentive to clean up. strict interstate environmental standards must be formulated and enforced to prevent pollution from high-density population areas being dumped into low-density population areas for the purpose of evasion of strict pollution enforcement. the national environmental policy act should be broadened to include major private as well as public projects, and a genuine commitment must be made to making the act work. our environment is most threatened when the natural balance of an area's ecology is drastically altered for the sole purpose of' profits. such practices as ""clear cut"" logging, strip mining, the indiscriminate destruction of whole species, creation of select ocean crops at the expense of other species and the unregulated use of persistent pesticides cannot be justified when they threaten our ability to maintain a stable environment. we also need to develop new public agencies that can act to abate pollution - act on a scale commensurate with the size of the problem and the technology of pollution control. expanded federal funding is required to assist local governments with both the capital and operating expenses of water pollution control and solid waste management. jobs and the environment. the united states should not be condemned to the choice between the development of resources and economic security or preservation of those resources. a decent job for every american is a goal that need not, and must not, be sacrificed to our commitment to a clean environment. far from slowing economic growth, spending for environmental protection can create new job opportunities for many americans. nevertheless, some older and less efficient plants might find themselves in a worse competitive position due to environmental protection requirements. closely monitored adjustment assistance should be made available to those plants willing to modernize and institute environmental protection measures. science and technology. for years, the united state was the world's undisputed leader in science and technology. now that leadership is being challenged, in part because of the success of efforts in other countries, and in part because of the nixon administration's neglect of our basic human and material resources in this field. as democrats, we understand the enormous investment made by the nation in educating and training hundreds of thousands of highly skilled americans in science and technology. many of these people are now unemployed, as aerospace and defense programs are slowly cut back and as the administration's economic policies deprive these americans, as well as others, of their livelihood. so far, however, the nixon administration has paid scant attention to these problems. by contrast, the democratic party seeks both to increase efforts by the federal government and to stimulate research in private industry. in addition, the democratic party is committed to increasing the overall level of scientific research in the united states, which has been allowed to fall under the nixon administration. and we are eager to take management methods and techniques developed for the space and defense programs, as well as our technical resources, and apply them to the city, the environment, education, energy, transportation, health care and other urgent domestic needs. we propose also to work out a more effective relationship between government and industry in this area, to stimulate the latter to a greater research and development effort, thus helping buoy up the economy and create more jobs. finally, we will promote the search far new approaches in science and technology, so that the benefits of progress may be had without further endangering the environment - indeed, so that the environment may be better preserved. we must create a systematic way to decide which new technologies will contribute to the nation's development, and which will cause more problems than they solve. we are committed to a role for government in helping to bring the growth of technology into a harmonious relationship with our lives. energy resources. the earth's natural resources, once in abundant and seemingly unlimited supply, can no longer be taken for granted. in particular, the united states is facing major changes in the pattern of energy supply that will force us to reassess traditional policies. by , we may well have to depend on imports from the eastern hemisphere for as much as to percent of our oil supplies. at the same time new forms of energy supply - such as nuclear, solar or geothermal power - lag far behind in research and development. in view of these concerns, it is shocking that the nixon administration still steadfastly refuses to develop a national energy policy. the democratic party would remedy that glaring oversight. to begin with, we should: promote greater research and development both by government and by private industry, of unconventional energy sources such as solar power, geothermal power, energy from water and a variety of nuclear power possibilities to design clean breeder fission and fusion techniques. public funding in this area needs to be expanded, while retaining the principle of public administration of public funds. re-examine our traditional view of national security requirements in energy to reconcile them with our need for long-term abundant supplies of clean energy at reasonable cost. expand research on coal technology to minimize pollution, while making it possible to expand the efficiency of coal in meeting our energy needs. establish a national power plant siting procedure to examine and protect environmental values. reconcile the demand for energy with the demand to protect the environment. redistribute the cost of power among consumers, so that all, especially the poor, may be guaranteed adequate power at reasonable costs. develop a national power grid to improve the reliability and efficiency of our electricity system. end the practice of allowing promotional utility advertising as an expense when rates are set, and find new techniques to encourage the conservation of energy. we must also require fun disclosure of the energy needs of consumer products and home heating to enable consumers to make informed decisions on their use of energy. the oceans. as with the supply of energy, no longer can we take for granted the precious resources we derive from the oceans. here. too, we need comprehensive national and international policies to use and protect the vast potential contained in the sea. in particular we must: agree with other nations on stopping pollution of the seas, if they are not one day to become one large sewer, or be filled with dangerous poisons that will deprive us of vital food resources. agree with other nations on the conservation of food resources in the seas and promote the use of management techniques that will end the decline of the world's fish catch on the continental shelf through international cooperation for fishing gear regulations and species quota and preserve endangered species. agree on an international accord for the seas, so resources can he shared equitably among the world's nations. we must be prepared to act constructively at next year's conference on the law of the seas. begin to reconcile competing interests in the future of the seas, including our national security objectives, to protect ocean resources in cooperation with other nations, and support strongly the protection of ocean mammals (seal, whale, walrus) from indiscriminate destruction by both foreign and tuna fishing industries, but specifically exempting those native americans whose subsistence depends completely on their total use of the ocean's resources. ninety percent of all salt water fish species live on our continental shelves, where plant life is plentiful. for this reason, we support monitoring and strict enforcement of all safety regulations on all off-shore drilling equipment and on environmentally-safe construction of all tankers transporting oil. public lands. for generations, americans have been concerned with preserving the natural treasures of our country: our lakes and rivers, our forests and mountains. enlightened americans of the past decided that the federal government should take a major role in protecting these treasures, on behalf of everyone. today, however, neglect on the part of the nixon administration is threatening this most valued heritage - and that of our children. never before in modern history have our public lands been so neglected and the responsible agencies so starved of funds. the democratic party is concerned about preserving our public lands, and promoting policies of land management in keeping with the broad public interest. in particular, it is imperative to restore lost funds for land, park and forest management. it is imperative that decisions about the future use of our public lands be opened up to all the people for widespread public debate and discussion. only through such an open process can we set ground rules that appropriately limit the influence of special interests and allow for cohesive guidelines for national landuse planning. we are particularly aware of the potential conflicts among the use of land, rivers, lakes and the seashore for economic development, large-scale recreation and for preservation as unspoiled wilderness. we recognize that there are competing goals, and shall develop means for resolving these conflicts in a way that reflects the federal government's particular responsibilities as custodian for the public. we need more national seashores and expansion of the national park system. major steps must be taken to follow up on congressional commitment to scenic riverways. recreation areas must be made available to people where they live. this includes the extension of our national wilderness preserves to include de facto wilderness areas and their preservation free of commercialization. in this way, we will help to preserve and improve the quality of life for millions of our people. with regard to the development of the vast natural resources on our public lands, we pledge a renewed commitment to proceed in the interests of all our citizens. v. education ""the american people want overwhelmingly to give to our children and adults equitable educational opportunities of the highest possible quality, not predicated on race, not predicated on past social accomplishment or wealth, except in a compensatory way to those who have been deprived in the past."" -governor jimmy carter, atlanta hearing, june , our schools are failing our children. never, more than now, have we needed the schools to play their traditional role - to create a sense of national unity and to reconcile ethnic, religious and racial conflicts. yet the nixon administration - by ignoring the plight of the nation's schools, by twice vetoing funds for education - has contributed to this failure. america in the 's requires something the world has never seen: masses of educated people - educated to feel and to act, as well as to think. the children who enter school next fall still will be in the labor force in the year ; we cannot even imagine what american society will be like then, let alone what specific jobs they may hold. for them, education must be done by teaching them how to learn, how to apply man's wisdom to new problems as they arise and how to recognize new problems as they arise. education must prepare students not just to earn a living but to live a life - a creative, humane and sensitive life. school finance. achieving educational excellence requires adequate financial support. but today local property taxes - which do not keep pace with inflation - can no longer support educational needs. continued reliance on this revenue source imposes needless hardship on the american family without supplying the means for good schools. at the same time, the nixon recession has sapped the resources of state government, and the administration's insensitivity to school children has meant inadequate federal expenditures in education. the next democratic administration should: support equalization in spending among school districts. we support court decisions holding unconstitutional the disparities in school expenditures produced by dependence on local property taxes. we pledge equality of spending as a way to improve schools and to assure equality of access to good education for all children. increase federal financial aid for elementary and secondary education to enhance achievement of quality education anywhere, by fully funding the programs passed by the congress and by fully funding esea title i. step up efforts to meet the special needs and costs of educationally disadvantaged children handicapped by poverty, disability or non-english-speaking family background. channel financial aid by a constitutional formula to children in non-public schools. support suburban-urban cooperation in education to share resources and expenses. develop and implement the retraining of displaced black and other minority teachers affected by desegregation, and continue with full federal funding the breakfast and lunch programs for all children and the development of other programs to combat hunger. early childhood education. our youngest children are most ignored by national policy and most harshly treated by the nixon administration. president nixon's cruel, irresponsible veto of the comprehensive child development act of indicates dramatically the real values of the present administration. that legislation struck down by president nixon remains the best program to bring support to family units threatened by economic and social pressure to eliminate educational handicaps which leave disadvantaged children unable to compete m school: to prevent early childhood disease before it results in adult disability; to interrupt the painful, destructive cycle of welfare dependence, and, most important, to allow all children happy lives as children and the opportunity to develop their full potential. we support legislation for positive and preventive approaches to early childhood education. these approaches should be designed to help eliminate educational handicaps before they require remedial treatment. a democratic president will support and sign a program for universal comprehensive child development. we should give reality to the right of mentally retarded children to adequate health care and educational opportunities through such measures as including necessary care under national health insurance and federal aid to assure an opportunity for education for all retarded persons. equal access to quality education. the supreme court of the united states in brown v. board of education established the constitutional principle that states may not discriminate between school children on the basis of their race and that separate but equal has no place in our public education system. eighteen years later the provision of integration is not a reality. we support the goal of desegregation as a means to achieve equal access to quality education for all our children. there are many ways to desegregate schools: school attendance lines may be redrawn; schools may be paired; larger physical facilities may be built to serve larger, more diverse enrollments; magnet schools or educational parks may be used. transportation of students is another tool to accomplish desegregation. it may continue to be available according to supreme court decisions to eliminate legally imposed segregation and improve the quality of education for all children. bilingual education. ten percent of school children in the united states speak a language other than english in their homes and communities. the largest of the linguistic and cultural groups - spanish-speaking and american indians - are among the poorest people in the united states. increasing evidence indicates an almost total failure of public education to educate these children. the drop-out rates of spanish-speaking and indian children are the worst of any children in the country. the injury is compounded when such children are placed in special ""compensatory"" programs or programs for the ""dumb"" or the ""retards"" on the basis of tests and evaluations conducted in english. the passage of the bilingual education act of began a commitment by the nation to do something about the injustice committed against the bilingual child. but for -, congress appropriated $ million - enough to serve only two percent the children who need help. the next democratic administration should: increase federal support far bilingual, bicultural educational programs, pre-school through secondary school, including funding of bilingual adult basic education. ensure sufficient teacher training and curriculum development for such schools. implement an affirmative action program to train and hire bilingual-bicultural spanish-speaking persons at all levels of the educational system. provide inventories for state and local districts to initiate bilingual-bicultural educational programs. require testing of bilingual-bicultural children in their own languages, and prohibit discrimination against bilingual-bicultural children in school. career education. academic accomplishment is not the only way to financial success, job satisfaction or rewarding life in america. many young americans think that college is the only viable route when for some a vocational-technical career offers as much promise of a full life. moreover, the country desperately needs skilled workers, technicians, men and women who understand and can handle the tools and equipment that mean growth and jobs. by the need for skilled craftsmen will increase percent while the need for college-trained persons will remain stable. young people should be permitted to make a career choice consistent with their interests, aptitudes and aspirations. we must create an atmosphere where the dignity of work is respected, where diversity of talent and taste is encouraged and the continuing opportunity exists to keep pace with change and a saleable skill. to aid this, the next democratic administration can: give vocational-technical education the same priority in funds and emphasis previously given academic education. support full appropriations for the recently-passed occupational education act. strengthen the career counseling programs in elementary, secondary and post-secondary education so that young people are made aware of all of the opportunities open to them and provide special kinds of vocational-technical education and experience to meet specific area needs. develop and promote a climate conducive to free, rational choice by young people, dispelling the current prejudices that influence career decisions for most young people almost from birth. establish a lifetime system of continuing education to enhance career mobility, both vertically and laterally, so that the career choice made at or years of age does not have to be the only or the final choice, and grant equal representation to minorities and women in vocational-technical education. higher education. we support universal access to opportunities to post-secondary education. the american education system has always been an important path toward social and economic advancement. federal education policy should ensure that our colleges and universities continue as an open system. it must also stimulate the creative development and expansion of higher education to meet the new social, economic and environmental problems confronting society. to achieve the goals of equal opportunity in education, to meet the growing financial crisis in higher education and to stimulate reform of educational techniques, the next democratic administration should: support guaranteed access for all students to loan funds with long-term repayment based on future earnings. not only the poor, but families with moderate incomes must he provided relief from the cost of a college and professional education. grant supplements and contingent loans to institutions, based on enrollment of federally-aided students. provide research funds to stimulate a partnership between post-secondary, secondary and primary education, in an effort to find new patterns for learning and to provide training and re-training of teachers, especially in urban areas. develop broad opportunities for lifelong learning including encouragement for post-secondary education throughout adult years and permit ""stopping-off"" during higher education. develop affirmative programs in universities and colleges for recruitment of minorities and women for administrative and teaching positions and as students, and create incentives for non-traditional education which recognize the contribution of experience to an individual's educational status. arts and humanities. support for the arts and humanities is one of the benchmarks of a civilized society. yet, the continued existence of many of america's great symphonies, theatres and museums, our film institutes, dance companies and other art forms, is now threatened by rising costs, and the public contribution, far less than in most advanced industrial societies, is a fraction of the need. we should expand support of the arts and humanities by direct grants through the national foundation for the arts and humanities, whose policy should be to stimulate the widest variety of artistic and scholarly expression. we should support long-range financing for public broadcasting, insulated from political pressures. we deplore the nixon administration's crude efforts to starve and muzzle public broadcasting, which has become a vital supplement to commercial television. vi. crime, law and justice ""i think we can reduce crime. society has no more important challenge because crime is human conduct and more than any other activity of people it reflects the moral character of a nation."" - ramsey clark, washington hearing, june , we advocate and seek a society and a government in which there is an attitude of respect for the law and for those who seek its enforcement and an insistence on the part of our citizens that the judiciary be ever mindful of their primary duty and function of punishing the guilty and protecting the innocent. we will insist on prompt, fair and equal treatment for all persons before the bar of justice. the problem of crime in america is real, immediate and fundamental; its costs to the nation are staggering; nearly three quarters of a million victims of violent crime in one year alone; more than , murders, billions of dollars of property loss. the indirect, intangible costs are even more ominous. a frightened nation is not a free nation. its citizens are prisoners suspicious of the people they meet, restricted in when they go out and when they return, threatened even in their own homes. unless government at all levels can restore a sense of confidence and security to its people, there is the ever-present danger that alarm will turn to panic, triggering short-cut remedies that jeopardize hard-won liberties. when law enforcement breaks down, not only the victims of street violence suffer; the worker's health and safety is imperiled by unsafe, illegal conditions on the job; the society is defenseless against fraud and pollution; most tragically of all, parents and communities are ravaged by traffic in dangerous drugs. the nixon administration campaigned on a pledge to reduce crime - to strengthen the ""peace forces"" against the ""criminal forces."" despite claims to the contrary, that pledge has been broken: violent crime has increased by one-third, to the highest levels in our history. fueled by the immense profits of narcotics traffic, organized crime has thrust its corruption farther and farther, into law enforcement agencies and the halls of justice. the department of justice has become the handmaiden of the white house political apparatus, offering favors to those special interests which buy their ""law"" in washington. the justice department has failed to enforce laws protecting key legal rights, such as the voting rights act of . nixon and mitchell use federal crime control funds for political purposes, squandering $. billion. to reverse this course, through equal enforcement of the law, and to rebuild justice the democratic party believes: the impact of crime in america cuts across racial, geographic and economic lines. hard-line rhetoric, pandering to emotion, is both futile and destructive. we can protect all people without undermining fundamental liberties by ceasing to use ""law and order"" as justification far repression and political persecution, and by ceasing to use stop-gap measures as preventive detention, ""no-knock"" entry, surveillance, promiscuous and unauthorized use of wire taps, harassment, and secret dossiers, and the problems of crime and drug abuse cannot be isolated from the social and economic conditions that give rise to them. preventing crime. effective law enforcement requires tough planning and action. this administration has given us nothing but tough words. together with unequal law enforcement by police, prosecutors and judges, the result is a ""turnstile"" system of injustice, where most of those who commit crime are not arrested, most of those arrested are not prosecuted, and many of those prosecuted are not convicted. under this administration, the conviction rate for federal prosecutions has declined to one-half its former level. tens of thousands of offenders simply never appear in court and are heard from again only when the commit another crime. this system does not deter crime. it invites it. it will be changed only when all levels of government act to return firmness and fairness to every part of the criminal justice system. fear of crime, and firm action against it, is not racism. indeed the greatest victims of crime today - whether of business fraud or of the narcotics plague - are the people of the ghetto, black and brown. fear now stalks their streets far more than it does the suburbs. so that americans can again live without fear of each other the democratic party believes: there must be equally stringent law enforcement for rich and poor, corporate and individual offenders. citizens must be actively involved with the police in a joint effort. police forces must be upgraded, and recruiting of highly qualified and motivated policemen must be made easier through federally assisted pay commensurate with the difficulty and importance of their job, and improved training with comprehensive scholarship and financial support for anyone who is serving or win contract to serve for an appropriate period of police service. the complex job of policing requires a sensitivity to the changing social demands of the communities in which police operate. we must provide the police with increased technological facilities and support more efficient use of police resources, both human and material. when a person is arrested, both justice and effective deterrence of crime require that he be speedily tried, convicted or acquitted, and if convicted, promptly sentenced. to this end we support financial assistance to local courts, prosecutors, and independent defense counsel for expansion, streamlining, and upgrading, with trial in days as the goal. to train local and state police officers, a police academy on a par with the other service academies should be established as well as an academy of judicial administration. we will provide every assistance to our law enforcement agencies at federal and local levels in the training of personnel and the improvement of techniques and will encourage mutual cooperation between each in its own sphere of responsibility. we will support needed legislation and action to seek out and bring to justice the criminal organizations of national scope operating in our country. we will provide leadership and action in a national effort against the usage of drugs and drug addiction, attacking this problem at every level and every source in a full scale campaign to drive this evil from our society. we recognize drug addiction as a health problem and pledge that emphasis will be put on rehabilitation of addicts. we will provide increased emphasis in the area of juvenile delinquency and juvenile offenses in order to deter and rehabilitate young offenders. there must be laws to control the improper use of hand guns. four years ago a candidate for the presidency was slain by a hand gun. two months ago, another candidate for that office was gravely wounded. three out of four police officers killed in the line of duty are slain with hand guns. effective legislation must include a ban on sale of hand guns known as saturday night specials which are unsuitable for sporting purposes. a comprehensive fully funded program is needed to improve juvenile justice, to ensure minimum standards, to expand research into rehabilitation techniques, including alternatives to reform schools and coordinate existing programs for treating juvenile delinquency, and the block-grant system of the law enforcement assistance administration which has produced ineffectiveness, waste and corruption should be eliminated. funds should go directly to operating agencies that are committed to change and improvement in local law enforcement, including agencies concerned with research, rehabilitation, training and treatment. narcotic drugs. drug addiction and alcoholism are health problems. drugs prey on children, destroy lives and communities, force crimes to satisfy addicts, corrupt police and government and finance the expansion of organized crime. a massive national effort, equal to the scale and complexity of the problem, is essential. the next democratic administration should support: a massive law enforcement effort, supported by increased funds and personnel, against the suppliers and distributors of heroin and other dangerous drugs. with increased penalties for major narcotics traffickers. full use of all existing resources to halt the illegal entry of narcotics into the united states, including suspension of economic and military assistance to any country that fails to take appropriate steps to prevent narcotic drugs produced or processed in that country from entering the united states illegally, and increases in customs personnel fighting smuggling of hard drugs. an all-out investigative and prosecutory effort against corruption in government and law enforcement. where corruption exists it is a major factor in permitting criminal activity, especially large-scale narcotic distribution, to flourish. it also destroys respect for the law in all who are conscious of its operation. we are determined that our children - whether in the ghetto or in a suburban high school - shall no longer be able to see a pusher protected from prosecution, openly plying his trade. strict regulation and vigorous enforcement of existing quotas regulating production and distribution of dangerous drugs, including amphetamines and barbiturates. to prevent diversion into illegal markets, with legislation for strong criminal penalties against drug manufacturers engaging in illegal overproduction, distribution and importation. expanded research into dangerous drugs and their abuse, focusing especially on heroin addiction among the young, development of effective, non-addictive heroin treatment. concentration of law enforcement efforts on major suppliers and distributors with most individual users diverted into treatment before prosecution. immediate placement in medical or psychiatric treatment available to any individual drug abuser without fear of disclosure or harrassment. work opportunities should be provided for addicts in treatment by supported work and other programs, and drug education in schools based on fact, not scare tactics to teach young people the dangers of different drugs, and full treatment opportunities for youthful drug abusers. hard drug trafficking in schools must be met with the strongest possible law enforcement. organized and professional crime. we are determined to exert the maximum power and authority of the federal government to protect the many victims who cannot help themselves against great criminal combinations. against the organized criminal syndicates, we pledge an expanded federal enforcement effort; one not restricted to criminals of any particular ethnic group, but which recognizes that organized crime in the united states cuts across all boundaries of race, national origin and class. against white-collar crime, we pledge to enforce the maximum penalties provided by law. justice cannot survive when, as too often is the case, a boy who steals a television set is sentenced to a long jail term, while a stock manipulator who steals millions is only commanded to sin no more. at least where life or personal injury are at stake, we pledge to seek expanded criminal penalties for the violation of federal laws. employers who violate the worker safety and health laws, or manufacturers who knowingly sell unsafe products or drugs profit from death and injury as knowingly as the common mugger. they deserve equally severe punishment. rehabilitation of offenders. few institutions in america are as uniformly condemned and as consistently ignored as in our existing prison system. many prisons that are supposed to rehabilitate and separate, in fact train their inmates for nothing but brutality and a life of further crime. only when public understanding recognizes that our existing ""corrections"" system contributes to escalating crime, will we get the massive effort necessary for fundamental restructuring. therefore, the democratic party commits itself to: restoration, after release, of rights to obtain drivers' licenses and to public and private employment, and, after completion of sentence and conditions of parole, restoration of civil rights to vote and hold public office. revision of sentencing procedures and greater use of community-based rehabilitation facilities, especially for juveniles. recognition of the constitutional and human rights of prisoners; realistic therapeutic, vocational, wage-earning, education, alcoholism and drug treatment programs. making correctional personnel an integral part of the rehabilitative process. emergency, educational and work-release furlough programs as an available technique, support for ""self-help"" programs, and restoration of civil rights to ex-convicts after completion of their sentences, including the right to vote, to hold public office to obtain drivers' licenses and to public and private employment. the quality of justice. justice is not merely effective law enforcement - though that is an essential part of it. justice rather, expresses the moral character of a nation and its commitment to the rule of law, to equality of all people before the law. the democratic parts believes that nothing must abridge the faith of the american citizens in their system of law and justice. we believe that the quality of justice will be enhanced by: equal treatment for all citizens in the court without fear or favor -- corporations as well as individual attenders. swift trials for accused persons. equitable pre-trial release systems and the elimination of plea bargaining abuse. ending subversion of the legal system for political gain in court appointments, in anti-trust cases and in administration of law enforcement programs. administering the laws and funding enacted by the congress. respecting and abiding by constitutional protections of due process, and abolishing capital punishment, recognized as an effective deterrent to crime, unequally applied and cruel and excessive punishment . vii. farming and rural life ""a blight hangs over the land caused by misguided farm policies."" - tony dechant, sioux city, june , for many decades, american agriculture has been the envy of the world; and american farmers and american ranchers have made possible a level of nutrition and abundance for our people that is unrivaled in history, while feeding millions of people abroad. the basis far this success - and its promise for the future - lies with the family-type farm. it can and must be preserved, in the best interests at all americans and the nation's welfare. today, as dwindling income forces thousands of family farmers into bankruptcy each year, the family-type farm is threatened with extinction. american farming is passing to corporate control. these trends will benefit few of our people, while hurting many. the dominance of american food production by the large corporation would destroy individual enterprise and links that millions of our people have with the land; and it would lead to higher prices and higher food costs for everyone. major efforts must be made to present this disaster for the fabric at rural life, for the american farmer, rancher, farm worker and for the consumer and other rural people throughout our nation: farm become must he improved to enable farmers, ranchers and farm workers to produce a steady and dependable supply of food and fiber products in return for full parity; and we must recognize and fulfill the social contract that exists between the family-farm producers of food and the non-farm consumer. the democratic party understands these urgent needs; the nixon administration does not and has failed the american farmer. its record today is consistent with the republican record of the past: low prices, farm surpluses that depress the market in callous disregard for the people in rural america. this administration has sold out agriculture to interests bent on eliminating family-type farmers and bent on delivering agriculture to conglomerates, agribusiness giants and investors seeking to avoid taxes. its policies hare driven farm income as low as percent of parity, unequalled since the depression. between , and , farm families are driven off the land each year. hundreds of thousands of demoralized people are being forced into overcrowded cities, emptying the countryside and bankrupting small business in rural towns and cities. the nixon administration tries to hide its failures by misleading the people, juggling the parity formula to make prices look higher, distorting reports to make corporate farming look insignificant and trying to break up the u.s. department of agriculture and still the farmer's voice. the democratic party will reverse these disastrous policies and begin to recreate a rural society of widespread family farming, individual opportunity and private and cooperative enterprises, where honest work will bring a decent income. we repudiate the administration's set-aside program, which pushes up the cost of farm programs while building huge surpluses that depress prices. we repudiate the report of the usda young executives committee which would eliminate the family-type farm by ending price support, loan and purchasing programs on all farm commodities and which would put farm people on the welfare rolls. we repudiate a presidential commission report recommending that future federal investment in many small towns and cities should make their decline merely more bearable rather than reverse it. in place of these negative and harmful policies, the democratic party pledges itself to take positive and decisive action: we will replace the farm act, when it expires next year, with a permanent law to provide fair prices to family-type farm and ranch operators. this law will include loans and payments to farmers and effective supply management to raise family farm income to percent of parity, based on the - ratios; we will resist a price ceiling on agriculture products until farm prices reach percent of parity based on the - ratios, and we will conduct a consumer education program to inform all americans of the relationship between the prices of raw commodities and retail prices: we will end farm program benefits to farm units larger than family-size, and we will work for production adjustment that will assure adequate food and fiber for all our people, including low-income families and individuals whose purchasing power is supplemented with food stamps and that can provide enough commodities for export and for the food for peace program. exporting our abundance. for many years, farm exports have made a major contribution to our balances of trade and payments. but this benefit for the entire nation must not be purchased with depressed prices for the producer. the democratic party will ensure that: prices far commodities sent abroad as exports or aid return the cost of production plus a profit for the american farmer. we will negotiate international commodity agreements to include prices that guarantee prices to producers based on cost of production plus a reasonable profit. we will require u.s. corporations producing commodities outside the country for consumption here to pay duties high enough to prevent unfair competition for domestic producers. we will assure that the same rigid standards for inspection of domestic dairy products and meat will be applied to imports, and we will create a strategic reserve of storable commodities, insulated from the market, rotated regularly to maintain quality and stored to the extent possible on farms. strengthening the family farm. these policies and actions will not be enough on their own to strengthen the family farm. the democratic party also recognizes that farmers and ranchers must be able to gain economic strength in the marketplace by organizing and bargaining collectively for the sale of their products. and they need to be free of unfair competition from monopoly and other restrictive corporate practices. we therefore pledge: to remove all obstacles to farm bargaining for the sale of products. to extend authority for marketing orders to all farm commodities including those used for processing. to prohibit farming, or the gaining of monopolistic control of production, on the part of corporations whose resources and income derive primarily from non-farm sources. to investigate violations and enforce anti-trust laws in corporation-agriculture-agribusiness interlocks. to prohibit corporations and individuals from setting up tax shelters or otherwise engaging in agriculture primarily for the purpose of tax avoidance or tax loss. to encourage and support the use of cooperatives and membership associations in all areas of the country, which we pledge to protect from interference, punitive taxation or other hindrances, and to assist small rural cooperatives to promote projects in housing, health, social services, marketing, farming employment and transportation for rural areas with such things as technical assistance and credit. guaranteeing farm people a voice. none of these policies can begin to work unless farmers, ranchers, farm workers and other rural people have full rights of participation in our democratic institutions of government. the democratic party is committed to seeing that family-type farmers and ranchers will be heard and that they will have ample opportunity to help shape policies attesting agriculture and rural america. to this end: we support the appointment of a farmer or rancher as secretary of agriculture. we oppose all efforts to abolish or dismantle the u.s. department of agriculture. we will require that decisions relating to dams and other public land-use projects in rural areas involving federal funds be considered at well-publicized public hearings. government is not now giving adequate protection to individual rights in condemnation procedures. it must set new and better procedures and requirements to assure individual rights. we support the united farm workers in their non-violent efforts to gain collective bargaining recognition and contracts. we also support unemployment insurance compensation benefits, workman's compensation benefits and delivery of health services for farm workers, and we support the removal of sugar workers from the custody of the u.s. department at agriculture. revitalizing rural america. sound rural development must start with improved farm income, which also promotes the prosperity of the small businesses that serve all rural people. but there must be other efforts, as well, to ensure equity for farm and rural people in the american economy. the democratic party pledges: to support the rural cooperative electrification and telephone programs and to implement rural transportation programs as explained in the section cities, communities, counties and the environment of this platform. we will extend the agricultural exemption in the motor carriers act to products and supplies and ensure rural areas an equitable share of highway trust funds. to apply general revenue sharing in ways that will permit state and local taxation of family farm lands on the basis of value for farm use rather than value for land speculation. to guarantee equal treatment of rural and urban areas in the provision of federal funds for schools, poverty programs, health facilities, housing highways, air services, pollution control, senior citizen programs and employment opportunities and manpower and training programs. to provide loans to aid young farm families and small businesses to get established in rural areas, and to ensure agricultural research toward an examination of the social and economic consequences of technology. the prime goal of land grant colleges and research should be to help family farms and rural people. viii. foreign policy ""the administration is continuing a war - continuing the killing of americans and vietnamese - when our national security is not at stake. ""it is our duty as the opposition party to point out the administration's errors and to offer a responsible alternate""- w. averell harriman, new york hearing, june , strength in defense and wisdom in foreign affairs are essential to prosperity and tranquility. in the modern world, there can be no isolationism in reality or policy. but the measure of our nation's rank in the world must be our success in achieving a just and peaceful society at home. for the nixon administration, foreign policy results have fallen short of the attention and the slogans. after four years of ""vietnamization,"" the war in southeast asia continues and nixon's plan is still a secret. vital foreign policy decisions are made without consulting with congress or our allies, and executive secrecy runs wild with unparalleled efforts to intimidate the media and suppress those who seek to put a different view before the american people. the next democratic administration should: end american participation in the war in southeast asia. re-establish control over military activities and reduce military spending, where consistent with national security. defend america's real interests and maintain our alliances, neither playing world policeman nor abandoning old and good friends. not neglect america's relations with small third-world nations in placing reliance on great power relationships. return to congress, and to the people, a meaningful role in decisions on peace and war, and make information public, except where real national defense interests are involved. vietnam. nothing better describes the need for a new american foreign policy than the fact that now, as for the past seven years, it begins with the war in vietnam. the task now is still to end the war, not to decide who is to blame for it. the democratic party must share the responsibility for this tragic war. but, elected with a secret plan to end this war, nixon's plan is still secret, and we - and the vietnamese - have had four more years of fighting and death. it is true that our involvement on the ground has been reduced. troops are coming home. but the war has been extended in laos and cambodia; the bombing of north vietnam has been expanded to levels of destruction undreamed of four years ago; north vietnam has been blockaded; the number of refugees increases each day, and the secretary of defense warns us of still further escalation. all this has accomplished nothing except to prolong the war. t he hollowness of ""vietnamization"" - a delusive slogan seeming to offer cheap victory - has been exposed by the recent offensive. the saigon government, despite massive u.s. support is still not viable. it is militarily ineffective, politically corrupt and economically near collapse. yet it is for this regime that americans still die, and american prisoners still rot in indo-china camps. the plight of these american prisoners justly arouses the concern of all americans. we must insist that any resolute war include the return of all prisoners held by north vietnam and other adversary forces and the fullest possible accounting for the missing. with increasing lack of credibility, the nixon administration has sought to use the prisoners of war as an excuse for its policies. it has refused to make the simple, definite and final end to u.s. participation in the war, in conjunction with return of all u.s. prisoners. the majority of the democratic senators have called for full u.s. withdrawal by october , . we support that position. if the war is not ended before the next democratic administration takes office, we pledge, as the first order of business, an immediate and complete withdrawal of all u.s. farces in indo-china. all u.s. military action in southeast asia will cease. after the end of u.s. direct combat participation, military aid to the saigon government, and elsewhere in indo-china, will be terminated. the u.s. will no longer seek to determine the political future of the nations of indo-china. the issue is not whether we will depose the present south vietnamese government, rather when we will cease insisting that it must be the core of any political settlement. we will do what we can to foster an agreement on an acceptable political solution - but we recognize that there are sharp limits to our ability to influence this process, and to the importance of the outcome to our interest. disengagement from this terrible war will not be a ""defeat"" for america. it will not imply any weakness in america's will or ability to protect its vital interests from attack. on the contrary disengagement will enable us to heal domestic diversions and to end the distortion of our international priorities which the war has caused. a democratic administration will act to ease the hard transitions which will come with an end to this war. we pledge to offer to the people of vietnam humanitarian assistance to help them repair the ravages of years of war to the economy and to the people of that devastated land. to our own people, we pledge a true effort to extend the hand of reconciliation and assistance to those most affected by the war. t those who have served in this war, we pledge a full g.i. bill of rights, with benefits sufficient to pay for an education of the veteran's choice, job training programs and the guarantee of employment and the best medical care this country can provide, including a full program of rehabilitation for those who hare returned addicted to dangerous drugs. to those who for reasons of conscience refused to serve in this war and were prosecuted or sought refuge abroad, we state our firm intention to declare an amnesty, on an appropriate basis, when the fighting has ceased and our troops and prisoners of war have returned. military policy. we propose a program of national defense which is both prudent and responsible, which will retain the confidence of our allies and which will be a deterrent to potential aggressors. military strength remains an essential element of a responsible international policy. america must have the strength required for effective deterrence. but military defense cannot be treated in isolation from other vital national concerns. spending for military purposes is greater by far than federal spending for education, housing, environmental protection, unemployment insurance or welfare. unneeded dollars for the military at once add to the tax burden and pre-empt funds from programs of direct and immediate benefit to our people. moreover, too much that is now spent on defense not only adds nothing to our strength but makes us less secure by stimulating other countries to respond. under the nixon stewardship of our defense policy, lack of sound management controls over defense projects threatens to price us out of an adequate defense. the reaction of the defense department to exposure of cost overruns has been to strike back at the critics instead of acting to stop the waste. needless projects continue and grow, despite evidence of waste, military ineffectiveness and even affirmative danger to real security. the ""development"" budget starts pressure for larger procurement budgets in a few years. morale and military effectiveness deteriorate as drugs, desertion and racial hatreds plague the armed forces, especially in vietnam. the democratic party pledges itself to maintain adequate military forces for deterrence and effective support of our international position. but we will also insist on the firm control of specific costs and projects that are essential to ensure that each defense dollar makes a real contribution to national security. specifically, a democratic administration should: plan military budgets on the basis of our present needs and commitments, not past practices or force levels. stress simplicity and effectiveness in new weapons and stop goldplating and duplication which threaten to spawn a new succession of costly military white elephants; avoid commitment to new weapons unless and until it becomes clear that they are needed. reject calls to use the salt agreement as an excuse for wasteful and dangerous acceleration of our military spending. reduce overseas bases and forces, and rebuild the morale and military tradition of our armed farces through creative programs to combat drug abuse, racial tensions and eroded pride in service. we will support reforms of the conditions of military life to restore military service as an attractive career for men and women from all segments of our society. by these reforms and this new approach to budgeting coupled with a prompt end to u.s. involvement in the war in indo-china, the military budget can be reduced substantially with no weakening of our national security. indeed a leaner, better-run system will mean added strength, efficiency and morale for our military forces. workers and industries now dependent on defense spending should not be made to pay the price of altering our priorities. therefore, we pledge reconversion policies and government resources to assure jobs and new industrial opportunities for all those adversely affected by curtailed defense spending. draft. we urge abolition of the draft. disarmament and arms control. the democratic party stands for keeping america strong; we reject the concept of unilateral reductions below levels needed for adequate military defense. but effective international arms control and disarmament do not threaten american security; they enhance it. the last democratic administration took the lead in pressing for u.s.-soviet agreement on strategic arms limitation. the recent salt agreement is an important and useful first step. the salt agreement should be quickly ratified and taken as a starting point for new agreements. it must not be used as an excuse for new ""bargaining chip"" military programs or the next round of the arms race. the next democratic administration should: carry on negotiations to expand the initial salt agreement to other areas, especially to seek limits to the qualitative arms race and to begin reducing force levels on each side. seek a comprehensive ban on all nuclear testing, verified, as salt will be, by national means. press for wide adherence to the non-proliferation treaty, signed in , and for extension of the concept of nuclear-free regions. seek ratification of the protocol on chemical warfare without reservations. in concert with our allies, pursue with the u.s.s.r. mutual force reductions in europe, and widen the range of arms control discussions to include new subjects, such as mutual budget cuts, control of arms transfer to developing countries, restrictions on naval force deployments and other measures to limit conventional forces. u.s. and the world community. a new foreign policy must be adequate for a rapidly changing world. we welcome the opportunity this brings for improved relations with the u.s.s.r. and china. but we value even more america's relations with our friends and allies in the hemisphere, in western europe, japan and other industrialized countries, israel and the middle east, and in the developing nations of asia and africa. with them, our relations must be conducted on a basis of mutual trust and consultation, seeking to strengthen our ties and to resolve differences on a basis of mutual advantage. throughout the world, the focus of our policy should be a commitment to peace, self-determination, development, liberty and international cooperation, without distortion in favor of military points of view. europe. europe's increasing economic and political strength and the growing cooperation and self-confidence of its people have made the atlantic alliance a partnership of equals. if we face the challenge of this new relationship, our historic partnership can endure. the next democratic administration should: reduce u.s. troop levels in europe in close consultation with our allies, as part of a program to adjust nato to changed conditions. what is essential in our relations with the other nato nations is not a particular troop level, but our continued commitment to collective defenses pledge to work in greater cooperation with the european economic communities to ensure that integration in europe does not serve as a formula for discrimination against american goods and enterprises. cease american support for the repressive greek military government, and make the voice of the united states heard in northern ireland against violence and terror and against the discrimination, repression and deprivation which brought about that awful civil strife. we welcome every improvement in relations between the united states and the soviet union and every step taken toward reaching vital agreements on trade and other subjects. however, in our pursuit of improved relations, america cannot afford to be blind to the continued existence of serious differences between us. in particular. the united states should, by diplomatic contacts, seek to mobilize world opinion to express concern at the denial to the oppressed peoples of eastern europe and the minorities of the soviet union, including the soviet jews, of the right to practice their religion and culture and to leave their respective countries. middle east. the united states must be unequivocally committed to support of israel's right to exist within secure and defensible boundaries. progress toward a negotiated political settlement in the middle east will permit israel and her arab neighbors to live at peace with each other, and to turn their energies to internal development. it will also free the world from the threat of the explosion of mid-east tensions into world war. in working toward a settlement, our continuing pledge to the security and freedom of israel must be both clear and consistent. the next democratic administration should: make and carry out a firm, long-term public commitment to provide israel with aircraft and other military equipment in the quantity and sophistication she needs to preserve her deterrent strength in the face of soviet arsenaling of arab threats of renewed war. seek to bring the parties into direct negotiations toward a permanent political solution based on the necessity of agreement on secure and defensible national boundaries. maintain a political commitment and a military force in europe and at sea in the mediterranean ample to deter the soviet union from putting unbearable pressure on israel. recognize and support the established status of jerusalem as the capital of israel, with free access to all its holy places provided to all faiths. as a symbol of this stand, the u.s. embassy should be moved from tel aviv to jerusalem, and recognize the responsibility of the world community for a just solution to the problems of the arab and jewish refugees. africa. the central feature of african politics today is the struggle against racism and colonialism in southern africa. there should be no mistake about which side we are on. we stand for full political, civil and economic rights for black and other non-white peoples in southern africa. we are against white-minority rule. we should not underwrite a return to the interventionism of the past. but we can end united states complicity with such governments. the focus of america's concern with africa must be on economic and social development. economic aid to africa, without political conditions, should be expanded, and african states assured an adequate share of the aid dollar. military aid and aid given for military purposes should he sharply reduced. all military aid to portugal should be stopped and the nixon $ million deal for unneeded azores bases should be cancelled. u.n. sanctions against the illegal racist regime in southern rhodesia should be supported vigorously, especially as they apply to chrome imports. the u.s. should give full support to u.n. assertion of its control over namibia (south west africa), in accordance with the world court's ruling. the u.s. should make clear its opposition to the radar totalitarianism of south africa. the u.s. government should act firmly to press u.s. businesses in south africa to take measures for the fullest possible justice for their black employees. blacks should be assigned at all levels to u.s. offices in south africa, and throughout africa. the south african sugar quota should be withdrawn. no u.s. company or its subsidiary should be given u.s. tax credit for taxes paid to white-minority-ruled countries of africa. asia. japan. our relations with japan have been severely strained by a series of ""nixon shocks."" we must restore our friendship with japan, the leading industrial nation of asia and a growing world power. there are genuine issues between us and japan in the economic area, but accommodation of trade problems will be greatly eased by an end to the nixon administration's calculated insensitivity to japan and her interests, marked by repeated failures to afford advance warnings, much less consultation over sudden shifts in u.s. diplomatic and economic policy that affect japan. india, pakistan and bangla desh. a democratic administration should work to restore the damage done to america's friendship with india as a result of the administration's folly in ""tilting"" in favor of pakistan and against bangla desh. the alienation by the nixon administration of india, the world's largest democracy, and the continued suspension of economic aid to india have seriously damaged the status of the united states in asia. we pledge generous support for the essential work of reconstruction and reconciliation in bangla desh. at the same time, we will maintain friendship and developmental assistance to the ""new"" pakistan which has emerged from these sad events. china. the beginning of a new u.s.-china relationship is welcome and important. however, so far, little of substance has changed, and the exaggerated secrecy and rhetoric of the nixon administration have produced unnecessary complications in our relationship with our allies and friends in asia and with the u.s.s.r. what is needed now is serious negotiation on trade, travel exchanges and progress on more basic issues. the u.s. should take the steps necessary to establish regular diplomatic relations with china. other asian countries. the future of asia will be determined by its people, not by the united states. we should support accommodation and cooperation among all asian countries and continue to assist in economic development. canada. a democratic administration should restore close u.s.-canadian cooperation and communication, respecting canada's nationhood and pride. in settling economic issues, we should not compromise our interests, but seek mutually advantageous and equitable solutions. in areas such as environmental protection and social policies, the americans and canadians share common problems and we must act together. latin america. the good neighbor policy of franklin roosevelt and the alliance for progress of john kennedy set still-living goals - insulation from external political conflicts, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, and support for political liberty, social justice and economic progress. the nixon administration has lost sight of these goals, and the result is hostility and suspicion of the u.s. unmatched in generations. the next democratic administration should: re-establish an inter-american alliance of equal sovereign nations working cooperatively for development. sharply reduce military assistance throughout the area. strive to deepen the exchange of people and ideas within the hemisphere. take account of the special claims of democratically elected governments on our resources and sympathy. pursue a policy of non-intervention by military means in domestic affairs of latin american nations. recognize that, while cuba must not be permitted to become a foreign military base, after years of boycott, crisis and hostility the time has come to re-examine our relations with cuba and to seek a way to resolve this cold war confrontation on mutually acceptable terms, and re-establish a u.s. - mexico border commission, with mexican-american representatives, to develop a comprehensive program to desalinate and eradicate pollution of the colorado river and other waterways flowing into mexico, and conduct substantial programs to raise the economic level on both sides of the border. this should remove the economic reasons which contribute to illegal immigration and discourage run-away industries. in addition, language requirements for citizenship should be removed. the united nations. the u.n. cannot solve all the great political problems of our time, but in an increasingly interdependent world, a world body is essential and its potential must be increasingly relied upon. the next democratic administration should: re-establish the u.n. as a key forum for international activity and assign representatives with the highest qualification for diplomacy. give strong executive branch leadership for u.s. acceptance of its obligations for u.n. financing, while renegotiating arrangements for sharing u.n. costs. abide by the binding u.n. security council decision on rhodesia sanctions, and support u.n. peace-keeping efforts. work for development of enforceable world law as a basis for peace, and endorse repeal of the connally reservation on u.s. acceptance of world court jurisdiction, and work to involve the u.n. increasingly on the complex technical and social problems such as pollution, health. communication, technology and population policy, which are worldwide in scope and demand a worldwide approach, and help provide the means for these u.n. efforts and for u.n. economic development functions. international economic policy. in a prosperous economy, foreign trade has benefits for virtually everyone. for the consumer, it means lower prices and a wider choice of goods. for the worker and the businessman, it means new jobs and new markets. for nations it means greater efficiency and growth. but in a weak economy - with over five million men and women out of work - foreign imports bring hardships to many americans. the automobile or electrical worker, the electronics technician, the small businessman - for them, and millions of others, foreign competition coinciding with a slack economy has spelled financial distress. our national commitment to liberal trade policies takes its toll when times are bad, but yields its benefits when the economy is fully employed. the democratic party proposes no retreat from this commitment. our international economic policy should have these goals: to expand jobs and business opportunities in this country and to establish two-way trade relations with other nations. to do this, we support the following policies: end the high-unemployment policy of the nixon administration. when a job is available for everyone who wants work, imports will no longer be a threat. full employment is a realistic goal, it is a goal which has been attained under democratic administrations, and it is a goal we intend to achieve again. adopt broad programs to ease dislocations and relieve the hardship of workers injured by foreign competition. seek higher labor standards in the advanced nations where productivity far outstrips wage rates, thus providing unfair competition to american workers and seek to limit harmful flows of american capital which exploit both foreign and american workers. adhere to liberal trade policies, but we should oppose actions and policies which harm american workers through unfair exploitation of labor abroad and the encouragement of american capital to run after very low wage opportunities for quick profits that will damage the economy of the united states and further weaken the dollar. negotiate orderly and reciprocal reductions of trade barriers to american products. foreign nations with access to our markets should no longer be permitted to fence us out of theirs. support reform of the international monetary system. increased international reserves, provision for large margins in foreign exchange fluctuations and strengthened institutions for the coordination of national economic policies can free our government and others to achieve full employment. support efforts to promote exports of american farm products, and develop ground rules for pollution controls with our industrialized trading partners so that no country gains competitive advantage at the expense of the environment. developing nations. poverty at home or abroad is part of a common problem. great and growing income gaps among nations are no more tenable than such gaps among groups in our own country. we should remain committed to u.s. support for economic and social development of countries in need. old ways of providing aid must be revised - to reduce u.s. involvement in administration to encourage other nations to contribute jointly with us. but funding must be adequate to help poor countries achieve accelerated rates of growth. specifically, the next democratic administration should support: provision of more assistance through international organizations, along with measures to strengthen the development agencies of the u.n. a curtailment of military aid. improved access to the markets of industrial nations for the products of the developing countries. a greater role in international monetary affairs for poor countries; in particular distributing the new special drawing rights in support of the poor countries, and a fair share for poor countries in the resources of the seabeds. the methods and structures of u.s. foreign and military policy. the needed fundamental reordering of u.s. foreign and military policy calls for changes in the structure of decisionmaking, as well as in particular policies. this means: greater sharing with congress of real decisions on issues of war and peace, and providing congress with the information and resources needed for a more responsible role. more honest information policies, beginning with a fundamental reform of the document classification system and including regular press conferences by the president, his cabinet and senior advisers. ending the present drastic overbalance in favor of military opinion by redefining the range of agencies and points of view with a proper claim to be heard on foreign and military policies. subjecting the military budget to effective civilian control and supervision. establishing effective executive control and legislative oversight of the intelligence agencies. ending political dimination of usia's reporting and peace corps dedication and, in general, making it clear that the white house understands the crucial distinction between dissent and disloyalty, and urging the appointment of minority americans to top positions of ambassadors and diplomats, to let the world know that america is a multi-racial nation and proud of it. ix. the people and the government ""our people are disspirited because there seems to be no way by which they can call to office a government which will cut the ties to the past, meet the challenge of leadership and begin a new era of bold action. ""bold action by innovative government - responsive to the people's needs and desires - is essential to the achievement of our national hopes."" - leonard woodcock, new york hearing, june , representative democracy fails when citizens cannot know: when public officials ignore or work against the principles of due process. how their public officials conduct the public's business. whether public officials have personal financial stakes in the very matters they are legislating, administering or enforcing, and what special interest pressures are being exerted on public officials by lobbyists. today, it is imperative that the democratic party again take the lead in reforming those practices that limit the responsiveness of government and remove it from the control of the people. seniority. the seniority system is one of the principal reasons that party platforms - and parties themselves - have lost meaning and importance in our political life. seniority has weakened congress as an effective and responsive institution in a changing society. it has crippled effective congressional leadership and made it impossible to present and enact a coherent legislative program. it has permitted the power of the democratic majority to be misused and abused. it has stifled initiative and wasted the talents of many members by making length of service the only criterion for selection to the vital positions of congressional power and leadership. we, therefore, call on the democratic members of the congress to use the powers inherent in their house and senate caucuses to implement the policies and programs of the national democratic party. it is specifically not intended that democratic members be directed how to vote on issues on the floor. but, in order that they be responsive to broad party policies and programs, we nonetheless call upon members of congress to: choose committee chairmen as provided in existing caucus rules and procedures, but by separate open ballot; chairpeople should be chosen who will carry out party policies and programs which come within the jurisdiction of their committees. assure that democratic programs and policies receive full and fair consideration and are brought to a vote in each house. discipline committee members, including chairpeople, who refuse to comply with caucus instructions, regarding the reporting of legislation from their committees, and withhold any seniority benefits from a member of congress who fails to overtly identify with the democratic organization in his state which is recognized by the national democratic party. secrecy. public business should be transacted publicly, except when national security might be jeopardized. to combat secrecy in government, we call on the democratic members of congress and state legislatures to: enact ""open meetings"" legislation, barring the practice of conducting the public business behind closed doors. this should include so-called mark-up sessions by legislative committees, but should allow for exceptions involving national security and invasions of privacy. to the extent possible, the same principle should apply to the executive branch. assure that all committee and floor votes are taken in open session, recorded individually for each legislator; record caucus votes, and make all of these votes available to the public. urge reservation of executive privilege for the president alone. urge that the judgment in the u.s. senate in a contested election case be rendered in open senate session. immediately strengthen the federal freedom of information act. congress should improve its oversight of executive secrecy by requiring federal agencies to report annually on every refusal to grant information requested under the act. citizens should have full recourse to the courts to deal with violation or circumvention of the act. it should be amended to allow courts to review the reasonableness of a claim of executive privilege, and administer the security system so as to limit the number of officials who can make a document secret, and provide for frequent declassification of documents. congress should be given the means to obtain documents necessary to fulfill its responsibilities. we also call on the democratic members of the house of representatives to take action through their caucuses to end the ""closed rule,"" which is used to prevent amendments and votes on vital tax matters and other important issues, and we call on the democratic members of the senate to liberalize the cloture rule, which is used to prevent votes in that body, so that after full and extensive debate majority rule can prevail. administrative agencies. there is, among more and more citizens, a growing revolt against large, remote and impersonal governmental agencies that are not responsive to human needs. we pledge to build a representative process into the executive branch, so that individuals affected by agency programs can be involved in formulating, implementing and revising them. this requires a basic restructuring of procedures -- public hearings before guidelines and regulations are handed down, the processing of citizen complaints, the granting of citizen standing and the recovery of litigation fees for those who win suits against the government. we recommend these specific changes in the rule-making and adjudication process of the federal government: there should be no non-written communication between an agency and outside parties about pending decisions. all written communications should promptly be made a part of the public record. all communications between government employees and outside parties about possible future action should be made a part of the public record. all government employees involved in rule-making and adjudication should be subject to conflict of interest laws. the justice department should make available to the public any consent decree days prior to its submission to court, to allow any interested party to comment on it to the court, and the justice department should report to congress each year, to explain its action on major suits. in addition, we must more effectively protect consumer rights before the government. the consumer must be made an integral part of any relationship between government and institutions (public or private) at every level of proceedings whether formal or informal. a democratic administration would instruct all federal agencies to identify american indians, asian americans and spanish-speaking americans in separate categories in all statistical data that note racial or ethnic heritage. only in this way can these americans be assured their rights under federal programs. finally, in appropriate geographical areas, agencies of the federal government should be equipped to conduct business in such a fashion that spanish-speaking citizens should not be hampered by language difficulties. conflict of interest. the public interest must not be sacrificed to personal gain. therefore, we call for legislation requiring full disclosure of the financial interests of members of congress and their staffs and high officials of the executive branch and independent agencies. disclosure should include business directorships held and associations with individuals or firms lobbying or doing business with the government. congress should forbid its members to engage in the practice of law or to retain association with a law firm while in office. legislators serving on a committee whose jurisdiction includes matters in which they have a financial interest should divest themselves of the interest or resign from the committee. campaign finance. a total overhaul of the present system of financing elections is a national necessity. candidates should not be dependent on large contributions who seek preferential treatment. we call for congressional action to provide for public financing of most election costs by . we recommend a statutory ceiling on political gifts at a reasonable limit. publicly opined communications facilities such as television, radio and the postal service should be made available, but on a limited basis, to candidates for federal office. regulation of lobbyists. we also call upon congress to enact rigorous lobbying disclosure legislation, to replace the present shockingly ineffective law. there should be full disclosure of all organized lobbying - including names of lobbyists, identity of the source of funds, total receipts and expenditures, the nature of the lobbying operation and specific target issues or bills. reports should be filed at least quarterly, with criminal penalties for late filing. lobbying regulations should cover attempts to influence both legislative and executive branch decisions. the legislation should specifically cover lobbying appeals in subscription publications. as a safeguard, we urge the availability of subpoena and cease-and-desist powers to enforce these conflict of interest, campaign financing and lobbying disclosure laws. we also affirm the citizens' right to seek enforcement through the courts, should public officials fail in enforcement. taking part in the political process. the presidential primary system today is an unacceptable patchwork. the democratic party supports federal laws that will embody the following principles: protect the opportunity for less-known candidates to build support. establish uniform ground rules. reduce the cost of primary campaigns. promote maximum voter turnout. ensure that issues are clarified. foster the selection of nominees with broad popular support to assure the continued viability of the two-party system. ensure every citizen the ability to take part in the presidential nomination process, and equalize the ability of people from all income levels to participate in the political decision-making processes of the democratic party, by providing financial assistance through party funds for delegates, alternates and standing committee members to state and national conventions. we also call for full and uniform enforcement of the voting rights act of . but further steps are needed to end all banners to participation in the political process: universal voter registration by post card. bilingual means of registration and voting. bilingual voter education programs. liberalized absentee voting. lower minimum age requirements for service in the senate and house of representatives. minimum residency requirements of days for all elections, including primaries. student voting where they attend school. study and review of the hatch act, to see what can be done to encourage good citizenship and reasonable participation by government employees. full home rule for the district of columbia, including an elected mayor-city council government, broad legislative power, control over appointments, automatic federal payment and voting representation in both houses of congress. no discriminatory districting. we favor a constitutional change to abolish the electoral college and to give every voter a direct and equal voice in presidential elections. the amendment should provide for a runoff election, if no candidate received more than percent of the popular vote. early ratification of the equal rights amendment to the constitution. appointment of women to positions of top responsibilities in all branches of the federal government, to achieve an equitable ratio of women and men. inclusion of women advisers in equitable ratios on all government studies, commissions and hearings, and laws authorizing federal grants on a matching basis for financing state commissions on the status of women. these changes in themselves will not solve the problems of government for all time. as our society changes, so must the ways we use to make government more responsive to the people. our challenge, today, as always, is to ensure that politics and institutions belong in spirit and in practice to all the people of our nation. in , americans are deciding that they want their country back again.","['new', 'directions', 'skepticism', 'cynicism', 'widespread', 'america', 'people', 'skeptical', 'platforms', 'filled', 'political', 'platitudes', 'promises', 'made', 'opportunistic',

Republican Party,1972,1970,rep_1972.csv,CSV,"PREAMBLE This year our Republican Party has greater reason than ever before for pride in its stewardship. When our accomplishments are weighed - when our opponents' philosophy, programs and candidates are assessed - we believe the American people will rally eagerly to the leadership which since January 1969 has brought them a better life in a better land in a safer world. This political contest of 1972 is a singular one. No Americans before have had a clearer option. The choice is between going forward from dramatic achievements to predictable new achievements, or turning back toward a nightmarish time in which the torch of free America was virtually snuffed out in a storm of violence and protest. It is so easy to forget how frightful it was. There was Vietnam - so bloody, so costly, so bitterly divisive - a war in which more than a half-million of America's sons had been committed to battle - a war, it seemed, neither to be won nor lost, but only to he endlessly fought - a war emotionally so tormenting as almost to obliterate America's other worldly concerns . And yet. as our eyes were fixed on the carnage in Asia, in Europe our alliance had weakened. The Western will was dividing and ebbing. The isolation of the People's Republic of China, with one-fourth of the world's population, went endlessly on. At home our horrified people watched our cities burn, crime burgeon, campuses dissolve into chaos. A mishmash of social experimentalism, producing such fiscal extravaganzas as the abortive war on poverty, combined with war pressures to drive up taxes and balloon the cost of living. Working men and women found their living standards fixed or falling, the victim of inflation. Nationwide, welfare skyrocketed out of control . The history of our country may record other crises more costly in material goods, but none so demoralizing to the American people. To millions of Americans it seemed we had lost our way. So it was when our Republican Party came to power. Now, four years later, a new leadership with new policies and new programs has restored reason and order and hope. No longer buffeted by internal violence and division, we are on course in calmer seas with a sure, steady hand at the helm. A new spirit, buoyant and confident, is on the rise in our land, nourished by the changes we have made. In the past four years:  We have turned toward concord among all Americans. We have turned toward reason and order. We have turned toward government responding sensitively and sensibly to the people's hopes and needs. We have turned toward innovative solutions to the nation's most pressing problems. We hare turned toward new paths for social progress - from welfare rolls to payrolls, from wanton pollution to vigorous environmental protection. We have moved far toward peace: withdrawal of our fighting men from Vietnam, constructive new relationships with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, the nuclear arms race checked, the Mid-East crisis dampened, our alliances revitalized. So once again the foreign policy of the United States is on a realistic footing, promising us a nation secure in a full generation of peace, promising the end of conscription, promising a further allocation of resources to domestic needs. It is a saga of exhilarating progress. We have come far in so short a time. Yet, much remains to be done. Discontents, frustrations and concerns still stir in the minds and hearts of many of our people, especially the young. As long as America falls short of being truly peaceful, truly prosperous, truly secure, truly just for all, her task is not done. Our encouragement is in the fact that things as they are, are far better than things that recently were. Our resolve is that things to come can be, and will be, better still. Looking to tomorrow, to President Nixon's second term and on into the third century of this Republic, we of the Republican Party see a quarter-billion Americans peaceful and prospering as never before, humane as never before, their nation strong and just as never before. It is toward this bright tomorrow that we are determined to move, in concert with millions of discerning Democrats and concerned Independents who will not, and cannot, take part in the convulsive leftward lurch of the national Democratic Party. The election of 1972 requires of the voters a momentous decision - one that will determine the kind of nation this is to be on its 200th birthday four years hence. In this year we must choose between strength and weakness for our country in the years to come. This year we must choose between negotiating and begging with adversary nations. This year we must choose between an expanding economy in which workers will prosper and a hand-out economy in which the idle live at ease. This year we must choose between running our own lives and letting others in a distant bureaucracy run them. This year we must choose between responsible fiscal policy and fiscal folly. This year the choice is between moderate goals historically sought by both major parties and far-out goals of the far left. The contest is not between the two great parties Americans have known in previous years. For in this year 1972 the national Democratic Party has been seized by a radical clique which scorns our nation's past and would blight her future. We invite our troubled friends of other political affiliations to join with us in a new coalition for progress. Together let us reject the New Left prescription for folly and build surely on the solid achievements of President Nixon's first term. Four years ago we said, in Abraham Lincoln's words, that Americans must think anew and act anew. This we have done, under gifted leadership. The many advances already made, the shining prospects so clearly ahead, are presented in this Platform for 1972 and beyond. May every American measure our deeds and words thoughtfully and objectively, and may our opponents' claims be equally appraised. Once this is done and judgment rendered on election day, we will confidently carry forward the task of doing for America what her people need and want and deserve. Toward A Full Generation of Peace FOREIGN POLICY When Richard Nixon became President, our country was still clinging to foreign policies fashioned for the era immediately following World War II. The world had changed dramatically in the 1960's, but our foreign policies had not. America was hopelessly enmeshed in Vietnam. In all parts of the globe our alliances were frayed. With the principal Communist powers our relations showed little prospect of improvement. Trade and monetary problems were grave. Periodic crises had become the way of international economic life. The nation's frustrations had fostered a dangerous spirit of isolationism among our people. America's influence in the world had waned. In only four years we have fashioned foreign policies based on a new spirit of effective negotiation with our adversaries, and a new sense of real partnership with our allies. Clearly, the prospects for lasting peace are greater today than at any time since World War II. New Era of Diplomacy. Not all consequences of our new foreign policy are yet visible precisely because one of its great purposes is to anticipate crises and avoid them rather than merely respond. Its full impact will be realized over many years, but already there are vivid manifestations of its success. Before this Administration, a Presidential visit to Peking would have been unthinkable. Yet our President has gone there to open a candid airing of differences so that they will not lead some day to war. All over the world tensions have eased as, after a generation of hostility, the strongest of nations and the most populous of nations have started discoursing again. During the 1960's, Presidential visits to Moscow were twice arranged and twice cancelled. Now our President has conferred, in the Soviet Union, with Soviet leaders, and has hammered out agreements to make this world a much safer place. Our President's quest for peace has taken him to 20 other countries, including precedent-shattering visits to Rumania, Yugoslavia and Poland. Around the globe America's alliances have been renewed and strengthened. A new spirit of partnership shows results m our NATO partners' expenditures for the common defense - up by some $2-billion in two years. Historians may well regard these years as a golden age of American diplomacy. Never before has our country negotiated with so many nations on so wide a range of subjects - and never with greater success. In the last four years we have concluded agreements:  To limit nuclear weapons. To ban nuclear weapons from the world's seabeds. To reduce the risk of an accidental nuclear war. To end the threat of biological and toxin warfare. To terminate American responsibility for the administration of Okinawa. To end the recurrent crises over Berlin. To provide for U.S.-Soviet cooperation in health and space research. To reduce the possibility of dangerous incidents at sea. To improve emergency communication between the White House and the Kremlin. To exercise restraint in situations threatening conflict. To realign the world's currencies. To reduce barriers to American exports. To combat the international drug traffic. To protect the international environment. To expand cultural relations with peoples of Eastern Europe. To settle boundary disputes with Mexico. To restore the water quality of the Great Lakes in cooperation with Canada. In Vietnam, too, our new policies have been dramatically effective. In the 1960's, our nation was plunged into another major war - for the fourth time in this century, the third time in a single generation. More than a half-million Americans were fighting in Vietnam in January 1969. Fatalities reached 562 in a single week. There was no plan for bringing Americans home, no hope for an end of the war. In four years, we have marched toward peace and away from war. Our forces in Vietnam have been cut by 93 percent. No longer do we have a single ground combat unit there. Casualties are down by 95 percent. Our young draftees are no longer sent there without their consent. Through it all, we have not abandoned an ally to aggression, not turned our back on their brave defense against brutal invasion, not consigned them to the bloodbath that would follow Communist conquest. By helping South Vietnam build a capability to withstand aggression, we have laid the foundation for a just peace and a durable peace in Southeast Asia. From one sector of the globe to another, a sure and strong America, in partnership with other nations, has once again resumed her historic mission - the building of a lasting peace. The Nixon Doctrine. When President Nixon came into office, America's foremost problem was the bloody, costly, divisive involvement in Vietnam. But there was an even more profound task - to redefine the international role of the United States in light of new realities around the globe and new attitudes at home. Precisely and clearly, the President stated a new conception of a positive American role. This - the Nixon Doctrine - is monumentally important to every American and to all other people in the world. The theme of this Doctrine is that America will remain fully involved in world affairs, and yet do this in ways that will elicit greater effort by other nations and the sustaining support of our people. For decades, our nation's leaders regarded virtually every problem of local defense or economic development any place in the world as an exclusive American responsibility. The Nixon Doctrine recognizes that continuing defense and development are impossible unless the concerned nations shoulder the principal burden. Yet strong economic and military assistance programs remain essential. Without these, we are denied a middle course - the course between abruptly leaving allies to struggle along against economic stagnation or aggression, or intervening massively ourselves. We cannot move from the over-involvement of the Sixties to the selective involvement of the Seventies if we do not assist our friends to make the transition with us. In the Nixon Doctrine, therefore, we define our interests and commitments realistically and clearly; we offer not an abdication of leadership, but more rational and responsible leadership. We pledge that, under Republican leadership, the United States will remain a leader in international affairs. We will continue to shape our involvement abroad to national objectives and realities in order to sustain a strong, effective American role in the world. Over time we hope this role will eventually lead the peace-loving nations to undertake an exhaustive, coordinated analysis of the root causes of war and the most promising paths of peace, so that those causes may in time be removed and the prospects for enduring peace strengthened year by year. Peace in the 1970's. We stand with our President for his Strategy for Peace - a strategy of national strength, a new sense of international partnership, a willingness to negotiate international differences. We will strengthen our relationships with our allies, recognizing them as full-fledged partners in securing the peace and promoting the common well-being. With our adversaries, we will continue to negotiate in order to improve our security, reduce tension, and extend the realm of cooperation. Especially important is continued negotiation to maintain the momentum established by the Strategic Arms Limitation agreements to limit offensive and defensive nuclear weapons systems and further to reduce the danger of nuclear conflict. In addition, we will encourage increased trade for the benefit of our consumers, businessmen, workers, and farmers. Along with NATO allies, we will seek agreement with the Warsaw Pact nations on a mutual and balanced reduction of military forces in Europe. We will press for expansion of contacts with the people of Eastern Europe and the People's Republic of China, so long isolated from most of the world. We will continue to seek a settlement of the Vietnam war which will permit the people of Southeast Asia to live in peace under political arrangements of their own choosing. We take note of the remaining major obstacle to settlement - Hanoi s demand that the United States overthrow the Saigon government and impose a Communist-dominated government on the South Vietnamese. We stand unequivocally at the side of the President in his effort to negotiate honorable terms, and in his refusal to accept terms which would dishonor this country. We commend his refusal to perform this act of betrayal - and we most emphatically say the President of the United States should not go begging to Hanoi. We believe that the Presidents proposal to withdraw remaining American forces from Vietnam four months after an internationally supervised ceasefire has gone into effect throughout Indochina and all prisoners have been returned is as generous an offer as can be made by anyone - by anyone, that is, who is not bemused with surrender - by anyone who seeks, not a fleeting peace at whatever cost, but real peace that will be both just and lasting. We will keep faith with American prisoners of war held by the enemy, and we will keep faith, too, with their families here at home who have demonstrated remarkable courage and fortitude over long periods of uncertainty. We will never agree to leave the fate of our men unclear, dependent upon a cruel enemy's whim. On the contrary - we insist that, before all American forces are withdrawn from Vietnam, American prisoners must he returned and a full accounting made of the missing in action and of those who have died in enemy hands. We pledge that upon repatriation our returned prisoners will be received in a manner befitting their valor and sacrifice. We applaud the Administration's program to assure each returned prisoner the finest medical care, personal counseling, social services and career orientation. This around-the-clock personal service will ease their reintegration into American life. North Vietnam's violation of the Geneva Convention in its treatment of our prisoners of war has called forth condemnation from leaders around the world - but not by our political opposition at home. We denounce the enemy's flagrant breach of international law and common decency. We will continue to demand full implementation of the rights of the prisoners. If North Vietnam continues obdurately to reject peace by negotiation we shall nevertheless achieve peace for our country through the successful program of Vietnamization, phasing out our involvement as our ally strengthens his defense against aggression. In the Middle East, we initiated arrangements leading to a cease-fire which has prevailed for two years. We pledge very effort to transform the cease-fire into lasting peace. Since World War II, our country has played the major role in the international effort to assist the developing countries of the world. Reform of our foreign assistance program to induce a greater international sharing of the aid effort, is long overdue The reforms proposed by the President have been approved only in part. We call for further reforms to make our aid more effective and protect the taxpayer's interests. We stand for an equitable, non-discriminatory immigration policy, reaffirming our support of the principles of the 1965 Immigration Act - non-discrimination against national origins, renunciation of families, and the selective admission of the specially talented. The immigration process must be just and orderly, and we will increase our efforts to halt the illegal entry of aliens into the United States. We also pledge to strengthen the agencies of international cooperation. We will help multilateral organizations focus on international issues affecting the quality of life - for example the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and the protection of man's cultural heritage and freedom of communication, as well as drug abuse, pollution, overpopulation, exploitation of the sea and seabeds, aircraft hijacking and international crime. We will seek to improve the performance of the United Nations, including more objective leadership. We support a more equitable sharing of the costs of international organizations and have serious concerns over the delinquency of many UN members in meeting their financial obligations. Our country, which from its beginnings has proclaimed that all men are endowed with certain rights, cannot be indifferent to the denial of human rights anywhere in the world. We deplore oppression and persecution, the inevitable hallmarks of despotic systems of rule. We will continue to strive to bring them to an end, both to reestablish the rights of self-determination and to encourage where and when possible the political freedom of subjugated peoples everywhere in the world. We firmly support the right of all persons to emigrate from any country, and we have consistently upheld that doctrine. We are fully aware of and share the concern of many citizens for the plight of Soviet Jews with regard to their freedoms and emigration. This view, together with our commitment to the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations, was made known to Soviet leaders during the President's discussions in Moscow. The Middle East. We support the right of Israel and its courageous people to survive and prosper in peace. We have sought a stable peace for the Middle East and helped to obtain a cease-fire which contained the tragic convict. We will help in any way possible to bring Israel and the Arab states to the conference table, where they may negotiate a lasting peace. We will continue to act to prevent the development of a military imbalance which would imperil peace in the region and elsewhere by providing Israel with support essential for her security, including aircraft, training and modem and sophisticated military equipment, and also by helping friendly Arab governments and peoples, including support for their efforts to diminish their dependence on outside powers. We support programs of economic assistance to Israel pursued by President Nixon that have helped her achieve a nine percent annual economic growth rate. This and the special refugee assistance ordered by the President have also helped to provide resettlement for the thousands of immigrants seeking refuge in Israel. We will maintain our tactical forces in Europe and the Mediterranean area at adequate strength and high levels of efficiency. The irresponsible proposals of our political opposition to slash the defense forces of the United States specifically, by cutting the strength of our fleet, by reducing our aircraft carriers from 16 to six and by unilateral withdrawals from Europe - would increase the threat of war in the Middle East and gravely menace Israel. We flatly reject these dangerous proposals. With a settlement fair to all nations of the Middle East, there would be an opportunity for their peoples to look ahead to shared opportunities rather than backward to rancorous animosities. In a new environment of cooperation, Israel will be able to contribute much to economic renaissance in the Mid-East crossroads of the world. The Atlantic Community. We place high priority on the strengthening of the North Atlantic Alliance. One of the President's first initiatives was to visit Western European capitals to reinvigorate the NATO alliance and indicate its importance in U.S. foreign policy. Right now, with plaintive cries of ""come home America"" echoing a new isolationism, the Republican Party states its firm belief that no nation can be an island or a fortress unto itself. Now, more than ever, there is need for interdependence among proven friends and old allies. The North Atlantic Alliance remains the strongest, most successful peacetime association ever formed among a group of free nations. The continued strengthening of the Alliance will remain an important element in the foreign policies of the second Nixon administration. Japan. During the 1960's a number of economic and political issues developed in our country's relations with Japan, our major ally in Asia. To resolve these, President Nixon terminated our responsibility for the administration of Okinawa and initiated action to reduce our trade deficit with Japan. We are consulting closely to harmonize our two countries' separate efforts to normalize relations with Peking. In these ways we have shifted our vital alliance with Japan to a more sustainable basis for the long term, recognizing that the maintenance of United States-Japanese friendship advances the interests of both countries. The Soviet Union. Over many years our relations with the Soviet Union have oscillated between superficial improvements and new crises. False hopes have been repeatedly followed by disillusioned confrontation. In the closing months of 1968, our relations with the Soviet Union deteriorated steadily, forcing the cancellation of a scheduled Presidential visit to Moscow and immobilizing projected negotiations on strategic arms limitation. President Nixon immediately began the difficult task of building a new relationship - one based on a realistic acceptance of the profound differences in the values and systems of our two nations. He moved decisively on key issues - such as the Berlin problem and strategic arms limitation - so that progress in one area would add momentum to progress in other areas. The success of these efforts was demonstrated at the summit in Moscow. Agreements were reached on new areas of cooperation - public health, environmental control, space exploration and trade. The first historic agreements limiting strategic arms were signed last May 26 in Moscow, and the Soviet Union subscribed to a broad declaration of principles governing our relations. We pledge to build upon these promising beginnings in reorienting relations between the world's strongest nuclear powers to establish a truly lasting peace. China. In the 1960's it seemed beyond possibility that the United States could dispel the ingrained hostility and confrontation with the China mainland. President Nixon's visit to the People's Republic of China was, therefore, an historic milestone in his effort to transform our era from one of confrontation to one of negotiation. While profound differences remain between the United States and China, at least a generation of hostility has been replaced by frank discussions. In February 1972 rules of international conduct were agreed upon which should make the Pacific region a more peaceful area now and in the future. Both the People's Republic and the United States affirmed the usefulness of promoting trade and cultural exchanges as ways of improving understanding between our two peoples. All this is being done without affecting our mutual defense treaty or our continued diplomatic relations with our valued friend and ally on Taiwan, the Republic of China. Latin America. Our common long-range interests, as well as history and geography, give the relations among nations of the Western Hemisphere a special importance. We will foster a more mature partnership among the nations of this hemisphere, with a wider sharing of ideas and responsibility, a broader understanding of diversities, and firm commitment to the common pursuit of economic progress and social justice. We believe the continuing campaign by Cuba to foment violence and support subversion in other countries makes it ineligible for readmission to the community of American states. We look forward to the day when changes in Cuba's policies will justify its re-entry into the American community - and to the day when the Cuban people achieve again their freedom and their true independence. Africa. Our ties with Africa are rooted in the heritage of many Americans and in our historic commitment to self-determination. We respect the hard earned sovereignty of Africa's new states and will continue to do our utmost to make a meaningful contribution to their development. We have no illusions that the United States can single-handedly solve the seemingly intractable problems of apartheid and minority rule, but we can and will encourage non-violent, evolutionary change by supporting international efforts peacefully to resolve the problems of southern Africa and by maintaining our contacts with all races on the Continent. DEFENSE We believe in keeping America strong. In times past, both major parties shared that belief. Today this view is under attack by militants newly in control of the Democratic Party. To the alarm of free nations everywhere, the New Democratic Left now would undercut our defenses and have America retreat into virtual isolation, leaving us weak in a world still not free of aggression and threats of aggression. We categorically reject this slash-now, beg-later approach to defense policy. Only a strong America can safely negotiate with adversaries. Only a strong America can fashion partnerships for peace. President Nixon has given the American people their best opportunity in this century to achieve lasting peace. The foundations are well laid. By adhering to a defense policy based on strength at home, partnership abroad and a willingness to negotiate everywhere, we hold that lasting peace is now achievable. We will surely fail if we go crawling to the conference table. Military weakness is not the path to peace; it is invitation to war. A Modern, Well-Equipped Force. We believe that the first prerequisite of national security is a modem, well-equipped armed force. From 1965 to 1969 the Vietnam war so absorbed the resources of the Defense Department that maintenance, modernization. and research and development fell into neglect. In the late 1960's the Soviet Union outspent the United States by billions of dollars for force modernization, facing the United States with the dangerous prospect that its forces would soon be qualitatively inferior. Our Reserve Forces and the National Guard had become a dumping ground for castoff arms and equipment. The military posture of our country became seriously undermined. To assure our strength and counter the mounting Soviet threat, President Nixon directed:  The most significant ship construction and modernization program since World War II; The development of new types of tactical aircraft such as the F-15, a lightweight fighter, and a fighter plane for close support of ground troops;  Improvements in our strategic bomber force and development of the new B-1 strategic bomber; Development of a new TRIDENT submarine and undersea missile system; Greatly increasing the capability of existing strategic missiles through multiple warheads; Strengthening of strategic defenses, including initial deployment of an anti-ballistic missile system; The largest research and development budget in history to ensure continued technological superiority; Equipping of the National Guard and Reserves with the most modern and sophisticated weapons; Improved command and control communications systems. We draw a sharp distinction between prudent reductions in defense spending and the meat-ax slashes with which some Americans are not beguiled by the political opposition. Specifically, we oppose plans to stop the Minuteman III and Poseidon programs, reduce the strategic bomber force by some 60 percent, cancel the B-1 bomber, reduce aircraft carriers from 16 to 6, reduce tactical air wings by a third, and unilaterally reduce U.S. forces in Europe by half. These slashes are worse than misguided; they are dangerous. They would torpedo negotiations on arms and troop reductions, create a crisis of confidence with our allies, damage our own industrial and technological capacity, destabilize Europe and the Middle East, and directly endanger the nation's security. A New Partnership. The Nixon Doctrine has led to a new military strategy of realistic deterrence. Its essence is the sharing of the responsibilities and the burdens of defense. This strategy is based on the efficient utilization of the total force available -- our own and our allies', and our civilian reserve elements as well as our regular forces. For years our country shouldered the responsibility for the defense of other nations. There were fears that we were attempting to be the policemen of the world. Our country found it necessary to maintain a military force of 3.5 million persons more than a million overseas at 2,270 installations. A new partnership is emerging between the United States and other nations of the free world. Other countries are assuming a much greater responsibility for the common defense. Twice in the last two years our European allies have agreed to substantial increases in their support for NATO forces. In Asia we have been heartened by the efforts of the Koreans, Vietnamese, Thais, Nationalist Chinese, Australians, New Zealanders and others who have sought improvements in their own forces. We have been able to reduce our military forces by more than one million men and women. We have cut by half the number deployed overseas, reduced overseas installations by more than 10 percent, and sharply reduced the economic burden of defense spending from the Vietnam high. All this has been done by virtue of our new security posture, without impairing our own or our allies' security. We pledge to press on toward a lasting peace. To that end we declare ourselves unalterably opposed to a unilateral slash of our military power, and we reject a whimpering ""come back America"" retreat into isolationism. An All-Volunteer Armed Force. We wholeheartedly support an all-volunteer armed force and are proud of our historic initiatives to bring it to pass. Four years ago, the President pledged to work toward an early end of the draft. That promise has been kept. Today we approach a zero draft that will enlarge the personal freedom of millions of young Americans. Prior to 1969, annual draft calls exceeded 300,000. The Selective Service System was inequitable in operation, and its rules caused prolonged uncertainty for young men awaiting call. Since 1969, the Selective Service System has been thoroughly reorganized, and local draft boards are more representative than ever before. Today draftees are called by random selection of the youngest first, so that the maximum length of vulnerability is no longer seven years but one year only. Youth advisor committees are in operation all across the country. Of critical importance, we are nearing the elimination of draft calls altogether. In every year since 1968, draft calls have been reduced. Monthly draft calls are now down to a few thousand, and no draftees are sent involuntarily to Vietnam. We expect to achieve our goal by July, 1973. Then, for the first time in a quarter-century, we hope and expect that young Americans of all ages will be free from conscription. Our political opponents have talked for years of their concern for young people. It is our Republican Administration that has taken the strong, effective action required to end the draft, with its many hardships and uncertainties for the youth of America. Improvements in Service Life. We believe that the men and women in the uniformed services deserve the gratitude and respect of all Americans and are entitled to better treatment than received in the past. For years most servicemen have been underpaid, harassed with restrictions, and afforded few opportunities for self-development. Construction of military housing was allowed to fall badly behind. Since 1968 improvements in service life have been many and major:  The largest pay raises in military history have been enacted. While increases have been in all grades, the largest have gone to new recruits whose base pay will have risen more than 300 percent by the end of this year. Construction of new housing for military personnel and their families have increased sixfold since January 1969. Without sacrificing discipline, needlessly harsh, irksome and demeaning practices of the past have been abandoned. An effective program against dangerous drugs has been initiated. Educational and training opportunities have been expanded. Major strides have been made toward wiping out the last vestiges of racial discrimination. We regard these tasks as never completed, but we are well on the way and pledge ourselves to press forward assuring all men and women in the armed forces rewarding careers. Better Defense Management. In the 1960's, the Department of Defense became administratively top-heavy and inefficient. The acquisition of new weapons systems was handled with inadequate attention to cost or performance, and there was little recognition of the human dimensions of the Department. Morale was low. Our improvements have been many and substantial. Healthy decentralization has taken place. The methods of acquiring new weapons systems have been reformed by such procedures as ""fly before you buy,"" the use of prototypes and the elimination of frills. Service personnel and civilian employees are now treated as the most important asset of the Department. We have sharply reduced defense spending. In 1968, 45 percent of the Federal budget was spent for defense and 32 percent for human resources. In the 1973 budget the proportions were reversed - 45 percent for human resources, 32 percent for defense. The 1973 defense budget imposes the smallest economic burden on the country of any defense budget in more than 20 years, consuming only 6.4 percent of the estimated Gross National Product. Arms Limitation. We believe in limiting arms - not unilaterally. but by mutual agreement and with adequate safeguards. When the Nixon Administration began, the Soviet Union was rapidly building its strategic armaments, and any effort to negotiate limitations on such weapons seemed hopeless. The Soviet build-up threatened the efficacy of our strategic deterrent. The Nixon years have achieved a great breakthrough in the long-term effort to curb major armaments by international agreement and given new momentum to arms limitations generally. Of greatest importance were agreements with the Soviet leaders to limit offensive and defensive nuclear weapons. The SALT accord established mutually agreed restraints between the United States and the Soviet Union and reduced tensions throughout the world. With approval of the SALT agreements by the Congress, negotiations will be resumed to place further restrictions on nuclear weapons, and talks will begin on mutual, balanced force reductions in Europe. We believe it is imperative that these negotiations go forward under President Nixon's continuing leadership. We pledge him our full support. For the Future. We will continue the sound military policies laid down by the President - our policies which guard our interests but do not dissipate our resources in vain efforts to police the world. As stated by the President:  We will maintain a nuclear deterrent adequate to meet any threat to the security of the United States or of our allies. We will help other nations develop the capability of defending themselves. We will faithfully honor all of our treaty commitments. We will act to defend our interests whenever and wherever they are threatened. But where our vital interests or treaty commitments are not involved our role will be limited. We are proud of the men and women who wear our country's uniform, especially of those who have borne the burden of fighting a difficult and unpopular war. Here and now we reject all proposals to grant amnesty to those who have broken the law by evading military service. We reject the claim that those who fled are more deserving, or obeyed a higher morality, than those next in line who served in their places. In carrying out our defense policies, we pledge to maintain at all times the level of military strength required to deter conflict, to honor our commitments to our allies, and to protect our people and vital interests against all foreign threats. We will not let America become a second-class power, dependent for survival on the good will of adversaries. We will continue to pursue arms control agreements - but we recognize that this can be successful only if we maintain sufficient strength and will fail if we allow ourselves to slip into inferiority. A New Prosperity JOBS, INFLATION AND THE ECONOMY The goal of our Party is prosperity, widely-shared, sustainable in peace. We stand for full employment - a job for everyone willing and able to work in an economy freed of inflation, its vigor not dependent upon war or massive military spending. Under the President's leadership our country is once again moving toward these peacetime goals. We have checked the inflation which had started to skyrocket when our Administration took office. making the difficult transition from inflation toward price stability and from war toward peace. We have brought about a rapid rise in both employment and in real income, and laid the basis for a continuing decline in the rate of unemployment. All Americans painfully recall the grave economic troubles we faced in January 1969. The Federal budget in fiscal 1968 had a deficit of more than $25 billion even though the economy was operating at capacity. Predictably, consumer prices soared by an annual rate of 6.6 percent in the first quarter of 1969. ""Jawboning"" of labor and business had utterly failed. The inevitable tax increase had come too late. The kaleidoscope of ""Great Society"" programs added to the inflationary fires. Our international competitive position slumped from a trade surplus of $7 billion in 1964 to $800 million in 1968. Foreign confidence in the value of the dollar plummeted. Strategies and Achievements. Our Administration took these problems head on, accepting the unpopular tasks of holding down the budget, extending the temporary tax surcharge, and checking inflation. We welcomed the challenge of reorienting the economy from war to peace, as the more than two and one-half million Americans serving the military or working in defense-related industries had to be assimilated in the peacetime work force. At the same time, we kept the inflation fight and defense employment cuts from triggering a recession. The struggle to restore the health of our nation's economy required a variety of measures. Most important, the Administration developed and applied sound economic and monetary policies which provided the fundamental thrust against inflation. To supplement these basic policies, Inflation Alerts were published; a new National Commission on Productivity enlisted labor, business and public leaders against inflation and in raising real incomes through increased output per worker: proposed price increases in lumber, petroleum, steel and other commodities were modified. A new Construction Industry Stabilization Committee, with the cooperation of unions and management, braked the dangerously skyrocketing costs in the construction industry. Positive results from these efforts were swift and substantial. The rate of inflation, more than 6 percent in early 1969, declined to less than 4 percent in early 1971. Even so, the economic damage inflicted by past excesses had cut so deeply as to make a timely recovery impossible forcing the temporary use of wage and price controls. These controls were extraordinary measures, not needed in a healthy free economy, but needed temporarily to recapture lost stability. Our mix of policies has worked. The nation's economic growth is once again strong and steady. The rate of increase of consumer prices is now down to 2.7 percent. On the employment front, expenditures for manpower pro. grams were increased from $2.3 billion to a planned $5.1 billion; new enrollees receiving training or employment under these programs were increased by more than half a million; computerized job banks were established in all cities; more than a million young people received jobs this summer through Federal programs, 50 percent more than last year; engineers, scientists and technicians displaced by defense reductions were given assistance under the nationwide Technology Mobilization and Reemployment program; 13 additional weeks of unemployment compensation were authorized; and a Special Revenue Sharing Program for Manpower was proposed to train more people for more jobs - a program still shelved by the opposition Congress. Civilian employment increased at an annual rate of about 2.4 million from August 1971 to July 1972. Almost four and one-half million new civilian jobs have been added since President Nixon took office, and total employment is at its highest level in history. The total productive output of the country increased at an annual rate of 9.4 percent in the second quarter of 1972, the highest in many years. Workers' real weekly take-home pay - the real value left after taxes and inflation - is increasing at an annual rate of 4.5 percent, compared to less than one percent from 1960 to 1970. For the first time in six years real spendable income is going up, while the rate of inflation has been cut in half. Time lost from strikes is at the lowest level in many years. The rate of unemployment has been reduced from 6.1 percent to 5.5 percent, lower than the average from 1961 through 1964 before the Vietnam buildup began, and is being steadily driven down. In negotiation with other countries we have revalued the dollar relative to other currencies, helping to increase sales at home and abroad and increasing the number of jobs. We have initiated a reform of the international monetary and trading system and made clear our determination that this reform must lead to a strong United States position in the balance of trade and payments. The Road Ahead. We will continue to pursue sound economic policies that will eliminate inflation, further cut unemployment, raise real incomes, and strengthen our international economic position. We will fight for responsible Federal budgets to help assure steady expansion of the economy without inflation. We will support the independent Federal Reserve Board in a policy of non-inflationary monetary expansion. We have already removed some temporary controls on wages and prices and will remove them all once the economic distortions spawned in the late 1960's are repaired. We are determined to return to an unfettered economy at the earliest possible moment. We affirm our support for the basic principles of capitalism which underline the private enterprise system of the United States. At a time when a small but dominant faction of the opposition Party is pressing for radical economic schemes which so often have failed around the world, we hold that nothing has done more to help the American people achieve their unmatched standard of living than the free enterprise system. It is our conviction that government of itself cannot produce the benefits to individuals that flow from our unique combination of labor, management and capital. We will continue to promote steady expansion of the whole economy as the best route to a long-term solution of unemployment. Ate will devote every effort to raising productivity, primarily to raise living standards but also to hold down costs and pried and to increase the ability of American producers and workers to compete in world markets. In economic policy decisions, including tax revisions, we will emphasize incentives to work, innovate and invest; and research and development will have our full support. We are determined to improve Federal manpower programs to reduce unemployment and increase productivity by providing better information on job openings and more relevant job training. Additionally we reaffirm our commitment to removing barriers to a full life for the mentally and physically handicapped, especially the barriers to rewarding employment. We commit ourselves to the full educational opportunities and the humane care, treatment and rehabilitation services necessary for the handicapped to become fully integrated into the social and economic mainstream. We will press on for greater competition in our economy. The energetic antitrust program of the past four years demonstrates our commitment to free competition as our basic policy. The Antitrust Division has moved decisively to invalidate those ""conglomerate"" mergers which stifle competition and discourage economic concentration. The 87 antitrust cases filed in fiscal year 1979 broke the previous one-year record of more than a decade ago, during another Republican Administration. We will pursue the start we have made for reform of the international monetary and trading system, insisting on fair and equal treatment. Since the 1930's, it has been illegal for United States citizens to own gold. We believe it is time to reconsider that policy. The right of American citizens to buy, hold, or sell gold should be reestablished as soon as this is feasible. Review of the present policy should, of course, take account of our basic objective of achieving a strengthened world monetary system. TAXES AND GOVERNMENT SPENDING We pledge to spread the tax burden equitably, to spend the Federal revenues prudently, to guard against waste in spending, to eliminate unnecessary programs, and to make sure that each dollar spent for essential government services buys a dollar's worth of value. Federal deficit spending beyond the balance of the full employment budget is one sure way to refuel inflation, and the prime source of such spending is the United States Congress. Because of its present procedures and particularly because of its present political leadership, Congress is not handling Federal fiscal policies in a responsible manner. The Congress now permits its legislative committees - instead of its fiscal committees - to decide, independently of each other, how much should be devoted to individual programs. Total Federal spending Is thus haphazard and uncontrolled. We pledge vigorous efforts to reform the Congressional budgeting process. As an immediate first step, we believe the Nation needs a rigid spending ceiling on Federal outlays each fiscal year - a ceiling controlling both the executive branch and the Congress - as President Nixon strongly recommended when he submitted his fiscal 1973 budget. Should the total of all appropriations exceed the ceiling, some or all of them would be reduced by Executive action to bring the total within the ceiling. Our tax system needs continual, timely reform. Early in this Administration we achieved the first comprehensive tax reform since 1954. The record shows that as a result of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 and the Revenue Act of 1971:  9 5 million low-income Americans are removed from the Federal income tax rolls. Persons in the lowest income tax bracket will pay 82 percent less this year than they would have paid, had the 1969 and 1971 tax reforms not been enacted; those in the $10,000 to $15,000 income range will pay 18 percent less, and those with incomes above $100,000 will pay about 7 percent more. This year the tax reduction for a family of four earning $7,500 a year will be $270. In this fiscal year individual taxpayers will pay $22 billion less in Federal income taxes than they would have paid if the old tax rates and structures were still in force. The tax disadvantage of single taxpayers is sharply reduced and we urge further changes to assure full equality. Working parents can now deduct more of their costs for the care of their children during working hours. The seven percent automobile excise tax is repealed, saving the new car buyer an average of $200 and creating more jobs in that part of the economy.  This is sound tax reform, the kind that more equitably spreads the tax burden and avoids incentive-destroying tax levels which would cripple the economy and put people out of work. We reject the deceitful tax ""reform"" cynically represented as one that would soak the rich, but in fact one that would sharply raise the taxes of millions of families in middle-income brackets as well. We reject as well the lavish spending promised by the opposition Party which would more than double the present budget of the United States Government. This. too, would cause runaway inflation or force heavy increases in personal taxes. Taxes and government spending are inseparable. Only if the taxpayers' money is prudently managed can taxes be kept at reasonable levels. When our Administration took office, Federal spending had been mounting at an average annual rate of 17 percent - a rate we have cut almost in half. We urge the Congress to serve all Americans by cooperating with the President in his efforts to curb increases in federal spending - increases which will ordain more taxes or more inflation. Since 1969 we have eliminated over $5 billion of spending on unneeded domestic and defense programs. This large saving would have been larger still, had Congress passed the Federal Economy Act of 1970 which would have discontinued other programs. We pledge to continue our efforts to purge the Government of these wasteful activities. Tax reform must continue. During the next session of Congress we pledge:  To pursue such policies as Revenue Sharing that will allow property tax relief; Further tax reform to ensure that the tax burden is fairly shared; A simplified tax system to make it easier for all of us to pay no more and no less than we rightly owe; Prudent fiscal management, including the elimination of unnecessary or obsolete programs, to keep the tax burden to a minimum. INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICY In tandem with our foreign policy innovations, we have transformed our international economic policy into a dynamic instrument to advance the interests of farmers, workers, businessmen and consumers. These efforts are designed to make the products of American workers and farmers more competitive in the world. Within the last year we achieved the Smithsonian Agreements which revalued our currency, making our exports more competitive with those of our major trading partners, and we pledge continuing negotiations further to reform the international monetary system. We also established negotiations to expand foreign market access for products produced by United States workers, with further comprehensive negotiations committed for 1973. As part of our effort to begin a new era of negotiations, we are expanding trade opportunities and the jobs related to them for American workers and businessmen. The President's Summit negotiations, for example, yielded an agreement for the Soviet purchase, over a three-year period, of a minimum of $750 million in United States grains - the largest long-term commercial trade purchase agreement ever made between two nations. This amounts to a 17 percent increase in grain exports by United States farmers. A U.S.-Soviet Commercial Commission has been established, and negotiations are now underway as both countries seek a general expansion of trade. As we create a more open world market for American exports, we are not unmindful of dangers to American workers and industries from severe and rapid dislocation by changing patterns of trade. We have several agreements to protect these workers and industries - for example, for steel, beef, textiles and shoes. These actions, highly important to key American industries, were taken in ways that avoided retaliation by our trading partners and the resultant loss of American jobs. As part of this adjustment process, we pledge improvement of the assistance offered by government to facilitate readjustment on the part of workers, businessmen and affected communities. In making the world trading system a fairer one, we have vigorously enforced anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws to make them meaningful deterrents to foreign producers who would compete unfairly. The growth of multinational corporations poses both new problems and new opportunities in trade and investment areas. We pledge to ensure that international investment problems are dealt with fairly and effectively - including consideration of effects on jobs, expropriation and treatment of investors, as well as equitable principles of taxation. At the same time that we seek a better environment for American exports, we must improve our productivity and competitiveness. We must have a strong domestic economy with increased investment in new plants and equipment and an advancing technology. We pledge increased efforts to promote export opportunities, including coordination of tax policy and improved export financing techniques - designed to make America more competitive in exporting. Of critical importance will be new legislative proposals to equip American negotiators with the tools for constructing an open and fair world trading system. We deplore the practice of locating plants in foreign countries solely to take advantage of low wage rates in order to produce goods primarily for sale in the United States. We will take action to discourage such unfair and disruptive practices that result in the loss of American jobs. SMALL BUSINESS Small business, so vital to our economic system is free enterprise in its purest sense. It holds forth opportunity to the individual, regardless of race and color, to fulfill the American dream. The seed bed of innovation and invention, it is the starting point of many of the country's large businesses, and today its role in our increasingly technological economy is crucial. We pledge to sustain and expand that role. We have translated this philosophy into many beneficial actions. Primarily through the Small Business Administration, we have delivered financial assistance to small business at a dramatically increasing rate. Today small business is receiving double the SBA funds it was receiving when our Administration took office. During the 1970-72 fiscal years the Agency loaned small business $3.3-billion - 40 percent of the total amount loaned in the entire 19-year history of the Small Business Administration. Financial help to minorities has been more than tripled, and now more than 17 percent of the SBA dollar goes to minority business. Procurement of Federal contracts for small business has surged above $12 billion. In his first year in office, the President established a Task Force to discover ways in which the prospects of the small businessman could be improved. The findings, reported to Congress, were followed by legislative proposals to give small business tax and interest advantages, to provide incentives for more participation in small business, to make venture capital and long-term credit easier to obtain, and to open the doors for disadvantaged minorities to go into business for themselves. Some of these measures have been signed into law. Others are still in the hands of the indifferent opposition in control of Congress. The results of our efforts have been significant. Today small business is once again gaining ground. Incorporations are at a record level and the number of business failures is dropping. The current new growth of small business is about 100,000 units a year. For tomorrow, the challenges are many. We will:  Continue to fill the capital gap in the small business community by increasing SBA financing to upwards of $3 billion next year. Provide more incentives for the private sector to join with SBA in direct action programs, such as lease guarantees, revolving lines of credit, and other sophisticated financial techniques, such as factoring and mortgage financing. Increase SBA's Community Development program so that growth-minded communities can help themselves by building industrial parks and shopping centers. Continue the rejuvenation of the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program, leading to greater availability of venture capital for new business enterprises. See that a fair share of all Federal dollars spent on goods and services goes to small business. Create established secondary financial markets for SBA loans, affording ready liquidity for financial institutions and opening up more financial resources to small firms. Through tax incentives, encourage the start-up of more new businesses, and work for a tax system that more fairly applies to small business. Establish special programs that will permit small firms to comply with consumer, environmental, and other new government regulations without undue financial burden. Improving the Quality of Life HEALTH CARE Our goal is to enable every American to secure quality health care at reasonable cost. We pledge a balanced approach - one that takes into account the problems of providing sufficient medical personnel and facilities. Last year President Nixon proposed one of the most all-inclusive health programs in our history. But the Opposition Congress has dragged its feet and most of this program has yet to be enacted into law. To increase the supply of medical services, we will continues to support programs to help our schools graduate more physicians, dentists, nurses and allied health personnel, with special emphasis on family practitioners and others who deliver primary medical care. We will also encourage the use of such allied personnel as doctors' assistants, foster new area health education centers, channel more services into geographic areas which now are medically deprived, and improve the availability of emergency medical care. We note with pride that the President has already signed the most comprehensive health manpower legislation ever enacted. To improve efficiency in providing health and medical, care, we have developed and will continue to encourage a pluralistic approach to the delivery of quality health care including innovative experiments such as health maintenance organizations. We also support efforts to develop ambulatory medical care services to reduce hospitalization and keep costs down. To reduce the cost of health care, we stress our efforts to curb inflation in the economy; we will also expand the supply of medical services and encourage greater cost consciousness in hospitalization and medical care. In doing this we realize the importance of the doctor-patient relationship and the necessity of insuring that individuals have freedom of choice of health providers. To assure access to basic medical care for all our people, we support a program financed by employers, employees and the Federal Government to provide comprehensive health insurance coverage, including insurance against the cost of long-term and catastrophic illnesses and accidents and renal failure which necessitates dialysis, at a cost which all Americans can afford. The National Health Insurance Partnership plan and the Family Health Insurance Plan proposed by the President meet these specifications. They would build on existing private health insurance systems, not destroy them. We oppose nationalized compulsory health insurance. This approach would at least triple in taxes the amount the average citizen now pays for health and would deny families the right to choose the kind of care they prefer. Ultimately it would lower the overall quality of health care for all Americans. We believe that the most effective way of improving health in the long run is by emphasis on preventive measures. The serious physical fitness problem in our country requires urgent attention. The President recently reorganized the Council on Physical Fitness and Sports to increase the leadership of representatives of medicine, physical education, sports associations and school administrations. The Republican Party urges intensification of these efforts, particularly in the Nation's school systems, to encourage widespread participation in effective physical fitness programs. We have initiated this Nation's first all-out assault against cancer. Led by the new National Cancer Institute, the drive to eliminate this cruel killer will involve Federal spending of nearly $430 million in fiscal year 1973, almost twice the funding of just two years ago. We have also launched a major new attack on sickle cell anemia, a serious blood disorder afflicting many black Americans, and developed a comprehensive program to deal with the menace of lead-based paint poisoning, including the screening of approximately 1,500,000 Americans. We support expanded medical research to find cures for the major diseases of the heart, blood vessels, lungs and kidneys - diseases which now account for over half the deaths in the United States. We have significantly advanced efforts to combat mental retardation and established a national goal to cut its incidence in half by the year 2000. We continue to support the concept of comprehensive community mental health centers. In this fiscal year $135 million - almost three times the 1970 level - will be devoted to the staffing of 422 community mental health centers serving a population of 56 million people. We have intensified research on methods of treating mental problems, increasing our outlays from $76 million in 1969 to approximately $96 million for 1973. We continue to urge extension of private health insurance to cover mental illness. We have also improved consumer protection, health education and accident prevention programs. And in Moscow this year, President Nixon reached an agreement with the Soviet Union on health research which may yield substantial benefits in many fields in the years ahead. EDUCATION We take pride in our leadership these last four years in lifting both quality and equality in American education - from preschool to graduate school - working toward higher standards than ever before. Our two most pressing needs in the 1970's are the provision of quality education for all children, and equitable financing of steadily rising costs. We pledge our best efforts to deal effectively with both. Months ago President Nixon sent Congress a two-part comprehensive proposal on school busing. The first is the Student Transportation Moratorium Act of 1972 - legislation to halt immediately all further court-ordered busing and give Congress time to devise permanent new arrangements for assuring desegregated, quality education. The details of such arrangements are spelled out in a companion bill, the Equal Educational Opportunities Act. This measure would:  Provide $2.5 billion in Federal aid funds to help promote quality education while preserving neighborhood schools; Accord equal educational opportunities to all children; Include an educational bill of rights for Spanish-speaking people, American Indians, and others who face special language problems in schools; Offer, for the first time, a real chance for good schooling for the hundreds of thousands of children who live in urban centers; Assure that the people's elected representatives in Congress play their proper role in developing specific methods for protecting the rights guaranteed by the 14th amendment, rather than leaving this task to judges appointed for life. We are committed to guaranteeing equality of educational opportunity and to completing the process of ending de jure school segregation. At the same time, we are irrevocably opposed to busing for racial balance. Such busing fails its stated objective - improved learning opportunities - while it achieves results no one wants - division within communities and hostility between classes and races. We regard it as unnecessary, counter-productive and wrong. We favor better education for all children, not more transportation for some children. We favor the neighborhood school concept. We favor the decisive actions the President has proposed to support these ends. If it is necessary to accomplish these purposes, we would favor consideration of an appropriate amendment to the Constitution. In the field of school finance, we favor a coordinated effort among all levels of government to break the pattern of excessive reliance on local property taxes to pay educational costs. Our nation's intellectual resources are remarkable for their strength and public availability. American intellectuals have at least two important historical roles of which we are deeply conscious. One is to inform the public, the other to assist government by thoughtful criticism and consultation. We affirm our confidence in these functions and especially in the free play of ideas and discourse which they imply. We cherish the nation's universities as centers of learning, as conservers of our culture, and as analysts of our society and its institutions. We will continue to strive to assure their economic well-being. The financial aid we have given and will continue to give in the form of funds for scholarships, research, building programs and new teaching methods must never be used as a device for imposing political controls on our schools. We believe that universities should be centers of excellence - that they should recruit faculty on the basis of ability to teach and admit students on the basis of ability to learn. Yet, excellence can be too narrowly confined - abilities overlooked, and social conformity mistaken for educational preparation. We pledge continued support of collegiate and university efforts to insure that no group in our society - racial, economic, sexual or regional - is denied access to the opportunities of higher education. Our efforts to remedy ancient neglect of disadvantaged groups will continue in universities as well as in society at large, but we distinguish between such efforts and quotas. We believe the imposition of arbitrary quotas in the hiring of faculties or the enrollment of students has no place in our universities; we believe quotas strike at the essence of the university. We recognize that the public should have access to the most rational and most effective kinds of education. Vocational training should be available to both young and old. We emphasize the importance of continuing education, of trades and technologies, and of all the honorable vocations which provide the society with its basic necessities. Such training must complement our more traditional forms of education; it will relieve the pressures on our universities and help us adapt to the rapid pace of technological change. Perhaps more important, it will help to restore a public sense of importance to these essential jobs and trades. Moreover, we believe our educational system should not instruct in a vacuum, unmindful that the students ultimately will engage in a career. Our institutions of learning, from earliest years to graduate schools can perform a vital function by coupling an awareness of the worth of work to the delivery of fundamental education. We believe this kind of career education blended into our school curricula, can help to prevent the aimlessness and frustration now experienced by large numbers of young people who leave the education system unable to cope with today's complex society. In recognizing the fundamental necessity for quality education of all children, including the exceptional child, we recommend research and assistance in programs directed to the problems of dyslectic and hyperkinetic children who represent an estimated ten percent of the school population. By every measure, our record in the field of education is exceptionally strong. The United States Office of Education is operating this year under its highest budget ever - some $5.1 billion. Federal aid to elementary and secondary education has increased 60 percent over the past four years. Federal aid for college students has more than tripled. We are proud of these accomplishments. We pledge to carry them forward in a manner consistent with our conviction that the Federal Government should assist but never control the educational process. But we also believe that the output of results, not the input of dollars, is the best yardstick of effectiveness in education. When this Administration took office in 1969, it found American schools deficient at many points. Our reform initiatives have included:  An Office of Child Development to coordinate all Federal programs targeted on the first five years of life and to make the Head Start program work better; A Right to Read Program, aimed at massive gains in reading ability among Americans of all ages; A Career Education curriculum which will help to prepare students for the world of work; A National Institute of Education to be a center for research on the learning process; and A proposed National Foundation for Higher Education. We have also proposed grant and loan programs to support a national commitment that no qualified student should be barred from college by lack of money. The Education Amendment of 1972 embodied substantial portions of that proposal and marked the nation's most far-reaching commitment to make higher education available to all. Our non-public schools, both church-oriented and nonsectarian, have been our special concern. The President has emphasized the indispensable role these schools play in our educational system - from the standpoints of the large numbers of pupils they serve, the competition and diversity they help to maintain in American education, and the values they help to teach - and he has stated his determination to help halt the accelerating trend of non-public school closures. We believe that means which are consistent with the Constitution can be devised for channeling public financial aid to support the education of all children in schools of their parents' choice, non-public as well as public. One way to provide such aid appears to be through the granting of income tax credits. For the future, we also pledge Special Revenue Sharing for Education, continued work to develop and implement the Career Education concept, and continued efforts to establish a student financial aid system to bring higher education within the reach of any qualified person. WELFARE REFORM The Nation's welfare system is a mess. It simply must be reformed. This system, essentially unchanged since the 1930's, has turned into a human and fiscal nightmare. It penalizes the poor. It provides discriminatory benefits. It kills any incentives its victims might have to work their way out of the morass. Among its victims are the taxpayers. Since 1961 the Federal cost of welfare has skyrocketed over 10 times - from slightly over $1 billion then to more than $11 billion now. State and local costs add to this gigantic expenditure. And here are the things are paying for:  The present system drains work incentive from the employed poor, as they see welfare families making as much or more on the dole. Its discriminatory benefits continue to ensnare the needy, aged, blind and disabled in a web of inefficient rules and economic contradictions. It continues to break up poor families, since a father's presence makes his family ineligible for benefits in many states. Its dehumanizing lifestyle thus threatens to envelop yet another ""welfare generation ."" Its injustices and costs threaten to alienate taxpayer super port for welfare programs of any kind. Perhaps nowhere else is there a greater contrast in policy and philosophy than between the Administration's remedy for the welfare ills and the financial orgy proposed by our political opposition. President Nixon proposed to change our welfare system ""to provide each person with a means of escape from welfare into dignity."" His goals were these:  A decent level of payment to genuinely needy welfare recipients regardless of where they live. Incentives not to loaf, but to work. Requiring all adults who apply for welfare to register for work and job training and to accept work or training. The only exceptions would be the aged, blind and disabled and mothers of preschool children. Expanding job training and child care facilities so that recipients can accept employment. Temporary supplements to the incomes of the working poor to enable them to support their families while continuing to work. Uniform Federal payment standards for all welfare recipients. In companion actions, our efforts to improve the nutrition of poor people resulted in basic reforms in the food stamp program. The number of recipients increased from some three million to 13 million, and now 8.4 million needy children participate in the school lunch program, almost three times the number that participated in 1968. Now, nearly 10,000 nutrition aides work in low-income communities. In 1968 there were none. Since 1969, we have increased the Federal support for family planning threefold. We will continue to support expanded family planning programs and will foster research in this area so that more parents will be better able to plan the number and spacing of their children should they wish to do so. Under no circumstances will we allow any of these programs to become compulsory or infringe upon the religious conviction or personal freedom of any individual. We all feel compassion for those who through no fault of their own cannot adequately care for themselves. We all want to help these men, women and children achieve a decent standard of living and become self-supporting. We continue to insist, however, that there are too many people on this country's welfare rolls who should not be there. With effective cooperation from the Congress, we pledge to stop these abuses. We flatly oppose programs or policies which embrace the principle of a government-guaranteed income. We reject as unconscionable the idea that all citizens have the right to be supported by the government, regardless of their ability or desire to support themselves and their families. We pledge to continue to push strongly for sound welfare reform until meaningful and helpful change is enacted into law by the Congress. LAW ENFORCEMENT We have solid evidence that our unrelenting war on crime is being won. The American people know that once again the thrust of justice in our society will be to protect the law-abiding citizenry against the criminal, rather than absolving the criminal of the consequences of his own desperate acts. Serious crimes rose only one percent during the first quarter of this year - down from six percent last year and 13 percent the year before. From 1960 to 1968 major crime went up 122 percent. The tact is, in the first quarter of 1972, 80 of our 155 largest cities had an actual decline in reported crime. In our Nation's Capitol, our anti-crime programs have been fully implemented. Through such measures as increased police, street lighting, a Narcotics Treatment Administration, court reform and special prosecuting units for major offenders we have steadily dropped the crime rate since November 1969. By the first quarter of this year, the serious crime rate was down to half its all-time high. When our Administration took office, a mood of lawlessness was spreading rapidly, undermining the legal and moral foundations of our society. We moved at once to stop violence in America. We have:  Greatly increased Federal aid to State and local law enforcement agencies across the country, with more than $1.5 billion spent on 50,000 crime-fighting projects. Augmented Justice Department funding four-fold and provided more marshals, more judges, more narcotics agents, more Assistant United States Attorneys in the field. Raised the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration budget ten-fold, earmarking $575 million of the $850 million for 1973 to upgrade State and local police and courts through revenue sharing. Added 600 new Special Agents to the FBI. Raised Federal spending on juvenile delinquency from $15 million to more than $180 million and proposed legislation to launch a series of model youth services. Appointed Attorneys General with a keen sense of the rights of both defendants and victims, and determination to enforce the laws. Appointed judges whose respect for the rights of the accused is balanced by an appreciation of the legitimate needs of law enforcement. Added to the Supreme Court distinguished lawyers of firm judicial temperament and fidelity to the Constitution. Even more fundamentally, we have established a renewed climate of respect for law and law enforcement. Now those responsible for enforcing the law know they have the full backing of their Government We recognize that programs involving work release, study release and halt-way houses have contributed substantially to the rehabilitation of offenders and we support these programs. We further support training programs for the staffs in our correctional institutions and will continue to see that minority group staff members are recruited to work in these institutions. The Fight Against Organized Crime. To most of us, organized criminal activity seems remote and unreal - yet syndicates supply the narcotics pushed on our youth, corrupt local officials, terrify legitimate businesses and fence goods stolen from Our homes. This Administration strongly supported the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, and under our Strike Force concept we have combined Federal enforcement agencies to wage a concerted assault on organized crime. We have expanded the number of these strike forces and set a high priority for a new campaign against the syndicates. Last year we obtained indictments against more than 2,600 members or associates of organized crime syndicates - more than triple the number indicted in 1968. At last we have the lawless elements in our society on the run. The Republican Party intends to keep them running. Rehabilitation of Offenders. We have given the rehabilitation of criminal offenders more constructive, top-level attention than it has received at any time in our Nation's history. In November 1969, the President ordered a ten-year improvement program in prison facilities, correctional systems and rehabilitation methods and procedures. We believe the correctional system not only should punish, but also should educate and rehabilitate. We are determined to press ahead with reform of the system to make it more effective against crime. Almost a decade of inadequate Federal support of law enforcement has left deep scars in our society, but now a new mood pervades the country. Civil disorders and campus violence are no longer considered inevitable. Today, we see a new respect for law and order. Our goal is justice - for everyone. We pledge a tireless campaign against crime - to restore safety to our streets, and security to law-abiding citizens who have a right to enjoy their homes and communities free from fear. We pledge to:  Continue our vigorous support of local police and law enforcement agencies, as well as Federal law enforcement agencies. Seek comprehensive procedural and substantive reform of the Federal Criminal Code. Accelerate the drive against organized crime. Increase the funding of the Federal judiciary to help clear away the logjam in the courts which obstructs the administration of justice. Push forward in prison reform and the rehabilitation of offenders. Intensify efforts to prevent criminal access to all weapons, including special emphasis on cheap, readily-obtainable handguns, retaining primary responsibility at the State level, with such Federal law as necessary to enable the States to meet their responsibilities. Safeguard the right of responsible citizens to collect, own and use firearms for legitimate purposes, including hunting, target shooting and self-defense. We will strongly support efforts of all law enforcement agencies to apprehend and prosecute to the limit of the law all those who use firearms in the commission of crimes. Drug Abuse. The permissiveness of the 1960's left no legacy more insidious than drug abuse. In that decade narcotics became widely available, most tragically among our young people. The use of drugs became endowed with a sheen of false glamour identified with social protest. By the time our Nation awakened to this cancerous social ill, it found no major combat weapons available. Soon after we took office, our research disclosed there were perhaps hundreds of thousands of heroin users in the United States. Their cravings multiplied violence and crime. We found many more were abusing other drugs, such as amphetamines and barbiturates. Marijuana had become commonplace. All this was spurred by criminals using modern methods of mass distribution against outnumbered authorities lacking adequate countermeasures. We quickly launched a massive assault against drug abuse. We intercepted the supply of dangerous drugs at points of entry and impeded their internal distribution. The budget for international narcotics control was raised from $5 million to over $50 million. Narcotics control coordinators were appointed in 59 United States embassies overseas to work directly with foreign governments in stopping drug traffic. We have narcotics action agreements with over 20 countries. Turkey has announced a total ban on opium production and, with our cooperation, France has seized major heroin laboratories and drugs. To inhibit the distribution of heroin in our own country, we increased the law enforcement budget for drug control more than 10 times - from $20 million to $244 million. We are disrupting major narcotics distribution in wholesale networks through the combined efforts of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, Customs operations at our borders, and a specially created unit of over 400 Internal Revenue agents who conduct systematic tax investigations of targeted middle and upper echelon traffickers, smugglers, and financiers. Last January, we established the Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement to disrupt street and mid-level heroin traffickers. We established the ""Heroin Hot Line"" - a nationwide toll free phone number (800/368-5363) - to give the public a single number for reporting information on heroin pushers. Last year we added 2,000 more Federal narcotics agents, and the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs has trained over 170,000 State and local personnel. And we are getting results. This past year four times as much heroin was seized as in the year this Administration took office. Since 1969, the number of drug-related arrests has nearly doubled. For drug abuse prevention and treatment we increased the budget from $46 million to over $485 million. The demand for illicit drugs is being reduced through a massive effort directed by a newly created office in the White House. Federally funded drug treatment and rehabilitation programs were more than doubled last fiscal year, and Federal programs now have the capacity to treat more than 60,000 drug abusers a year. To alert the public, particularly the youth, to the dangers of drugs, we established a National Clearinghouse for Drug Abuse Information in 1970 as well as a $3.5 million Drug Education and Training Program. We realize that the problem of drug abuse cannot be quickly solved, but we have launched a massive effort where practically none existed before. Nor will we relax this campaign:  We pledge to seek further international agreements to restrict the production and movement of dangerous drugs. We pledge to expand our programs of education, rehabilitation, training, and treatment. We will do more than ever before to conduct research into the complex psychological regions of disappointment and alienation which have led many young people to turn desperately toward drugs. We firmly oppose efforts to make drugs easily available. We equally oppose the legalization of marijuana. We intend to solve problems, not create bigger ones by legalizing drugs of unknown physical impact. We pledge the most intensive law enforcement war ever waged. We are determined to drive the pushers of dangerous drugs from the streets, schools, and neighborhoods of America. AGRICULTURE AND RURAL LIFE Our agriculture has become the economic marvel of the world. Our American farmers and ranchers have tripled per worker production in the last 20 years, while non-farm industries have increased theirs a little over half. Yet when we took office three and a half years ago, the farm community was being shockingly shortchanged for its remarkable achievements. Inflation was driving up both the cost of farming and the cost of living - indeed, driving up all prices except the prices of products the farmers were taking to market. Overall farm income was down. Farm exports were low. Bureaucratic planting regulations were oppressive. All across the country family farms were failing. Our moves to deal with these problems have been numerous and effective. The rate of inflation has been curbed without forcing down prices for commodities, even as we have stepped up our drive against rising food costs in the cities. Net farm income has soared to a record high of more than 818 billion. During these Republican years average net farm income has been over $2 billion a year higher than during the last two Administrations. For the same period average income per farm is up more than 40 percent. And farm exports now stand at a record $8 billion, sharply up from the $5.7 billion when we took office. Operating loans to help young farmers have reached the highest levels in history. Administration-backed legislation has given farmers much greater freedom to plant what they choose and we have given assistance to cooperatives to strengthen the farmers' bargaining positions. Rural development has been energetically carried forward, and small towns and rural areas have been helped to adjust and grow. The loan programs of the Farmers Home Administration for farm and rural people have been dramatically increased. Electric and telephone service in rural areas has beep substantially expanded, a Rural Telephone Bank has beer enacted, and the Farm Credit Administration has been streamlined. The total national investment in rural development has almost tripled. Heading the Department of Agriculture have been leaders who understand and forcefully speak out for the farming people of America. Farmers are benefitting markedly from our successful relief efforts to expand exports - notably a $750 million sale of United States grains to the Soviet Union, with prospects of much more. Last year we negotiated a similar sale amounting to $135 million. For the future, we pledge to intensify our efforts to:  Achieve a $10 billion annual export market by opening new foreign markets, while continuing to fight for fair treatment for American farm products in our traditional markets. Follow sound economic policies to break inflation and reduce interest rates;  Expand activities to assist farmers in bargaining for fair prices and reasonable terms in a rapidly changing marketing system; Keep farm prices in the private sector, not subject to price controls; Support family farms as the preferred method of organizing agricultural production, and protect them from the unfair come petition of farming by tax-loss corporations and non-farm enterprises; Reform Federal estate tax laws, which often force the precipitate sale of family farms to help pay the tax, in such ways as to help support the continuance of family farms as institutions of great importance to the American way of life; Provide greater credit, technical assistance, soil and water conservation aid, environmental enhancement, economic stimulus, and sympathetic leadership to America's rural areas and communities; Concentrate research on new uses of agricultural products; Continue assistance to farm cooperatives, in their efforts to improve their services to their members; Develop land and water policy that takes account of the many uses to which these resources may be put; Establish realistic environmental standards which safeguard wise resource use, while avoiding undue burdens on farmers; Use forums of national leaders to create a better understanding by all citizens, those in the cities and suburbs as well as those in small towns, of the difficult problems confronting farm and ranch families in a modern agriculture. We will not relax our efforts to increase net farm income, to narrow the spread between farm and non-farm income levels, and to pursue commodity programs that will enable farmers and ranchers to receive fair prices for what they produce. : COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT For more than a quarter century the Federal Government has sought to assist in the conservation and rebuilding of our urban centers. Yet, after the spending of billions of dollars and the commitment of billions more to future years, we now know that many existing programs are unsuited to the complex problems of the 1970's. Programs cast in the mold of the big government philosophy of the 1930's are simply incapable of meeting the challenges of today. Our Party stands, therefore, for major reform of Federal Community development programs and the development of a new philosophy to cope with urban ills. Republican urban strategy rejects throwing good money after bad money. Instead, through fundamental fiscal, management and program reforms, we have created a new Federal partnership through which State, county and municipal governments can best cope with specific problems such as education, crime, drug abuse, transportation, pollution and housing. We believe the urban problems of today fall into these categories:  The fiscal crises of State, county, and municipal governments. The need for a better quality and greater availability of urban services. The continual requirement of physical development. The need for better locally designed. locally implemented, locally controlled solutions to the problems of individual urban areas. In the last category - the importance of grass roots planning and participation - our Republican Party has made its most important contribution to solving urban problems. We hold that government planners should be guided by the people through their locally elected representatives. We believe that real solutions require the full participation of the private sector. To help ease the fiscal crises of State, county and municipal governments, we pledge increased Federal assistance - assistance we have more than doubled in the past four years. And, as stressed elsewhere in this Platform, we remain committed to General Revenue Sharing, which could reduce the oppressive property tax. Our proposals for Special Revenue Sharing for Urban Development, transportation, manpower and law enforcement - all still bottled up by the opposition Congress - are designed to make our towns and cities places where Americans can once again the and work without physical or environmental hazard. Urban areas are already benefiting from major funding increases which we fought for in the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration programs and in our $10-billion mass transit program. Urban areas are also benefiting from our new Legacy of Parks program, which is bringing recreational opportunities closer to where people live. We are committed also to the physical development of urban areas. We have quadrupled subsidized housing starts for low and moderate income families since 1969, and effected substantial increases for construction of municipal waste treatment facilities We strongly oppose the use of housing or community development programs to impose arbitrary housing patterns on unwilling communities. Neither do we favor dispersing large numbers of people away from their homes and neighborhoods against their will. We do believe in providing communities, with their full consent, guidance and cooperation, with the means and incentives to increase the quantity and quality of housing in conjunction with providing increased access to jobs for their low income citizens. We also pledge to carry forward our policy of encouraging the development of new towns in order to afford all Americans a wider range of residential choices. Additionally, our Special Revenue Sharing for Urban and Rural Community Development, together with General Revenue Sharing and nation-wide welfare reform, are basic building blocks for a balanced policy of national growth, leading to better lives for all Americans, whether they dwell in cities, suburbs or rural areas. Our Party recognizes counties as viable units of regional government with a major role in modernizing and restructuring local services, eliminating duplication and increasing local cooperation. We urge Federal and State governments, in implementing national goals and programs, to utilize the valuable resources of counties as area-wide, general-purpose governments. HOUSING Our Republican Administration has made more and better housing available to more of our citizens than every before. We are building two-and-a-third million new homes a year - 65 percent more than the average in the eight years of the two previous Administrations. Progress has not been in numbers alone; housing quality has also risen to an all-time high - far above that of any other country. We will maintain and increase this pattern of growth. We are determined to attain the goal of a decent home for every American. Significant number of Americans still lack the means for decent housing, and in such cases - where special need exists - we will continue to apply public resources to help people acquire better apartments and homes. We further pledge:  Continued housing production for low and moderate income families, which has sharply increased since President Nixon took office. Improvement of housing subsidy programs and expansion of mortgage credit activities of Federal housing agencies as necessary to keep Americans the best-housed people in the world. Continued development of technological and management innovations to lower housing costs - a program begun by Operation Breakthrough, which is assisting in the development of new methods for more economical production of low-cost, high-quality homes. We urge prompt action by State, county and municipal governments to seek solutions to the serious problems caused by abandoned buildings in urban areas. TRANSPORTATION When President Nixon took office a crisis in transportation was imminent, as indicated by declining mass transportation service, mounting highway deaths, congested urban streets, long delays at airports and airport terminals, deterioration of passenger train service, and a dwindling Merchant Marine. Within two years the President had proposed and signed into law:  A $10-billion, 12-year program - the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1970 - to infuse new life into mass transportation systems and help relieve urban congestion; A major 10-year program involving $280-million annually for airport development projects as well as an additional $250 million annually to expand airways systems and facilities; The Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 to streamline and improve the nation's passenger train service; New research and development projects, including automatic people movers, improved Metroliner and Turbo-trains, quieter aircraft jet engines, air pollution reduction for mass transportation vehicles, and experimental safety automobiles. We strongly support these research and development initiatives of the Department of Transportation. Four years ago we called attention to the decline of our Merchant Marine due to previous neglect and apathy. We promised a vigorous ship replacement program to meet the changing pattern of our foreign commerce. We also pledged to expand maritime research and development and the simplification and revision of construction and operating subsidy procedures. By the enactment of the Merchant Marine Act of 1970, we have reversed the long decline of our Merchant Marine. We reaffirm our goals set forth in 1968 and anticipate the future development of a merchant fleet that will give us defensive mobility in time of emergency as well as economic strength in time of peace. To reduce traffic and highway deaths, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been reorganized and expanded, with dramatic results. In 1971, the number of traffic deaths per hundred million miles driven was the lowest in history. To help restore decision-making to the people, we have proposed a new Single Urban Fund providing almost $2-billion a year by 1975 to State and metropolitan areas to assist local authorities in solving their own transportation problems in their own way. Our proposal for Special Revenue Sharing for Transportation would also help governments close to the people meet local needs and provide greater freedom to achieve a proper balance among the Nation's major transportation modes. To revitalize the surface freight transportation industry, we have recommended measures to modernize railway equipment and operations and to update regulatory practices. These measures, on which Congress still dawdles, would help curb inflation by saving the public billions of dollars a year in freight costs. Their enactment would also expand employment and improve our balance of trade. The Nation's transportation needs are expected to double in the next 20 years. Our Party will continue to pursue policies and programs that will meet these needs and keep the country well ahead of rapidly changing transportation demands. ENVIRONMENT In January 1969, we found the Federal Government woefully unprepared to deal with the rapidly advancing environmental crisis. Our response was swift and substantial. First, new decision-making organizations were set in place - the first Council on Environmental Quality, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. We also proposed a new Department of Natural Resources, but Congress has failed to act. We also created a National Industrial Pollution Control Council to enlist the private sector more actively against environmental decay, and a Presidential Federal Property Review Board was appointed to ferret out Federal property for transfer to local park recreational uses. Second, we gave top priority in the Federal Budget to environmental improvements. This fiscal year approximately $2.4-billion will be expended for major environmental programs, three times more than was being spent when President Nixon took office. Third, sweeping environment messages were sent to Congress in 1970, 1971 and 1972 covering air quality, water quality, toxic waste substances, ocean dumping, noise, solid waste management, land use, parklands and many other environmental concerns. Almost all of these proposals still languish in the opposition Congress. Although the President cannot move until and unless Congress passes laws in many of these areas, he nevertheless can act - and has acted - forcefully on many fronts: He has directed the Federal Government to practice ecological leadership by using low-lead gasoline and recycled paper. He has cracked down on flagrant polluters, greatly increasing prosecutions and making the first use of Federal authority to shut down major industries during an air pollution crisis. The fragile and unique Everglades were saved from a jetport. Pesticide abuses were curtailed. Strict new clean air standards were set, and in many urban centers the air is improving. Regulations were issued to make one grade of lead-free and phosphorous-free gasoline available throughout the Nation by July 1, 1974, and a phased reduction was required in the lead content of regular and premium gasolines. Auto makers were required to design air pollution control systems to assure that vehicles comply with Federal emission standards throughout their useful life. Additionally, the President launched the Legacy of Parks program to convert under-utilized Federal properties to park and recreational use, with special emphasis on new parks in or near urban areas. More than 140 areas have already been made available to States, counties and municipalities for such use including priceless stretches of ocean beach. Moreover, nearly two million acres of land have been purchased by Federal State and local governments for recreation and for historical and natural preservation purposes. A system of recreational trails for hiking, bicycling and horseback riding will help meet the pressing recreational needs of our increasingly urbanized society. Many State, county and municipal governments are developing bicycle, hiking, and horseback trails with our active assistance through various Federal programs. We pledge our continued commitment to seeking out practical ways for more and safer bicycling opportunities within our cities and metropolitan areas. We have also provided effective leadership in international environmental activity. The President has negotiated the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement with Canada and a Cooperative Agreement on Environmental Protection with the Soviet Union. The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm adopted our government's initiatives for the creation of an international fund for the environment, a continuing United Nations agency for environmental problems, and the control of ocean dumping. Our President has led the effort for a ten-year moratorium on commercial whaling everywhere in the world. We call upon the Congress to act promptly on the President's environmental proposals still stalled there - more than 20 in all. These include:  Legislation to control, and in some cases prohibit, the dumping of wastes into the oceans, estuaries and the Great Lakes. A federal Noise Control Act to reduce and regulate unwanted sound from aircraft, construction and transportation equipment. Authority to control hundreds of chemical substances newly marketed each year. Legislation to encourage the States to step up to pressing decisions on how best to use land. Both environmentally critical areas such as wetlands and growth-inducing developments such as airports would have particular scrutiny. A proposal to provide for early identification and protection of endangered wildlife species. This would, for the first time, make the taking of endangered species a Federal offense. Establishment of recreational areas near metropolitan centers such as the Gateway National Recreational Area in New York and New Jersey and the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in and around San Francisco Bay. The nostalgic notion of turning the clock back to a simpler time may be appealing but is neither practical nor desirable We are not going to abandon the automobile, but we are going to have a clean-burning engine. We are not going to give up electric lighting and modern industry, but we do expect cleanly-produced electric power to run them. We are not going to be able to do without containers for our foods and minerals, but we can improve them and make them reusable or biodegradable. We pledge a workable balance between a growing economy and environmental protection. We will resolve the conflicts sensibly within that framework. We commit ourselves to comprehensive pollution control laws, vigorous implementation of those laws, and rigorous research into the technological problems of pollution control. The beginnings we have made in these first years of the 1970's are evidence of our determination to follow through. We intend to leave the children of America a legacy of clean air, clean water, vast open spaces and easily accessible parks. Natural Resources and Energy. Wilderness areas forests, fish and wildlife are precious natural resources. We have proposed 36 new wilderness areas, adding another 3.6 million acres to the National Wilderness Preservation System. We have made tough new proposals to protect endangered species of wildlife. Public lands provide us with natural beauty, wilderness, and great recreational opportunities as well as minerals, timber, food and fiber. We pledge to develop and manage these lands in a balanced way, both to protect the irreplaceable environment and to maximize the benefits of their use to our society. We will continue these conservation efforts in the years ahead. We recognize and commend the humane societies and the animal welfare societies in their work to protect animals. Water supplies are not a boundless resource. The Republican Party is committed to developing additional water supplies by desalinization. the discovery of new groundwater stocks recycling and wiser and more efficient use of the waters we have. We will continue the development of flood control, navigation improvement and reclamation projects based on valid cost-benefit estimates, including full consideration of environmental concerns. No modern nation can thrive without meeting its energy needs. and our needs are vast and growing. Last year we proposed a broad range of actions to facilitate research and development for clean energy. provide energy resources on Federal lands, assure a timely supply of nuclear fuels, use energy more efficiently, balance environmental and energy needs. and better organize Federal efforts. The National Minerals Policy Act of 1970 encourages development of domestic resources by private enterprise. A program to tap our vast shale resources has been initiated consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. We need a Department of Natural Resources to continue to develop a national, integrated energy policy and to administer and implement that policy as the United States approaches the 21st Century. Energy sources so vitally important to the welfare of our Nation are becoming increasingly interchangeable. There is nothing inherently incompatible between an adequate energy supply and a healthy environment. Indeed, vast quantities of energy are needed to do the work necessary to clean up our air and streams. Without sufficient supplies of power we will not be able to attain our goals of reducing unemployment and poverty and enhancing the American standard of living. Responsible government must consider both the short-term and the long-run aspects of our energy supplies. Avoidance of brownouts and power disruptions now and in the future call for sound policies supporting incentives that will encourage the exploration for. and development of, our fossil fuels. Such policies will buy us time to develop the sophisticated and complex technologies needed to utilize the exotic energy sources of the future. National security and the importance of a favorable balance of trade and balance of payments dictate that we must rot permit our Nation to become overly dependent on foreign sources of energy. Since more than half our Nation's domestic fossil resources now lie under Federal lands, high priority must be given to the governmental steps necessary to the development of these resources by private industry. A liquid metal fast breeder reactor demonstration plant to be built with the financial support of the Atomic Energy Commission, the electric power industry, and the Tennessee alley Authority. We will accelerate research on harnessing thermo-nuclear energy and continue to provide leadership in the production of energy from the sun and geothermal steam. We recognize the serious problem of assuring adequate electric generating capacity in the Nation, and pledge to meet this need without doing violence to our environment. Oceans. The oceans are a vast, largely untapped reservoir of resources, a source of food, minerals, recreation and pleasure, with great potential for economic development. For their maintenance we must:  Encourage the development of coastal zone management systems by the States, in cooperation with the Federal Government, to preserve the coastal environment while allowing for its prudent social and economic development. Protect the oceans from pollution through the creation of binding domestic and international legal and institutional arrangements. Foster arrangements to develop the untapped mineral resources of the seas in an equitable and environmentally sound manner. Establish domestic and international institutions for the management of the ocean fisheries. Fishing in international waters, a way of life for many Americans, must be maintained without harassment on the high seas or unreasonable restrictions. Protect and conserve marine mammals and other marine species to ensure their abundance and especially to protect species whose survival is endangered Maintain a national capability in ocean science and technology and, through the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, work to codify an international legal framework for the peaceful conduct of ocean activities. SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY Basic and applied scientific research and development are indispensable to our national security, our international competitive position, and virtually every aspect of the domestic economy. We have initiated a new research and development strategy which emphasizes a public-private partnership in searching out new ideas and technologies to create new jobs, new internationally competitive industries, and new solutions for complex domestic problems. In support of this strategy we have increased Federal efforts in civilian research and development by 65 percent - from $3.3-billion to $5.4-billion - and expanded research in drug abuse, law enforcement, health care, home building, motor vehicle safety, energy, and child development as well as many other fields. We will place special emphasis on these areas in which breakthroughs are urgently needed:  Abundant, clean energy sources; Safe, fast and pollution-free transportation; Improved emergency health care; Reduction of loss of life, health and property in natural disasters; Rehabilitation of alcoholics and addicts to dangerous drugs. Additionally, we urge the fair and energetic enforcement of all fire prevention laws and applaud the work of the National Commission on Fire Prevention and Control. We encourage accelerated research on methods of fire prevention and suppression, including studies on flammable fabrics, hazardous materials, fire equipment and training procedures. The space program is yielding impressive dividends in earth-oriented applications of space technology - advances in medicine, industrial techniques and consumer products that would still be unknown had we not developed the technology to reach the moon. We will press ahead with the space shuttle program to replace today's expendable launch vehicles and provide low-cost access to space for a wide variety of missions, including those related to earth resources. We pledge to continue to extend our knowledge of the most distant frontiers in space. We will also extend our exploration of the seabed and the sea. We will seek food for the hungry, power for future technologies, new medicines for the sick, and new treatments of water for arid regions of the world. The quantities of metals and minerals needed to maintain our economic health and living standards are so huge as to require the re-use of all recoverable commodities from solid waste materials. We pledge a vigorous program of research and development in order to seek out more economical methods to recover and recycle such commodities, including the processing of municipal solid wastes. We pledge to extend the communications frontier, and to foster the development of orbiting satellite systems that will make possible wholly new, world-wide educational and entertainment programs. We recognize that the productivity of our Nation's research and development efforts can be enhanced through cooperative international projects. The signing of the Moscow agreements for cooperation in space, environment, health, and science and technology has opened a new era in international relations. A similar agreement between the United States and Polish Governments will permit expansion of programs such as the jointly-funded Copernicus Astronomical Center and the Krakow Children's Hospital. Finally, we pledge expanded efforts to aid unemployed scientists and engineers. We are determined to see that such on-going efforts as the Technology Mobilization and Reemployment Program are effective. THE INDIVIDUAL AND GOVERNMENT Even though many urgently-needed administrative proposals have been long delayed or stopped by the opposition Congress, we have kept our 1968 promise to make government more accountable and more responsive to the citizen. One such proposal is General Revenue Sharing with State and local governments - a means of returning to the people powers which for 40 years have grown increasingly centralized in the remote Washington bureaucracy. Another is consolidation of scores of categorical grant programs into six Special Revenue Sharing programs which would make available some $12-billion annually in broad policy fields for States and localities to apply in their own ways to their own needs. Yet another is our proposal to modernize the Executive Branch of the Federal Government by combining six Cabinet departments and several independent agencies into four new departments. So far, the opposition controlled Congress has blocked or ignored all of these proposals. In addition, we have:  Improved domestic policy formulation and implementation by the new Domestic Council and Office of Management and Budget within the Executive Office of the President; Established stronger liaison between the Federal Government and the States, counties and municipalities by a new Office of Intergovernmental Relations, headed by the Vice President; Overhauled the fragmented and poorly coordinated Federal agencies concerned with drug abuse and the environment; Utilized voluntary citizen effort through the formation of the ACTION agency in government and the National Center for Voluntary Action outside of government Proposed reorganization of the Federal regulatory agencies and appointed distinguished people to those agencies; Assured more open government, ending abuse of classification and providing fuller information to the public. We pledge continuing reform and revitalization of government to assure a better response to individual needs. We express deep concern for the flood victims of Tropical Storm Agnes, the worst natural disaster in terms of property damage in our nation's history. Past laws were totally inadequate to meet this crisis, and we commend the President's leadership in urgently recommending the newly-enacted $1.8-billion flood relief measure, greatly expanding and enlarging the present program. We pledge to reevaluate and enlarge the national flood disaster insurance program so that it will be adequate for future emergencies. We will continue to press for the enactment of General and Special Revenue Sharing and to pursue further initiatives both to decentralize governmental activities and to transfer more such activities to the private sector. We will continue to defend the citizen's right to privacy in our increasingly interdependent society. We oppose computerized national data banks and all other ""Big Brother"" schemes which endanger individual rights. We reaffirm our view that voluntary prayer should be freely permitted in public places - particularly, by school children while attending public schools - provided that such prayers are not prepared or prescribed by the state or any of its political subdivisions and that no person's participation is coerced, thus preserving the traditional separation of church and state. We remain committed to a comprehensive program of human rights, social betterment and political participation for the people of the District of Columbia. We will build on our strong record in this area - a record which includes cutting the District of Columbia crime rate in half, aggressive support for a balanced transportation system in metropolitan Washington, initiation of a Bicentennial program and celebration in the national capital region, and support for the first Congressional Delegate in nearly a century. We support voting representation for the District of Columbia in the United States Congress and will work for a system of self-government for the city which takes fair account of the needs and interests of both the Federal Government and the citizens of the District of Columbia. The Republican Party adheres to the principle of self-determination for Puerto Rico. We will welcome and support statehood for Puerto Rico if that status should be the free choice of its people in a referendum vote. Additionally, we will pursue negotiations with the Congress of Micronesia on the future political status of the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands to meet the mutual interests of both parties. We favor extending the right of electing the territorial Governor to the people of American Samoa, and will take complementary steps to increase local self-government in American Samoa. We vigorously support such action as is necessary to permit American citizens resident in Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to vote for President and Vice President in national elections. We support full voting rights in committees for the Delegates to Congress from Guam and the Virgin Islands. In our territorial policy we seek a maximum degree of local self-sufficiency and self-government, while encouraging greater inclusion in Federal services and programs and greater participation in national decision-making. Volunteerism. In our free system, the people are not only the source of our social problems but also the main source of solutions. Volunteerism, therefore, an indispensable national resource, is basic to our Republican philosophy. We applaud the Administration's efforts to encourage volunteerism by all Americans and commend the millions of volunteers who are working in communities and states across the country on myriad projects. We favor further implementation of voluntary action programs throughout the fifty States to assist public and private agencies in working to assure quality life for all human beings. Arts and Humanities. The United States is experiencing a cultural renaissance of inspiring dimension. Scores of millions of our people are now supporting and participating in the arts and humanities in quest of a richer life of the mind and spirit. Our national culture, no longer the preserve of the elite, is becoming a people's heritage of importance to the whole world. We believe, with the President, that ""the Federal Government has a vital role as catalyst, innovator, and supporter of public and private efforts for cultural development."" We have supported a three-year extension of the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, and increased the funding of its two endowments by more than four times the level of three years ago. The State Arts Councils, which operate in all 50 States and the five special jurisdictions have also been strengthened. The Arts Endowment has raised its support for the Nation's museums, orchestras, theatre, dance, opera companies and film centers and encouraged the creativity of individual artists and writers. In addition, the new Federal Expansion Arts Program has been sharply increased. We have encouraged Federal agencies to use the arts in their programs sponsored an annual Design Assembly for Federal administrators, requested the National Endowment for the Arts to recommend a program far upgrading the design of Federal buildings and moved to set new standards of excellence in all design endeavors of the Federal Government. Moreover, the National Endowment for the Humanities, now greatly enlarged, is fostering improved teaching and scholarship in history, literature, philosophy and ethics. The Endowment also supports programs to raise levels of scholarship and teaching in Afro-American, American Indian and Mexican-American studies, has broadened its fellowship programs to include junior college teachers, and stresses adult or continuing education, including educational television and film series. We have also expanded the funding of public broadcasting. For the future, we pledge continuance of our vigorous support of the arts and humanities. A Better Future for All CHILDREN We believe, with the President, that the first five years of life are crucial to a child's development, and further, that every child should hare the opportunity to reach his full potential as an individual. We have, therefore, established the Office of Child Development which has taken a comprehensive approach to the development of young children, combining programs dealing with their physical, social and educational needs and development. We have undertaken a wide variety of demonstration programs to assure our children, particularly poor children, a good start in life - for example, the Parent and Child Center program for infant care, Home Start to strengthen the environment of the preschool child, and Health Start to explore new delivery systems of health care for young children. We have redirected Head Start to perform valuable full day child care and early education services, and more than 380,000 preschool children are now in the program. We have doubled funds for early childhood demonstration programs which win develop new tools and new teaching techniques to serve children who suffer from deafness, blindness and other handicaps. So that no child will be denied the opportunity for a productive life because of inability to read effectively, we have established the Right to Read Program. To add impetus to the entire educational effort, our newly-created National Institute of Education ensures that broad research and experimentation will develop the best educational opportunities for all children. Additionally, we have taken steps to help ensure that children receive proper care while their parents are at work. Moreover, as stated elsewhere in this Platform, we have broadened nutritional assistance to poor children by nearly tripling participation in the food stamp program, more than doubling the number of needy children in the school lunch program, operating a summer feeding program for three million young people, increasing the breakfast program fivefold, and doubling Federal support for child nutritional programs. We are improving medical care for poor children through more vigorous treatment procedures under Medicaid and more effectively targeting maternal and child health services to low-income mothers. We will continue to seek out new means to reach and teach children in their crucial early years. YOUTH We believe that what our youth most want and need is not special treatment as a group apart, but just the opposite - the opportunity for full participation by exercising the rights and responsibilities of adults. In 1970 the President approved legislation which gave the vote to more than 11 million 18-to-20 year olds. The 26th Amendment, which places this important new right in the Constitution, has our enthusiastic backing. Our Administration has already made the draft a far less arbitrary factor in young men's lives. Now we near the point where we can end conscription altogether and achieve our goal of an all-volunteer armed force. Our total war on drug abuse has had special benefits for youth, hardest hit by this menace. Last year we held the first White House Conference ever held by and for young people themselves. The Administration gave the Conference's more than 300 recommendations a searching review, and last spring the President returned a detailed response and action report to the conferees. The anarchy which swept major campuses in the late 1960's penalized no one more severely than the young people themselves. The recent calm on campus is, we believe, in part the result of the President's leadership in winding down the war in Vietnam, reducing the draft, and taking a strong stand against lawlessness, but our view is that colleges themselves are responsible for maintaining a campus climate that will preserve academic freedom. We have proposed legislation to ensure that no qualified student is denied a higher education by lack of funds, and have also moved to meet the often-overlooked concerns of the two-thirds of the college-age young not in school. We have developed a new job-oriented, career-education concept, expanded Federal manpower programs, and provided record numbers of summer job opportunities for young men and women. To engage youthful idealism and energies more effectively, we have created the new ACTION volunteer service agency bringing together the Peace Corps, VISTA, and other volunteer programs; and we encouraged the establishment of the independent National Center for Voluntary Action. We stand for lowering the legal age of majority in all jurisdictions to 18; and we will seek to broaden the involvement of young people in every phase of the political process - as voters, party workers and leaders, candidates and elected officials, and participants in government at municipal, State and Federal levels. We will continue to build on these solid achievements in keeping with our conviction that these young people should have the opportunity to participate fully in the affairs of our society. EQUAL RIGHTS FOR WOMEN The Republican Party recognizes the great contributions women have made to our society as homemakers and mothers, as contributors to the community through volunteer work, and as members of the labor force in careers outside the home. We fully endorse the principle of equal rights, equal opportunities, and equal responsibilities for women, and believe that progress in these areas is needed to achieve the full realization of the potentials of American women both in the home and outside the home. We reaffirm the President's pledge earlier this year: ""The Administration will ... continue its strong efforts to open equal opportunities for women, recognizing clearly that women are often denied such opportunities today. While every woman may not want a career outside the home, every woman should have the freedom to choose whatever career she wishes - and an equal chance to pursue it. This Administration has done more than any before it to help women of America achieve equality of opportunity. Because of its efforts, more top-level and middle-management positions in the Federal Government are held by women than ever before. The President has appointed a woman as his special assistant in the White House, specifically charged with the recruitment of women for policy-making jobs in the United States Government. Women have also been named to high positions in the Civil Service Commission and the Department of Labor to ensure equal opportunities for employment and advancement at all levels of the Federal service. In addition we have:  Significantly increased resources devoted to enforcement of the Fair Labor Standards Act, providing equal pay for equal work. Required all firms doing business with the Government to have affirmative action plans for the hiring and promotion of women. Requested Congress to expand the jurisdiction of the Commission on Civil Rights to cover sex discrimination. Recommended and supported passage of Title IX of the Higher Education Act opposing discrimination against women in educational institutions. Supported the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 giving the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission enforcement power in sex discrimination cases. Continued our support of the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution, our Party being the first national party to back this Amendment. Other factors beyond outright employer discrimination - the lack of child care facilities, for example - can limit job opportunities for women. For lower and middle income families, the President supported and signed into law a new tax provision which makes many child care expenses deductible for working parents. Part of the President's recent welfare reform proposal would provide comprehensive day care services so that women on welfare can work. We believe the primary responsibility for a child's care and upbringing lies with the family. However, we recognize that for economic and many other reasons many parents require assistance in the care of their children. To help meet this need, we favor the development of publicly or privately run, voluntary, comprehensive, quality day care services, locally controlled but federally assisted, with the requirement that the recipients of these services will pay their fair share of the costs according to their ability. We oppose ill-considered proposals, incapable of being administered effectively, which would heavily engage the Federal Government in this area. To continue progress for women's rights, we will work toward:  Ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. Appointment of women to highest level positions in the Federal Government, including the Cabinet and the Supreme Court. Equal pay for equal work. Elimination of discrimination against women at all levels in Federal Government. Elimination of discrimination against women in the criminal justice system, in sentencing, rehabilitation and prison facilities. Increased opportunities for the part-time employment of women, and expanded training programs for women who want to re-enter the labor force. Elimination of economic discrimination against women in credit, mortgage, insurance, property, rental and finance contracts. We pledge vigorous enforcement of all Federal statutes and executive orders barring job discrimination on the basis of sex. We are proud of the contributions made by women to better government. We regard the active involvement of women on all levels of the political process, from precinct to national status, as of great importance to our country. The Republican Party welcomes and encourages their maximum participation. OLDER AMERICANS We believe our Nation must develop a new awareness of the attitudes and needs of our older citizens. Elderly Americans are far too often the forgotten Americans, relegated to lives of idleness and isolation by a society bemused with the concerns of other groups. We are distressed by the tendency of many Americans to ignore the heartbreak and hardship resulting from the generation gap which separates so many of our people from those who have reached the age of retirement. We deplore what is tantamount to cruel discrimination - age discrimination in employment, and the discrimination of neglect and indifference perhaps the cruelest of all. We commit ourselves to helping older Americans achieve greater self-reliance and greater opportunities for direct participation in the activities of our society. We believe that the later years should be, not isolated years, not years of dependency, but years of fulfillment and dignity. We believe our older people are not to be regarded as a burden but rather should be valuable participants in our society. We believe their judgment, their experience, and their talents are immensely valuable to our country. Because we so believe, we are seeking and have sought in many ways to help older Americans - for example:  Federal programs of direct benefit to older Americans have increased more than $16 billion these past four years. As part of this, Social Security benefits are more than 50 percent higher than they were four years ago, the largest increase in the history of social security. Social security benefits have become inflation proof by making them rise automatically to match cost of living increases, a protection long advocated by the Republican Party. We have upgraded nursing homes. Expenditures under the Older Americans Act have gone up 800 percent since President Nixon took office, with a strong emphasis on programs enabling older Americans to live dignified, independent lives in their own homes. The valuable counsel of older people has been sought directly through the White House Conference on Aging. The President has appointed high level advisers on the problems of the aging to his personal staff. We have urged upon the opposition Congress - again, typically, to no avail - numerous additional programs of benefit to the elderly. We will continue pressing for these new initiatives to:  Increase the amount of money a person can earn without losing social security benefits. Increase widow, widower, and delayed retirement benefits. Improve the effectiveness of Medicare, including elimination, of the monthly premium required under Part B of Medicare - the equivalent of more than a three percent social security increase. Strengthen private pension plans through tax deductions to encourage their expansion, improved vesting, and protection of the investments in these funds. Reform our tax system so that persons 65 or over will receive increased tax-free income. Encourage volunteer service activities for older Americans such as the Retired Senior Volunteer Program and the Foster Grandparents Program. Give special attention to bringing full government services within the reach of the elderly to rural areas who are often unable to share fully in their deserved benefits because of geographic inaccessibility. Upgrade other Federal activities important to the elder including programs for nutrition, housing and nursing homes, transportation, consumer protection, and elimination of age discrimination in government and private employment. We encourage constructive efforts which will help older citizens to be better informed about existing programs and services designed to meet their needs, and we pledge to cut away excessive Federal red tape to make it easier for older Americans to receive the benefits to which they are entitled. WORKING MEN AND WOMEN The skill, industry and productivity of American workers are the driving force of our free economy. The Nation's labor unions, comprised of millions of working people, have advanced the well-being not only of their members but also of our entire free enterprise system. We of the Republican Party reaffirm our strong endorsement of Organized Labor's key role in our national life. We salute the statesmanship of the labor union movement. Time and time again, at crucial moments, it has voiced its out-spoken support for a firm and effective foreign policy and for keeping the Armed Forces of the United States modern and strong. The American labor movement and the Republican Party have always worked against the spread of totalitarian forms of government. Together we can continue to preserve in America the best system of government ever devised for human happiness and fulfillment. We are for the right of American workers and their families to enjoy and to retain to the greatest possible extent the rewards of their own labor. We regard collective bargaining as the cornerstone of the nation's labor relations policy. The government's role is not to encroach upon this process but rather to aid the differing parties to make collective bargaining more effective both for themselves and for the public. In furtherance of that concept we will continue to develop procedures whereby the imagination, ingenuity and knowledge of labor and management can more effectively seek solutions for such problems as structural adjustment and productivity. In the construction industry, for example, we will build on a new joint effort between government and all parts of the industry to solve such problems as seasonality and varying peaks of demand to ensure a stable growth in the number of skilled craftsmen . We call upon management and labor to devote their best efforts to finding better ways to conduct labor-management relations so the good of all the people can be advanced without strikes or lockouts. We will continue to search for realistic and fair solutions to emergency labor disputes, guided by two basic principles: first, that the health and safety of the people of the United States should always be paramount; and second, that collective bargaining should be kept as free as possible from government interference. For mine health and safety, we have implemented the most comprehensive legislation in the Nation's history, resulting in a major reduction in mine-related accidents. We pledge continued advancement of the health and safety of workers. We will continue to press for improved pension vesting and other statutory protections to assure that Americans will not lose their hard-earned retirement incomes. We pledge further modernization of the Federal Civil Service Systems including emphasis on executive development. We dedicate ourselves to promotion on merit, equal opportunity, and the setting of clear incentives for higher productivity. We give continuing close attention to the evolving labor-management relationship in the Federal service. We pledge realistic programs of education and training so that all Americans able to do so can make their own way, on their own ability, receiving an equal and fair chance to advance themselves. We flatly oppose the notion that the hard-earned tax dollars of American workers should be used to support those who can work but choose not to, and who believe that the world owes them a living free from any responsibility or care. We are proud of our many other solid achievements on behalf of America's working people - for example:  Nearly five million additional workers brought under the coverage of the unemployment insurance system, and eligibility deadlines twice extended. Funding for more than 166,000 jobs under the Emergency Employment Act. Expansion of vocational education and manpower training programs. Use of the long-neglected Trade Expansion Act to help workers who lose their jobs because of imports. We strongly favor vigorous competition by American business in the world market but in ways that do not displace American jobs.  Negotiation of long-needed limitations on imports of manmade fibers, textiles and other products, thus protecting American jobs. We share the desire of all Americans for continued prosperity in peacetime. We will work closely with labor and management toward our mutual goal of assuring a job for every man and woman seeking the dignity of work. ENDING DISCRIMINATION From its beginning, our Party has led the way for equal rights and equal opportunity. This great tradition has been carried forward by the Nixon Administration. Through our efforts de jure segregation is virtually ended. We pledge continuation of these efforts until no American schoolchild suffers educational deprivation because of the color of his skin or the language he speaks and all schoolchildren are receiving high quality education. In pursuit of this goal. we have proposed $2.5-billion of Federal aid to school districts to improve educational opportunities and build facilities for disadvantaged children. Further to assure minority progress, we have provided more support to predominantly black colleges than ever before - twice the amount being spent when President Nixon took office. Additionally, we have strengthened Federal enforcement of equal opportunity laws. Spending for civil rights enforcement has been increased from $75-million to $602-million - concrete evidence of our commitment to equal justice for all. The President also supported and signed into law the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, which makes the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission a much more powerful body. Working closely with leaders of construction unions, we have initiated 50 ""hometown"" plans which call for more than 35,000 additional minority hirings in the building trades during the next four years. We will continue to search out new employment opportunities for minorities in other fields as well. We believe such new jobs can and should be created without displacing those already at work. We will give special consideration to minority Americans who live and make their way in the rural regions of our country - Americans too often bypassed m the advances of the general society. We have made unprecedented progress in strengthening minority participation in American business. We created the Office of Minority Business Enterprise in March, 1969, to coordinate the Federal programs assisting members of minority groups who seek to establish or expand businesses. We have more than tripled Federal loans, guarantees and grants to minority-owned businesses. More minority Americans are now in our nation's economic mainstream than at any other time in our history, and we pledge every effort to expand these gains. Minority businesses now receive 16 percent of the Small Business Administration dollar - more than double the proportion in 1968. Many Minority Enterprise Small Business Investment Companies have been licensed since 1969 to provide venture capital for minority enterprises. More than $200-million is now available through this program, and we have requested additional funding. In late 1970, we initiated a combined Government-private program to increase minority bank deposits. This year our goal of $100-million has been reached four times over. We pledge to carry forward our efforts to place minority citizens in responsible positions - efforts we feel are already well under way. During the last four years the percentage of minority Federal employees has risen to a record high of almost 20 percent and, perhaps more important, the quality of jobs for minority Americans has improved. We have recruited more minority citizens for top managerial posts in Civil Service than ever before. We will see that our progress in this area will continue and grow. In 1970 President Nixon approved strong new amendments to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and we pledge continued vigilance to ensure that the rights affirmed by this act are upheld. The cultural diversity of America's heritage groups have always been a source of strength for our society and our Party. We reaffirm our commitment to the basic American values which have made this nation the land of opportunity for these groups, originating from all sectors of the world, from Asia to Africa to Europe to Latin America. We will continue our Party's open door policy and work to assure all minorities full opportunity for participation in the political process. We pledge vigorous support of the Bilingual Act and the Ethnic Studies Heritage Act. SPANISH-SPEAKING AMERICANS In recognition of the significant contributions to our country by our proud and independent Spanish-speaking citizens, we have developed a comprehensive program to help achieve equal opportunity. During the last four years Spanish-speaking Americans have achieved a greater role in national affairs. More than thirty have been appointed to high federal positions. To provide the same learning opportunities enjoyed by other American children, we have increased bilingual education programs almost sixfold since 1969. We initiated a 16-point employment program to help Spanish-speaking workers, created the National Economic Development Association to promote Spanish-speaking business development and expanded economic development opportunities in Spanish-speaking communities. We will work for the use of bilingual staff in localities where this language capability is desirable for effective health care. INDIANS, ALASKA NATIVES AND HAWAIIANS President Nixon has evolved a totally new Indian policy which we fully support. The opposition Congress, by inaction on most of the President's proposals, has thwarted Indian rights and opportunities. We commend the Department of Interior for its stalwart defense of Indian land and water rights, and we urge the Congress to join in support of that effort. We further request Congress to permit Indian tribal governments to assume control over the programs of the Departments of Interior and Health. Education and Welfare in their homelands, to assure Indians a role in determining how funds can best be used for their children's schools, to expand Indian economic development opportunity, to triple the funds for Indian credit and create a new Assistant Secretary of the Interior and Territorial Affairs. These reforms, all urged by the President, have been ignored by the Congress. We - with the Indian people - are impatiently waiting. Knowing the Indians' love for their land and recognizing the many wrongs committed in years past, the President has restored Blue Lake in New Mexico to the Taos Pueblo and the Mt. Adams area in Washington to the Yakima Nation. We are seeking to protect Indian water rights in Pyramid bringing suit in the Supreme Court. We are fully aware of the severe problems facing the Menominee Indians in seeking to have Federal recognition restored to their tribe and promise a complete and sympathetic examination of their pleas. We have increased the Bureau of Indian Affairs' budget by 214 percent, nearly doubled funds for Indian health, and are arranging with tribal leaders for the allocation of Bureau funds in accordance with priorities set by the tribal governments themselves. We pledge continued attention to the needs of off-reservation Indians and have launched demonstration projects at Indian centers in nine major cities. We are determined that the first Americans will not be the forgotten Americans, and that their rights will be respected. At the President's recommendation, the Congress voted an Alaska Native Claims Settlement which confirms the titles of the Eskimos, Indians and Aleuts to 40 million acres and compensates them with a generous cash settlement. We will also preserve and continue to protect the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act which provides land already set aside for Hawaiians for homes and the opportunity to preserve their culture. Our achievements for human dignity and opportunity are specific and real, not idle promises. They have brought tremendous progress to many thousands of minority citizens and made our society more just for all. We will press on with our fight against social injustice and discrimination, building upon the achievements already made. Knowing that none of us can reap the fullest blessings of liberty until all of us can, we reaffirm our commitment to the upward struggle for universal freedom led by Abraham Lincoln a century ago. Amendment Adopted We will continue the policies of Indian preference in hiring and promotion and apply it to all levels, including management and supervisory positions in those agencies with programs affecting Indian peoples. The standard of Living of Indian Americans is still far below that of any of the peoples of the United States This intolerable level of existence should be alleviated by enactment of new legislation designed to further Indian self-determination without termination and to close this economic gap and raise the Indian standard of life to that of the rest of America. We favor the development of such legislation in the 93rd Congress. CONSUMERS The American consumer has a right to product safety clearly specified qualities and values, honest descriptions and guarantees, fair credit procedures, and due recourse for fraud and deception. We are addressing these concerns forcefully with executive action and legislative and legal initiatives. The issues involved in this accelerating awareness on the part of consumers lie close to the heart of the dynamic American market: Good products at fair prices made it great; the same things will keep it great. Enlightened business management is as interested in consumer protection and consumer education as are consumers themselves. In a market place as competitive and diverse as ours, a company's future depends on the reputation of its products. One safety error can wipe out an established firm overnight. Unavoidably, the remoteness of business management from the retail counter tends to hamper consumers in resolving quality and performance questions. Technical innovations make it harder for the consumer to evaluate new products. Legal Complexities often deny efficient remedies for deception or product failure. To assist consumers and business, President Nixon established the first Office of Consumer Affairs in the White House and made its Director a member of his personal staff and of the Cost of Living Council. We have also proposed a Buyer's Bill of Rights, including:  Federal authority for the regulation of hazardous consumer products; Requirement of full disclosure of the terms of warranties and guarantees in language all can understand. We support the establishment of an independent Consumer Protection Agency to present the consumer's case in proceedings before Federal agencies and also a consumer product safety agency in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. We oppose punitive proposals which are more anti-business than pro-consumer. We pledge vigorous enforcement of all consumer protection laws and to foster more consumer education as a vital necessity in a marketplace ever increasing in variety and complexity. VETERANS We regard our Nation's veterans precisely as our President does: ""Americans have long known that those who defended the great values of our Nation in wartime are of great value to the Nation when the war is over. It is traditional that the American veteran has been helped by his Nation so that he can create his own 'peace story,' a story of prosperity, independence and dignity. ""Veterans benefit programs have therefore become more than a recognition for services performed in the past; they have become an investment in the future of the veteran and of his country."" Under Republican leadership, far more for our veterans is being done than ever before:  G.I. Bill education benefits have been increased more than 35 percent. Vietnam-era veterans have the highest assistance levels in history to help them pursue educational opportunities. Major cost of living adjustments have been made in compensation and pension payments. Medical services are the best in the history of the Veterans Administration and now include a strong new drug treatment and rehabilitation program. Disability benefits have been increased. GI home loan benefits have been expanded and improved. The total Administration commitment is massive - $12.4 billion for this fiscal year. This is the largest Veterans Administration budget in history, and the third largest of all Federal agencies and departments. We are giving the highest priority to the employment problems of Vietnam veterans. In 1971 we initiated a comprehensive Program which recently placed more than one million Vietnam-era veterans in jobs, training and education programs. For the future, we pledge:  Continuation of the Veterans Administration as a strong, independent agency;  Continuation of an independent system of Veterans Administration health care facilities to provide America's veterans with the best medical care available, including appropriate attention to the problems of the ex-serviceman afflicted with drug and alcohol problems; Continuing attention to the needs of the Vietnam-era veteran, with special emphasis on employment opportunities, education and housing; Continuation of our efforts to raise GI Bill education benefits to a level commensurate with post-World War II benefits in adjusted dollars. Continued effort for a better coordinated national policy on cemeteries and burial benefits for veterans. We will not fail our obligation to the Nation's 29 million veterans and will stand ever watchful of their needs and rights. Conclusion The record is clear. More than any President, Richard Nixon has achieved major changes in policy and direction in our government. He has restored faith - faith that our system will indeed reflect the will of the people - faith that there will be a new era of peace and human progress at home and around the world. To be sure, there is unfinished business on the agenda of our ever-restless Nation. We have great concern for those who have not participated more fully in the general prosperity. The twin evils of crime and drug abuse are still to be conquered. Peace in the world is not yet won. But Republican leadership has restored stability and sanity to our land once again. We have vigorously attacked every major problem. Once again our direction is peace; once again our determination is national strength; once again we are prospering; once again, on a host of fronts, we are making progress. Now we look to tomorrow. We pledge ourselves to go forward at an accelerated pace - with a determination and zeal unmatched before. In four years we mark the 200th anniversary of the freest, most productive, most benevolent nation of all human history. In four years we celebrate one of man's highest achievements - two hundred years as a constitutional republic founded on the noble concept that every person is a sovereign being, possessed of dignity and inalienable rights. Almost two centuries ago, the Founding Fathers envisioned a nation of tree people. at peace with themselves and the world - each with equal opportunity to pursue happiness his own way. Much of that dream has come true; much is still to be fulfilled. We, the Republican Party, pledge ourselves to go forward, hand-in-hand with every citizen, to solve those problems that yet stand in the way of realizing that more perfect union, the dream of the Founding Fathers - a dream enhanced by the free and generous gift of people working together, not in shifting alliances of separated minorities, but in unison of spirit and purpose. We cannot favor, nor can we respect, the notion of group isolation in our United States of America. We must not divide and weaken ourselves by attitudes or policies which would segregate our citizens into separate racial, ethnic, economic, religious or social groups. It is the striving of all of us - our striving together as Americans - that will move our nation continually onward to our Founders' dream. Building on the foundations of peace in the world, and reason and prosperity at home, our Republican Party pledges a new era of progress for man - progress toward more freedom, toward greater protection of individual rights, toward more security from want and fear, toward greater fulfillment and happiness for all. We pledge to the American people that the 200th anniversary of this Nation 1976 will be more than a celebration of two centuries of unequaled success; we pledge it also to be the beginning of the third and greatest century for all of our countrymen and, we pray, for all people in the world.",156434,24497,"preamble this year our republican party has greater reason than ever before for pride in its stewardship. when our accomplishments are weighed - when our opponents' philosophy, programs and candidates are assessed - we believe the american people will rally eagerly to the leadership which since january has brought them a better life in a better land in a safer world. this political contest of is a singular one. no americans before have had a clearer option. the choice is between going forward from dramatic achievements to predictable new achievements, or turning back toward a nightmarish time in which the torch of free america was virtually snuffed out in a storm of violence and protest. it is so easy to forget how frightful it was. there was vietnam - so bloody, so costly, so bitterly divisive - a war in which more than a half-million of america's sons had been committed to battle - a war, it seemed, neither to be won nor lost, but only to he endlessly fought - a war emotionally so tormenting as almost to obliterate america's other worldly concerns . and yet. as our eyes were fixed on the carnage in asia, in europe our alliance had weakened. the western will was dividing and ebbing. the isolation of the people's republic of china, with one-fourth of the world's population, went endlessly on. at home our horrified people watched our cities burn, crime burgeon, campuses dissolve into chaos. a mishmash of social experimentalism, producing such fiscal extravaganzas as the abortive war on poverty, combined with war pressures to drive up taxes and balloon the cost of living. working men and women found their living standards fixed or falling, the victim of inflation. nationwide, welfare skyrocketed out of control . the history of our country may record other crises more costly in material goods, but none so demoralizing to the american people. to millions of americans it seemed we had lost our way. so it was when our republican party came to power. now, four years later, a new leadership with new policies and new programs has restored reason and order and hope. no longer buffeted by internal violence and division, we are on course in calmer seas with a sure, steady hand at the helm. a new spirit, buoyant and confident, is on the rise in our land, nourished by the changes we have made. in the past four years: we have turned toward concord among all americans. we have turned toward reason and order. we have turned toward government responding sensitively and sensibly to the people's hopes and needs. we have turned toward innovative solutions to the nation's most pressing problems. we hare turned toward new paths for social progress - from welfare rolls to payrolls, from wanton pollution to vigorous environmental protection. we have moved far toward peace: withdrawal of our fighting men from vietnam, constructive new relationships with the soviet union and the people's republic of china, the nuclear arms race checked, the mid-east crisis dampened, our alliances revitalized. so once again the foreign policy of the united states is on a realistic footing, promising us a nation secure in a full generation of peace, promising the end of conscription, promising a further allocation of resources to domestic needs. it is a saga of exhilarating progress. we have come far in so short a time. yet, much remains to be done. discontents, frustrations and concerns still stir in the minds and hearts of many of our people, especially the young. as long as america falls short of being truly peaceful, truly prosperous, truly secure, truly just for all, her task is not done. our encouragement is in the fact that things as they are, are far better than things that recently were. our resolve is that things to come can be, and will be, better still. looking to tomorrow, to president nixon's second term and on into the third century of this republic, we of the republican party see a quarter-billion americans peaceful and prospering as never before, humane as never before, their nation strong and just as never before. it is toward this bright tomorrow that we are determined to move, in concert with millions of discerning democrats and concerned independents who will not, and cannot, take part in the convulsive leftward lurch of the national democratic party. the election of requires of the voters a momentous decision - one that will determine the kind of nation this is to be on its 200th birthday four years hence. in this year we must choose between strength and weakness for our country in the years to come. this year we must choose between negotiating and begging with adversary nations. this year we must choose between an expanding economy in which workers will prosper and a hand-out economy in which the idle live at ease. this year we must choose between running our own lives and letting others in a distant bureaucracy run them. this year we must choose between responsible fiscal policy and fiscal folly. this year the choice is between moderate goals historically sought by both major parties and far-out goals of the far left. the contest is not between the two great parties americans have known in previous years. for in this year the national democratic party has been seized by a radical clique which scorns our nation's past and would blight her future. we invite our troubled friends of other political affiliations to join with us in a new coalition for progress. together let us reject the new left prescription for folly and build surely on the solid achievements of president nixon's first term. four years ago we said, in abraham lincoln's words, that americans must think anew and act anew. this we have done, under gifted leadership. the many advances already made, the shining prospects so clearly ahead, are presented in this platform for and beyond. may every american measure our deeds and words thoughtfully and objectively, and may our opponents' claims be equally appraised. once this is done and judgment rendered on election day, we will confidently carry forward the task of doing for america what her people need and want and deserve. toward a full generation of peace foreign policy when richard nixon became president, our country was still clinging to foreign policies fashioned for the era immediately following world war ii. the world had changed dramatically in the 's, but our foreign policies had not. america was hopelessly enmeshed in vietnam. in all parts of the globe our alliances were frayed. with the principal communist powers our relations showed little prospect of improvement. trade and monetary problems were grave. periodic crises had become the way of international economic life. the nation's frustrations had fostered a dangerous spirit of isolationism among our people. america's influence in the world had waned. in only four years we have fashioned foreign policies based on a new spirit of effective negotiation with our adversaries, and a new sense of real partnership with our allies. clearly, the prospects for lasting peace are greater today than at any time since world war ii. new era of diplomacy. not all consequences of our new foreign policy are yet visible precisely because one of its great purposes is to anticipate crises and avoid them rather than merely respond. its full impact will be realized over many years, but already there are vivid manifestations of its success. before this administration, a presidential visit to peking would have been unthinkable. yet our president has gone there to open a candid airing of differences so that they will not lead some day to war. all over the world tensions have eased as, after a generation of hostility, the strongest of nations and the most populous of nations have started discoursing again. during the 's, presidential visits to moscow were twice arranged and twice cancelled. now our president has conferred, in the soviet union, with soviet leaders, and has hammered out agreements to make this world a much safer place. our president's quest for peace has taken him to other countries, including precedent-shattering visits to rumania, yugoslavia and poland. around the globe america's alliances have been renewed and strengthened. a new spirit of partnership shows results m our nato partners' expenditures for the common defense - up by some $-billion in two years. historians may well regard these years as a golden age of american diplomacy. never before has our country negotiated with so many nations on so wide a range of subjects - and never with greater success. in the last four years we have concluded agreements: to limit nuclear weapons. to ban nuclear weapons from the world's seabeds. to reduce the risk of an accidental nuclear war. to end the threat of biological and toxin warfare. to terminate american responsibility for the administration of okinawa. to end the recurrent crises over berlin. to provide for u.s.-soviet cooperation in health and space research. to reduce the possibility of dangerous incidents at sea. to improve emergency communication between the white house and the kremlin. to exercise restraint in situations threatening conflict. to realign the world's currencies. to reduce barriers to american exports. to combat the international drug traffic. to protect the international environment. to expand cultural relations with peoples of eastern europe. to settle boundary disputes with mexico. to restore the water quality of the great lakes in cooperation with canada. in vietnam, too, our new policies have been dramatically effective. in the 's, our nation was plunged into another major war - for the fourth time in this century, the third time in a single generation. more than a half-million americans were fighting in vietnam in january . fatalities reached in a single week. there was no plan for bringing americans home, no hope for an end of the war. in four years, we have marched toward peace and away from war. our forces in vietnam have been cut by percent. no longer do we have a single ground combat unit there. casualties are down by percent. our young draftees are no longer sent there without their consent. through it all, we have not abandoned an ally to aggression, not turned our back on their brave defense against brutal invasion, not consigned them to the bloodbath that would follow communist conquest. by helping south vietnam build a capability to withstand aggression, we have laid the foundation for a just peace and a durable peace in southeast asia. from one sector of the globe to another, a sure and strong america, in partnership with other nations, has once again resumed her historic mission - the building of a lasting peace. the nixon doctrine. when president nixon came into office, america's foremost problem was the bloody, costly, divisive involvement in vietnam. but there was an even more profound task - to redefine the international role of the united states in light of new realities around the globe and new attitudes at home. precisely and clearly, the president stated a new conception of a positive american role. this - the nixon doctrine - is monumentally important to every american and to all other people in the world. the theme of this doctrine is that america will remain fully involved in world affairs, and yet do this in ways that will elicit greater effort by other nations and the sustaining support of our people. for decades, our nation's leaders regarded virtually every problem of local defense or economic development any place in the world as an exclusive american responsibility. the nixon doctrine recognizes that continuing defense and development are impossible unless the concerned nations shoulder the principal burden. yet strong economic and military assistance programs remain essential. without these, we are denied a middle course - the course between abruptly leaving allies to struggle along against economic stagnation or aggression, or intervening massively ourselves. we cannot move from the over-involvement of the sixties to the selective involvement of the seventies if we do not assist our friends to make the transition with us. in the nixon doctrine, therefore, we define our interests and commitments realistically and clearly; we offer not an abdication of leadership, but more rational and responsible leadership. we pledge that, under republican leadership, the united states will remain a leader in international affairs. we will continue to shape our involvement abroad to national objectives and realities in order to sustain a strong, effective american role in the world. over time we hope this role will eventually lead the peace-loving nations to undertake an exhaustive, coordinated analysis of the root causes of war and the most promising paths of peace, so that those causes may in time be removed and the prospects for enduring peace strengthened year by year. peace in the 's. we stand with our president for his strategy for peace - a strategy of national strength, a new sense of international partnership, a willingness to negotiate international differences. we will strengthen our relationships with our allies, recognizing them as full-fledged partners in securing the peace and promoting the common well-being. with our adversaries, we will continue to negotiate in order to improve our security, reduce tension, and extend the realm of cooperation. especially important is continued negotiation to maintain the momentum established by the strategic arms limitation agreements to limit offensive and defensive nuclear weapons systems and further to reduce the danger of nuclear conflict. in addition, we will encourage increased trade for the benefit of our consumers, businessmen, workers, and farmers. along with nato allies, we will seek agreement with the warsaw pact nations on a mutual and balanced reduction of military forces in europe. we will press for expansion of contacts with the people of eastern europe and the people's republic of china, so long isolated from most of the world. we will continue to seek a settlement of the vietnam war which will permit the people of southeast asia to live in peace under political arrangements of their own choosing. we take note of the remaining major obstacle to settlement - hanoi s demand that the united states overthrow the saigon government and impose a communist-dominated government on the south vietnamese. we stand unequivocally at the side of the president in his effort to negotiate honorable terms, and in his refusal to accept terms which would dishonor this country. we commend his refusal to perform this act of betrayal - and we most emphatically say the president of the united states should not go begging to hanoi. we believe that the presidents proposal to withdraw remaining american forces from vietnam four months after an internationally supervised ceasefire has gone into effect throughout indochina and all prisoners have been returned is as generous an offer as can be made by anyone - by anyone, that is, who is not bemused with surrender - by anyone who seeks, not a fleeting peace at whatever cost, but real peace that will be both just and lasting. we will keep faith with american prisoners of war held by the enemy, and we will keep faith, too, with their families here at home who have demonstrated remarkable courage and fortitude over long periods of uncertainty. we will never agree to leave the fate of our men unclear, dependent upon a cruel enemy's whim. on the contrary - we insist that, before all american forces are withdrawn from vietnam, american prisoners must he returned and a full accounting made of the missing in action and of those who have died in enemy hands. we pledge that upon repatriation our returned prisoners will be received in a manner befitting their valor and sacrifice. we applaud the administration's program to assure each returned prisoner the finest medical care, personal counseling, social services and career orientation. this around-the-clock personal service will ease their reintegration into american life. north vietnam's violation of the geneva convention in its treatment of our prisoners of war has called forth condemnation from leaders around the world - but not by our political opposition at home. we denounce the enemy's flagrant breach of international law and common decency. we will continue to demand full implementation of the rights of the prisoners. if north vietnam continues obdurately to reject peace by negotiation we shall nevertheless achieve peace for our country through the successful program of vietnamization, phasing out our involvement as our ally strengthens his defense against aggression. in the middle east, we initiated arrangements leading to a cease-fire which has prevailed for two years. we pledge very effort to transform the cease-fire into lasting peace. since world war ii, our country has played the major role in the international effort to assist the developing countries of the world. reform of our foreign assistance program to induce a greater international sharing of the aid effort, is long overdue the reforms proposed by the president have been approved only in part. we call for further reforms to make our aid more effective and protect the taxpayer's interests. we stand for an equitable, non-discriminatory immigration policy, reaffirming our support of the principles of the immigration act - non-discrimination against national origins, renunciation of families, and the selective admission of the specially talented. the immigration process must be just and orderly, and we will increase our efforts to halt the illegal entry of aliens into the united states. we also pledge to strengthen the agencies of international cooperation. we will help multilateral organizations focus on international issues affecting the quality of life - for example the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and the protection of man's cultural heritage and freedom of communication, as well as drug abuse, pollution, overpopulation, exploitation of the sea and seabeds, aircraft hijacking and international crime. we will seek to improve the performance of the united nations, including more objective leadership. we support a more equitable sharing of the costs of international organizations and have serious concerns over the delinquency of many un members in meeting their financial obligations. our country, which from its beginnings has proclaimed that all men are endowed with certain rights, cannot be indifferent to the denial of human rights anywhere in the world. we deplore oppression and persecution, the inevitable hallmarks of despotic systems of rule. we will continue to strive to bring them to an end, both to reestablish the rights of self-determination and to encourage where and when possible the political freedom of subjugated peoples everywhere in the world. we firmly support the right of all persons to emigrate from any country, and we have consistently upheld that doctrine. we are fully aware of and share the concern of many citizens for the plight of soviet jews with regard to their freedoms and emigration. this view, together with our commitment to the principles of the universal declaration of human rights of the united nations, was made known to soviet leaders during the president's discussions in moscow. the middle east. we support the right of israel and its courageous people to survive and prosper in peace. we have sought a stable peace for the middle east and helped to obtain a cease-fire which contained the tragic convict. we will help in any way possible to bring israel and the arab states to the conference table, where they may negotiate a lasting peace. we will continue to act to prevent the development of a military imbalance which would imperil peace in the region and elsewhere by providing israel with support essential for her security, including aircraft, training and modem and sophisticated military equipment, and also by helping friendly arab governments and peoples, including support for their efforts to diminish their dependence on outside powers. we support programs of economic assistance to israel pursued by president nixon that have helped her achieve a nine percent annual economic growth rate. this and the special refugee assistance ordered by the president have also helped to provide resettlement for the thousands of immigrants seeking refuge in israel. we will maintain our tactical forces in europe and the mediterranean area at adequate strength and high levels of efficiency. the irresponsible proposals of our political opposition to slash the defense forces of the united states specifically, by cutting the strength of our fleet, by reducing our aircraft carriers from to six and by unilateral withdrawals from europe - would increase the threat of war in the middle east and gravely menace israel. we flatly reject these dangerous proposals. with a settlement fair to all nations of the middle east, there would be an opportunity for their peoples to look ahead to shared opportunities rather than backward to rancorous animosities. in a new environment of cooperation, israel will be able to contribute much to economic renaissance in the mid-east crossroads of the world. the atlantic community. we place high priority on the strengthening of the north atlantic alliance. one of the president's first initiatives was to visit western european capitals to reinvigorate the nato alliance and indicate its importance in u.s. foreign policy. right now, with plaintive cries of ""come home america"" echoing a new isolationism, the republican party states its firm belief that no nation can be an island or a fortress unto itself. now, more than ever, there is need for interdependence among proven friends and old allies. the north atlantic alliance remains the strongest, most successful peacetime association ever formed among a group of free nations. the continued strengthening of the alliance will remain an important element in the foreign policies of the second nixon administration. japan. during the 's a number of economic and political issues developed in our country's relations with japan, our major ally in asia. to resolve these, president nixon terminated our responsibility for the administration of okinawa and initiated action to reduce our trade deficit with japan. we are consulting closely to harmonize our two countries' separate efforts to normalize relations with peking. in these ways we have shifted our vital alliance with japan to a more sustainable basis for the long term, recognizing that the maintenance of united states-japanese friendship advances the interests of both countries. the soviet union. over many years our relations with the soviet union have oscillated between superficial improvements and new crises. false hopes have been repeatedly followed by disillusioned confrontation. in the closing months of , our relations with the soviet union deteriorated steadily, forcing the cancellation of a scheduled presidential visit to moscow and immobilizing projected negotiations on strategic arms limitation. president nixon immediately began the difficult task of building a new relationship - one based on a realistic acceptance of the profound differences in the values and systems of our two nations. he moved decisively on key issues - such as the berlin problem and strategic arms limitation - so that progress in one area would add momentum to progress in other areas. the success of these efforts was demonstrated at the summit in moscow. agreements were reached on new areas of cooperation - public health, environmental control, space exploration and trade. the first historic agreements limiting strategic arms were signed last may in moscow, and the soviet union subscribed to a broad declaration of principles governing our relations. we pledge to build upon these promising beginnings in reorienting relations between the world's strongest nuclear powers to establish a truly lasting peace. china. in the 's it seemed beyond possibility that the united states could dispel the ingrained hostility and confrontation with the china mainland. president nixon's visit to the people's republic of china was, therefore, an historic milestone in his effort to transform our era from one of confrontation to one of negotiation. while profound differences remain between the united states and china, at least a generation of hostility has been replaced by frank discussions. in february rules of international conduct were agreed upon which should make the pacific region a more peaceful area now and in the future. both the people's republic and the united states affirmed the usefulness of promoting trade and cultural exchanges as ways of improving understanding between our two peoples. all this is being done without affecting our mutual defense treaty or our continued diplomatic relations with our valued friend and ally on taiwan, the republic of china. latin america. our common long-range interests, as well as history and geography, give the relations among nations of the western hemisphere a special importance. we will foster a more mature partnership among the nations of this hemisphere, with a wider sharing of ideas and responsibility, a broader understanding of diversities, and firm commitment to the common pursuit of economic progress and social justice. we believe the continuing campaign by cuba to foment violence and support subversion in other countries makes it ineligible for readmission to the community of american states. we look forward to the day when changes in cuba's policies will justify its re-entry into the american community - and to the day when the cuban people achieve again their freedom and their true independence. africa. our ties with africa are rooted in the heritage of many americans and in our historic commitment to self-determination. we respect the hard earned sovereignty of africa's new states and will continue to do our utmost to make a meaningful contribution to their development. we have no illusions that the united states can single-handedly solve the seemingly intractable problems of apartheid and minority rule, but we can and will encourage non-violent, evolutionary change by supporting international efforts peacefully to resolve the problems of southern africa and by maintaining our contacts with all races on the continent. defense we believe in keeping america strong. in times past, both major parties shared that belief. today this view is under attack by militants newly in control of the democratic party. to the alarm of free nations everywhere, the new democratic left now would undercut our defenses and have america retreat into virtual isolation, leaving us weak in a world still not free of aggression and threats of aggression. we categorically reject this slash-now, beg-later approach to defense policy. only a strong america can safely negotiate with adversaries. only a strong america can fashion partnerships for peace. president nixon has given the american people their best opportunity in this century to achieve lasting peace. the foundations are well laid. by adhering to a defense policy based on strength at home, partnership abroad and a willingness to negotiate everywhere, we hold that lasting peace is now achievable. we will surely fail if we go crawling to the conference table. military weakness is not the path to peace; it is invitation to war. a modern, well-equipped force. we believe that the first prerequisite of national security is a modem, well-equipped armed force. from to the vietnam war so absorbed the resources of the defense department that maintenance, modernization. and research and development fell into neglect. in the late 's the soviet union outspent the united states by billions of dollars for force modernization, facing the united states with the dangerous prospect that its forces would soon be qualitatively inferior. our reserve forces and the national guard had become a dumping ground for castoff arms and equipment. the military posture of our country became seriously undermined. to assure our strength and counter the mounting soviet threat, president nixon directed: the most significant ship construction and modernization program since world war ii; the development of new types of tactical aircraft such as the f-, a lightweight fighter, and a fighter plane for close support of ground troops; improvements in our strategic bomber force and development of the new b- strategic bomber; development of a new trident submarine and undersea missile system; greatly increasing the capability of existing strategic missiles through multiple warheads; strengthening of strategic defenses, including initial deployment of an anti-ballistic missile system; the largest research and development budget in history to ensure continued technological superiority; equipping of the national guard and reserves with the most modern and sophisticated weapons; improved command and control communications systems. we draw a sharp distinction between prudent reductions in defense spending and the meat-ax slashes with which some americans are not beguiled by the political opposition. specifically, we oppose plans to stop the minuteman iii and poseidon programs, reduce the strategic bomber force by some percent, cancel the b- bomber, reduce aircraft carriers from to , reduce tactical air wings by a third, and unilaterally reduce u.s. forces in europe by half. these slashes are worse than misguided; they are dangerous. they would torpedo negotiations on arms and troop reductions, create a crisis of confidence with our allies, damage our own industrial and technological capacity, destabilize europe and the middle east, and directly endanger the nation's security. a new partnership. the nixon doctrine has led to a new military strategy of realistic deterrence. its essence is the sharing of the responsibilities and the burdens of defense. this strategy is based on the efficient utilization of the total force available -- our own and our allies', and our civilian reserve elements as well as our regular forces. for years our country shouldered the responsibility for the defense of other nations. there were fears that we were attempting to be the policemen of the world. our country found it necessary to maintain a military force of . million persons more than a million overseas at , installations. a new partnership is emerging between the united states and other nations of the free world. other countries are assuming a much greater responsibility for the common defense. twice in the last two years our european allies have agreed to substantial increases in their support for nato forces. in asia we have been heartened by the efforts of the koreans, vietnamese, thais, nationalist chinese, australians, new zealanders and others who have sought improvements in their own forces. we have been able to reduce our military forces by more than one million men and women. we have cut by half the number deployed overseas, reduced overseas installations by more than percent, and sharply reduced the economic burden of defense spending from the vietnam high. all this has been done by virtue of our new security posture, without impairing our own or our allies' security. we pledge to press on toward a lasting peace. to that end we declare ourselves unalterably opposed to a unilateral slash of our military power, and we reject a whimpering ""come back america"" retreat into isolationism. an all-volunteer armed force. we wholeheartedly support an all-volunteer armed force and are proud of our historic initiatives to bring it to pass. four years ago, the president pledged to work toward an early end of the draft. that promise has been kept. today we approach a zero draft that will enlarge the personal freedom of millions of young americans. prior to , annual draft calls exceeded ,. the selective service system was inequitable in operation, and its rules caused prolonged uncertainty for young men awaiting call. since , the selective service system has been thoroughly reorganized, and local draft boards are more representative than ever before. today draftees are called by random selection of the youngest first, so that the maximum length of vulnerability is no longer seven years but one year only. youth advisor committees are in operation all across the country. of critical importance, we are nearing the elimination of draft calls altogether. in every year since , draft calls have been reduced. monthly draft calls are now down to a few thousand, and no draftees are sent involuntarily to vietnam. we expect to achieve our goal by july, . then, for the first time in a quarter-century, we hope and expect that young americans of all ages will be free from conscription. our political opponents have talked for years of their concern for young people. it is our republican administration that has taken the strong, effective action required to end the draft, with its many hardships and uncertainties for the youth of america. improvements in service life. we believe that the men and women in the uniformed services deserve the gratitude and respect of all americans and are entitled to better treatment than received in the past. for years most servicemen have been underpaid, harassed with restrictions, and afforded few opportunities for self-development. construction of military housing was allowed to fall badly behind. since improvements in service life have been many and major: the largest pay raises in military history have been enacted. while increases have been in all grades, the largest have gone to new recruits whose base pay will have risen more than percent by the end of this year. construction of new housing for military personnel and their families have increased sixfold since january . without sacrificing discipline, needlessly harsh, irksome and demeaning practices of the past have been abandoned. an effective program against dangerous drugs has been initiated. educational and training opportunities have been expanded. major strides have been made toward wiping out the last vestiges of racial discrimination. we regard these tasks as never completed, but we are well on the way and pledge ourselves to press forward assuring all men and women in the armed forces rewarding careers. better defense management. in the 's, the department of defense became administratively top-heavy and inefficient. the acquisition of new weapons systems was handled with inadequate attention to cost or performance, and there was little recognition of the human dimensions of the department. morale was low. our improvements have been many and substantial. healthy decentralization has taken place. the methods of acquiring new weapons systems have been reformed by such procedures as ""fly before you buy,"" the use of prototypes and the elimination of frills. service personnel and civilian employees are now treated as the most important asset of the department. we have sharply reduced defense spending. in , percent of the federal budget was spent for defense and percent for human resources. in the budget the proportions were reversed - percent for human resources, percent for defense. the defense budget imposes the smallest economic burden on the country of any defense budget in more than years, consuming only . percent of the estimated gross national product. arms limitation. we believe in limiting arms - not unilaterally. but by mutual agreement and with adequate safeguards. when the nixon administration began, the soviet union was rapidly building its strategic armaments, and any effort to negotiate limitations on such weapons seemed hopeless. the soviet build-up threatened the efficacy of our strategic deterrent. the nixon years have achieved a great breakthrough in the long-term effort to curb major armaments by international agreement and given new momentum to arms limitations generally. of greatest importance were agreements with the soviet leaders to limit offensive and defensive nuclear weapons. the salt accord established mutually agreed restraints between the united states and the soviet union and reduced tensions throughout the world. with approval of the salt agreements by the congress, negotiations will be resumed to place further restrictions on nuclear weapons, and talks will begin on mutual, balanced force reductions in europe. we believe it is imperative that these negotiations go forward under president nixon's continuing leadership. we pledge him our full support. for the future. we will continue the sound military policies laid down by the president - our policies which guard our interests but do not dissipate our resources in vain efforts to police the world. as stated by the president: we will maintain a nuclear deterrent adequate to meet any threat to the security of the united states or of our allies. we will help other nations develop the capability of defending themselves. we will faithfully honor all of our treaty commitments. we will act to defend our interests whenever and wherever they are threatened. but where our vital interests or treaty commitments are not involved our role will be limited. we are proud of the men and women who wear our country's uniform, especially of those who have borne the burden of fighting a difficult and unpopular war. here and now we reject all proposals to grant amnesty to those who have broken the law by evading military service. we reject the claim that those who fled are more deserving, or obeyed a higher morality, than those next in line who served in their places. in carrying out our defense policies, we pledge to maintain at all times the level of military strength required to deter conflict, to honor our commitments to our allies, and to protect our people and vital interests against all foreign threats. we will not let america become a second-class power, dependent for survival on the good will of adversaries. we will continue to pursue arms control agreements - but we recognize that this can be successful only if we maintain sufficient strength and will fail if we allow ourselves to slip into inferiority. a new prosperity jobs, inflation and the economy the goal of our party is prosperity, widely-shared, sustainable in peace. we stand for full employment - a job for everyone willing and able to work in an economy freed of inflation, its vigor not dependent upon war or massive military spending. under the president's leadership our country is once again moving toward these peacetime goals. we have checked the inflation which had started to skyrocket when our administration took office. making the difficult transition from inflation toward price stability and from war toward peace. we have brought about a rapid rise in both employment and in real income, and laid the basis for a continuing decline in the rate of unemployment. all americans painfully recall the grave economic troubles we faced in january . the federal budget in fiscal had a deficit of more than $ billion even though the economy was operating at capacity. predictably, consumer prices soared by an annual rate of . percent in the first quarter of . ""jawboning"" of labor and business had utterly failed. the inevitable tax increase had come too late. the kaleidoscope of ""great society"" programs added to the inflationary fires. our international competitive position slumped from a trade surplus of $ billion in to $ million in . foreign confidence in the value of the dollar plummeted. strategies and achievements. our administration took these problems head on, accepting the unpopular tasks of holding down the budget, extending the temporary tax surcharge, and checking inflation. we welcomed the challenge of reorienting the economy from war to peace, as the more than two and one-half million americans serving the military or working in defense-related industries had to be assimilated in the peacetime work force. at the same time, we kept the inflation fight and defense employment cuts from triggering a recession. the struggle to restore the health of our nation's economy required a variety of measures. most important, the administration developed and applied sound economic and monetary policies which provided the fundamental thrust against inflation. to supplement these basic policies, inflation alerts were published; a new national commission on productivity enlisted labor, business and public leaders against inflation and in raising real incomes through increased output per worker: proposed price increases in lumber, petroleum, steel and other commodities were modified. a new construction industry stabilization committee, with the cooperation of unions and management, braked the dangerously skyrocketing costs in the construction industry. positive results from these efforts were swift and substantial. the rate of inflation, more than percent in early , declined to less than percent in early . even so, the economic damage inflicted by past excesses had cut so deeply as to make a timely recovery impossible forcing the temporary use of wage and price controls. these controls were extraordinary measures, not needed in a healthy free economy, but needed temporarily to recapture lost stability. our mix of policies has worked. the nation's economic growth is once again strong and steady. the rate of increase of consumer prices is now down to . percent. on the employment front, expenditures for manpower pro. grams were increased from $. billion to a planned $. billion; new enrollees receiving training or employment under these programs were increased by more than half a million; computerized job banks were established in all cities; more than a million young people received jobs this summer through federal programs, percent more than last year; engineers, scientists and technicians displaced by defense reductions were given assistance under the nationwide technology mobilization and reemployment program; additional weeks of unemployment compensation were authorized; and a special revenue sharing program for manpower was proposed to train more people for more jobs - a program still shelved by the opposition congress. civilian employment increased at an annual rate of about . million from august to july . almost four and one-half million new civilian jobs have been added since president nixon took office, and total employment is at its highest level in history. the total productive output of the country increased at an annual rate of . percent in the second quarter of , the highest in many years. workers' real weekly take-home pay - the real value left after taxes and inflation - is increasing at an annual rate of . percent, compared to less than one percent from to . for the first time in six years real spendable income is going up, while the rate of inflation has been cut in half. time lost from strikes is at the lowest level in many years. the rate of unemployment has been reduced from . percent to . percent, lower than the average from through before the vietnam buildup began, and is being steadily driven down. in negotiation with other countries we have revalued the dollar relative to other currencies, helping to increase sales at home and abroad and increasing the number of jobs. we have initiated a reform of the international monetary and trading system and made clear our determination that this reform must lead to a strong united states position in the balance of trade and payments. the road ahead. we will continue to pursue sound economic policies that will eliminate inflation, further cut unemployment, raise real incomes, and strengthen our international economic position. we will fight for responsible federal budgets to help assure steady expansion of the economy without inflation. we will support the independent federal reserve board in a policy of non-inflationary monetary expansion. we have already removed some temporary controls on wages and prices and will remove them all once the economic distortions spawned in the late 's are repaired. we are determined to return to an unfettered economy at the earliest possible moment. we affirm our support for the basic principles of capitalism which underline the private enterprise system of the united states. at a time when a small but dominant faction of the opposition party is pressing for radical economic schemes which so often have failed around the world, we hold that nothing has done more to help the american people achieve their unmatched standard of living than the free enterprise system. it is our conviction that government of itself cannot produce the benefits to individuals that flow from our unique combination of labor, management and capital. we will continue to promote steady expansion of the whole economy as the best route to a long-term solution of unemployment. ate will devote every effort to raising productivity, primarily to raise living standards but also to hold down costs and pried and to increase the ability of american producers and workers to compete in world markets. in economic policy decisions, including tax revisions, we will emphasize incentives to work, innovate and invest; and research and development will have our full support. we are determined to improve federal manpower programs to reduce unemployment and increase productivity by providing better information on job openings and more relevant job training. additionally we reaffirm our commitment to removing barriers to a full life for the mentally and physically handicapped, especially the barriers to rewarding employment. we commit ourselves to the full educational opportunities and the humane care, treatment and rehabilitation services necessary for the handicapped to become fully integrated into the social and economic mainstream. we will press on for greater competition in our economy. the energetic antitrust program of the past four years demonstrates our commitment to free competition as our basic policy. the antitrust division has moved decisively to invalidate those ""conglomerate"" mergers which stifle competition and discourage economic concentration. the antitrust cases filed in fiscal year broke the previous one-year record of more than a decade ago, during another republican administration. we will pursue the start we have made for reform of the international monetary and trading system, insisting on fair and equal treatment. since the 's, it has been illegal for united states citizens to own gold. we believe it is time to reconsider that policy. the right of american citizens to buy, hold, or sell gold should be reestablished as soon as this is feasible. review of the present policy should, of course, take account of our basic objective of achieving a strengthened world monetary system. taxes and government spending we pledge to spread the tax burden equitably, to spend the federal revenues prudently, to guard against waste in spending, to eliminate unnecessary programs, and to make sure that each dollar spent for essential government services buys a dollar's worth of value. federal deficit spending beyond the balance of the full employment budget is one sure way to refuel inflation, and the prime source of such spending is the united states congress. because of its present procedures and particularly because of its present political leadership, congress is not handling federal fiscal policies in a responsible manner. the congress now permits its legislative committees - instead of its fiscal committees - to decide, independently of each other, how much should be devoted to individual programs. total federal spending is thus haphazard and uncontrolled. we pledge vigorous efforts to reform the congressional budgeting process. as an immediate first step, we believe the nation needs a rigid spending ceiling on federal outlays each fiscal year - a ceiling controlling both the executive branch and the congress - as president nixon strongly recommended when he submitted his fiscal budget. should the total of all appropriations exceed the ceiling, some or all of them would be reduced by executive action to bring the total within the ceiling. our tax system needs continual, timely reform. early in this administration we achieved the first comprehensive tax reform since . the record shows that as a result of the tax reform act of and the revenue act of : million low-income americans are removed from the federal income tax rolls. persons in the lowest income tax bracket will pay percent less this year than they would have paid, had the and tax reforms not been enacted; those in the $, to $, income range will pay percent less, and those with incomes above $, will pay about percent more. this year the tax reduction for a family of four earning $, a year will be $. in this fiscal year individual taxpayers will pay $ billion less in federal income taxes than they would have paid if the old tax rates and structures were still in force. the tax disadvantage of single taxpayers is sharply reduced and we urge further changes to assure full equality. working parents can now deduct more of their costs for the care of their children during working hours. the seven percent automobile excise tax is repealed, saving the new car buyer an average of $ and creating more jobs in that part of the economy. this is sound tax reform, the kind that more equitably spreads the tax burden and avoids incentive-destroying tax levels which would cripple the economy and put people out of work. we reject the deceitful tax ""reform"" cynically represented as one that would soak the rich, but in fact one that would sharply raise the taxes of millions of families in middle-income brackets as well. we reject as well the lavish spending promised by the opposition party which would more than double the present budget of the united states government. this. too, would cause runaway inflation or force heavy increases in personal taxes. taxes and government spending are inseparable. only if the taxpayers' money is prudently managed can taxes be kept at reasonable levels. when our administration took office, federal spending had been mounting at an average annual rate of percent - a rate we have cut almost in half. we urge the congress to serve all americans by cooperating with the president in his efforts to curb increases in federal spending - increases which will ordain more taxes or more inflation. since we have eliminated over $ billion of spending on unneeded domestic and defense programs. this large saving would have been larger still, had congress passed the federal economy act of which would have discontinued other programs. we pledge to continue our efforts to purge the government of these wasteful activities. tax reform must continue. during the next session of congress we pledge: to pursue such policies as revenue sharing that will allow property tax relief; further tax reform to ensure that the tax burden is fairly shared; a simplified tax system to make it easier for all of us to pay no more and no less than we rightly owe; prudent fiscal management, including the elimination of unnecessary or obsolete programs, to keep the tax burden to a minimum. international economic policy in tandem with our foreign policy innovations, we have transformed our international economic policy into a dynamic instrument to advance the interests of farmers, workers, businessmen and consumers. these efforts are designed to make the products of american workers and farmers more competitive in the world. within the last year we achieved the smithsonian agreements which revalued our currency, making our exports more competitive with those of our major trading partners, and we pledge continuing negotiations further to reform the international monetary system. we also established negotiations to expand foreign market access for products produced by united states workers, with further comprehensive negotiations committed for . as part of our effort to begin a new era of negotiations, we are expanding trade opportunities and the jobs related to them for american workers and businessmen. the president's summit negotiations, for example, yielded an agreement for the soviet purchase, over a three-year period, of a minimum of $ million in united states grains - the largest long-term commercial trade purchase agreement ever made between two nations. this amounts to a percent increase in grain exports by united states farmers. a u.s.-soviet commercial commission has been established, and negotiations are now underway as both countries seek a general expansion of trade. as we create a more open world market for american exports, we are not unmindful of dangers to american workers and industries from severe and rapid dislocation by changing patterns of trade. we have several agreements to protect these workers and industries - for example, for steel, beef, textiles and shoes. these actions, highly important to key american industries, were taken in ways that avoided retaliation by our trading partners and the resultant loss of american jobs. as part of this adjustment process, we pledge improvement of the assistance offered by government to facilitate readjustment on the part of workers, businessmen and affected communities. in making the world trading system a fairer one, we have vigorously enforced anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws to make them meaningful deterrents to foreign producers who would compete unfairly. the growth of multinational corporations poses both new problems and new opportunities in trade and investment areas. we pledge to ensure that international investment problems are dealt with fairly and effectively - including consideration of effects on jobs, expropriation and treatment of investors, as well as equitable principles of taxation. at the same time that we seek a better environment for american exports, we must improve our productivity and competitiveness. we must have a strong domestic economy with increased investment in new plants and equipment and an advancing technology. we pledge increased efforts to promote export opportunities, including coordination of tax policy and improved export financing techniques - designed to make america more competitive in exporting. of critical importance will be new legislative proposals to equip american negotiators with the tools for constructing an open and fair world trading system. we deplore the practice of locating plants in foreign countries solely to take advantage of low wage rates in order to produce goods primarily for sale in the united states. we will take action to discourage such unfair and disruptive practices that result in the loss of american jobs. small business small business, so vital to our economic system is free enterprise in its purest sense. it holds forth opportunity to the individual, regardless of race and color, to fulfill the american dream. the seed bed of innovation and invention, it is the starting point of many of the country's large businesses, and today its role in our increasingly technological economy is crucial. we pledge to sustain and expand that role. we have translated this philosophy into many beneficial actions. primarily through the small business administration, we have delivered financial assistance to small business at a dramatically increasing rate. today small business is receiving double the sba funds it was receiving when our administration took office. during the - fiscal years the agency loaned small business $.-billion - percent of the total amount loaned in the entire -year history of the small business administration. financial help to minorities has been more than tripled, and now more than percent of the sba dollar goes to minority business. procurement of federal contracts for small business has surged above $ billion. in his first year in office, the president established a task force to discover ways in which the prospects of the small businessman could be improved. the findings, reported to congress, were followed by legislative proposals to give small business tax and interest advantages, to provide incentives for more participation in small business, to make venture capital and long-term credit easier to obtain, and to open the doors for disadvantaged minorities to go into business for themselves. some of these measures have been signed into law. others are still in the hands of the indifferent opposition in control of congress. the results of our efforts have been significant. today small business is once again gaining ground. incorporations are at a record level and the number of business failures is dropping. the current new growth of small business is about , units a year. for tomorrow, the challenges are many. we will: continue to fill the capital gap in the small business community by increasing sba financing to upwards of $ billion next year. provide more incentives for the private sector to join with sba in direct action programs, such as lease guarantees, revolving lines of credit, and other sophisticated financial techniques, such as factoring and mortgage financing. increase sba's community development program so that growth-minded communities can help themselves by building industrial parks and shopping centers. continue the rejuvenation of the small business investment company (sbic) program, leading to greater availability of venture capital for new business enterprises. see that a fair share of all federal dollars spent on goods and services goes to small business. create established secondary financial markets for sba loans, affording ready liquidity for financial institutions and opening up more financial resources to small firms. through tax incentives, encourage the start-up of more new businesses, and work for a tax system that more fairly applies to small business. establish special programs that will permit small firms to comply with consumer, environmental, and other new government regulations without undue financial burden. improving the quality of life health care our goal is to enable every american to secure quality health care at reasonable cost. we pledge a balanced approach - one that takes into account the problems of providing sufficient medical personnel and facilities. last year president nixon proposed one of the most all-inclusive health programs in our history. but the opposition congress has dragged its feet and most of this program has yet to be enacted into law. to increase the supply of medical services, we will continues to support programs to help our schools graduate more physicians, dentists, nurses and allied health personnel, with special emphasis on family practitioners and others who deliver primary medical care. we will also encourage the use of such allied personnel as doctors' assistants, foster new area health education centers, channel more services into geographic areas which now are medically deprived, and improve the availability of emergency medical care. we note with pride that the president has already signed the most comprehensive health manpower legislation ever enacted. to improve efficiency in providing health and medical, care, we have developed and will continue to encourage a pluralistic approach to the delivery of quality health care including innovative experiments such as health maintenance organizations. we also support efforts to develop ambulatory medical care services to reduce hospitalization and keep costs down. to reduce the cost of health care, we stress our efforts to curb inflation in the economy; we will also expand the supply of medical services and encourage greater cost consciousness in hospitalization and medical care. in doing this we realize the importance of the doctor-patient relationship and the necessity of insuring that individuals have freedom of choice of health providers. to assure access to basic medical care for all our people, we support a program financed by employers, employees and the federal government to provide comprehensive health insurance coverage, including insurance against the cost of long-term and catastrophic illnesses and accidents and renal failure which necessitates dialysis, at a cost which all americans can afford. the national health insurance partnership plan and the family health insurance plan proposed by the president meet these specifications. they would build on existing private health insurance systems, not destroy them. we oppose nationalized compulsory health insurance. this approach would at least triple in taxes the amount the average citizen now pays for health and would deny families the right to choose the kind of care they prefer. ultimately it would lower the overall quality of health care for all americans. we believe that the most effective way of improving health in the long run is by emphasis on preventive measures. the serious physical fitness problem in our country requires urgent attention. the president recently reorganized the council on physical fitness and sports to increase the leadership of representatives of medicine, physical education, sports associations and school administrations. the republican party urges intensification of these efforts, particularly in the nation's school systems, to encourage widespread participation in effective physical fitness programs. we have initiated this nation's first all-out assault against cancer. led by the new national cancer institute, the drive to eliminate this cruel killer will involve federal spending of nearly $ million in fiscal year , almost twice the funding of just two years ago. we have also launched a major new attack on sickle cell anemia, a serious blood disorder afflicting many black americans, and developed a comprehensive program to deal with the menace of lead-based paint poisoning, including the screening of approximately ,, americans. we support expanded medical research to find cures for the major diseases of the heart, blood vessels, lungs and kidneys - diseases which now account for over half the deaths in the united states. we have significantly advanced efforts to combat mental retardation and established a national goal to cut its incidence in half by the year . we continue to support the concept of comprehensive community mental health centers. in this fiscal year $ million - almost three times the level - will be devoted to the staffing of community mental health centers serving a population of million people. we have intensified research on methods of treating mental problems, increasing our outlays from $ million in to approximately $ million for . we continue to urge extension of private health insurance to cover mental illness. we have also improved consumer protection, health education and accident prevention programs. and in moscow this year, president nixon reached an agreement with the soviet union on health research which may yield substantial benefits in many fields in the years ahead. education we take pride in our leadership these last four years in lifting both quality and equality in american education - from preschool to graduate school - working toward higher standards than ever before. our two most pressing needs in the 's are the provision of quality education for all children, and equitable financing of steadily rising costs. we pledge our best efforts to deal effectively with both. months ago president nixon sent congress a two-part comprehensive proposal on school busing. the first is the student transportation moratorium act of - legislation to halt immediately all further court-ordered busing and give congress time to devise permanent new arrangements for assuring desegregated, quality education. the details of such arrangements are spelled out in a companion bill, the equal educational opportunities act. this measure would: provide $. billion in federal aid funds to help promote quality education while preserving neighborhood schools; accord equal educational opportunities to all children; include an educational bill of rights for spanish-speaking people, american indians, and others who face special language problems in schools; offer, for the first time, a real chance for good schooling for the hundreds of thousands of children who live in urban centers; assure that the people's elected representatives in congress play their proper role in developing specific methods for protecting the rights guaranteed by the 14th amendment, rather than leaving this task to judges appointed for life. we are committed to guaranteeing equality of educational opportunity and to completing the process of ending de jure school segregation. at the same time, we are irrevocably opposed to busing for racial balance. such busing fails its stated objective - improved learning opportunities - while it achieves results no one wants - division within communities and hostility between classes and races. we regard it as unnecessary, counter-productive and wrong. we favor better education for all children, not more transportation for some children. we favor the neighborhood school concept. we favor the decisive actions the president has proposed to support these ends. if it is necessary to accomplish these purposes, we would favor consideration of an appropriate amendment to the constitution. in the field of school finance, we favor a coordinated effort among all levels of government to break the pattern of excessive reliance on local property taxes to pay educational costs. our nation's intellectual resources are remarkable for their strength and public availability. american intellectuals have at least two important historical roles of which we are deeply conscious. one is to inform the public, the other to assist government by thoughtful criticism and consultation. we affirm our confidence in these functions and especially in the free play of ideas and discourse which they imply. we cherish the nation's universities as centers of learning, as conservers of our culture, and as analysts of our society and its institutions. we will continue to strive to assure their economic well-being. the financial aid we have given and will continue to give in the form of funds for scholarships, research, building programs and new teaching methods must never be used as a device for imposing political controls on our schools. we believe that universities should be centers of excellence - that they should recruit faculty on the basis of ability to teach and admit students on the basis of ability to learn. yet, excellence can be too narrowly confined - abilities overlooked, and social conformity mistaken for educational preparation. we pledge continued support of collegiate and university efforts to insure that no group in our society - racial, economic, sexual or regional - is denied access to the opportunities of higher education. our efforts to remedy ancient neglect of disadvantaged groups will continue in universities as well as in society at large, but we distinguish between such efforts and quotas. we believe the imposition of arbitrary quotas in the hiring of faculties or the enrollment of students has no place in our universities; we believe quotas strike at the essence of the university. we recognize that the public should have access to the most rational and most effective kinds of education. vocational training should be available to both young and old. we emphasize the importance of continuing education, of trades and technologies, and of all the honorable vocations which provide the society with its basic necessities. such training must complement our more traditional forms of education; it will relieve the pressures on our universities and help us adapt to the rapid pace of technological change. perhaps more important, it will help to restore a public sense of importance to these essential jobs and trades. moreover, we believe our educational system should not instruct in a vacuum, unmindful that the students ultimately will engage in a career. our institutions of learning, from earliest years to graduate schools can perform a vital function by coupling an awareness of the worth of work to the delivery of fundamental education. we believe this kind of career education blended into our school curricula, can help to prevent the aimlessness and frustration now experienced by large numbers of young people who leave the education system unable to cope with today's complex society. in recognizing the fundamental necessity for quality education of all children, including the exceptional child, we recommend research and assistance in programs directed to the problems of dyslectic and hyperkinetic children who represent an estimated ten percent of the school population. by every measure, our record in the field of education is exceptionally strong. the united states office of education is operating this year under its highest budget ever - some $. billion. federal aid to elementary and secondary education has increased percent over the past four years. federal aid for college students has more than tripled. we are proud of these accomplishments. we pledge to carry them forward in a manner consistent with our conviction that the federal government should assist but never control the educational process. but we also believe that the output of results, not the input of dollars, is the best yardstick of effectiveness in education. when this administration took office in , it found american schools deficient at many points. our reform initiatives have included: an office of child development to coordinate all federal programs targeted on the first five years of life and to make the head start program work better; a right to read program, aimed at massive gains in reading ability among americans of all ages; a career education curriculum which will help to prepare students for the world of work; a national institute of education to be a center for research on the learning process; and a proposed national foundation for higher education. we have also proposed grant and loan programs to support a national commitment that no qualified student should be barred from college by lack of money. the education amendment of embodied substantial portions of that proposal and marked the nation's most far-reaching commitment to make higher education available to all. our non-public schools, both church-oriented and nonsectarian, have been our special concern. the president has emphasized the indispensable role these schools play in our educational system - from the standpoints of the large numbers of pupils they serve, the competition and diversity they help to maintain in american education, and the values they help to teach - and he has stated his determination to help halt the accelerating trend of non-public school closures. we believe that means which are consistent with the constitution can be devised for channeling public financial aid to support the education of all children in schools of their parents' choice, non-public as well as public. one way to provide such aid appears to be through the granting of income tax credits. for the future, we also pledge special revenue sharing for education, continued work to develop and implement the career education concept, and continued efforts to establish a student financial aid system to bring higher education within the reach of any qualified person. welfare reform the nation's welfare system is a mess. it simply must be reformed. this system, essentially unchanged since the 's, has turned into a human and fiscal nightmare. it penalizes the poor. it provides discriminatory benefits. it kills any incentives its victims might have to work their way out of the morass. among its victims are the taxpayers. since the federal cost of welfare has skyrocketed over times - from slightly over $ billion then to more than $ billion now. state and local costs add to this gigantic expenditure. and here are the things are paying for: the present system drains work incentive from the employed poor, as they see welfare families making as much or more on the dole. its discriminatory benefits continue to ensnare the needy, aged, blind and disabled in a web of inefficient rules and economic contradictions. it continues to break up poor families, since a father's presence makes his family ineligible for benefits in many states. its dehumanizing lifestyle thus threatens to envelop yet another ""welfare generation ."" its injustices and costs threaten to alienate taxpayer super port for welfare programs of any kind. perhaps nowhere else is there a greater contrast in policy and philosophy than between the administration's remedy for the welfare ills and the financial orgy proposed by our political opposition. president nixon proposed to change our welfare system ""to provide each person with a means of escape from welfare into dignity."" his goals were these: a decent level of payment to genuinely needy welfare recipients regardless of where they live. incentives not to loaf, but to work. requiring all adults who apply for welfare to register for work and job training and to accept work or training. the only exceptions would be the aged, blind and disabled and mothers of preschool children. expanding job training and child care facilities so that recipients can accept employment. temporary supplements to the incomes of the working poor to enable them to support their families while continuing to work. uniform federal payment standards for all welfare recipients. in companion actions, our efforts to improve the nutrition of poor people resulted in basic reforms in the food stamp program. the number of recipients increased from some three million to million, and now . million needy children participate in the school lunch program, almost three times the number that participated in . now, nearly , nutrition aides work in low-income communities. in there were none. since , we have increased the federal support for family planning threefold. we will continue to support expanded family planning programs and will foster research in this area so that more parents will be better able to plan the number and spacing of their children should they wish to do so. under no circumstances will we allow any of these programs to become compulsory or infringe upon the religious conviction or personal freedom of any individual. we all feel compassion for those who through no fault of their own cannot adequately care for themselves. we all want to help these men, women and children achieve a decent standard of living and become self-supporting. we continue to insist, however, that there are too many people on this country's welfare rolls who should not be there. with effective cooperation from the congress, we pledge to stop these abuses. we flatly oppose programs or policies which embrace the principle of a government-guaranteed income. we reject as unconscionable the idea that all citizens have the right to be supported by the government, regardless of their ability or desire to support themselves and their families. we pledge to continue to push strongly for sound welfare reform until meaningful and helpful change is enacted into law by the congress. law enforcement we have solid evidence that our unrelenting war on crime is being won. the american people know that once again the thrust of justice in our society will be to protect the law-abiding citizenry against the criminal, rather than absolving the criminal of the consequences of his own desperate acts. serious crimes rose only one percent during the first quarter of this year - down from six percent last year and percent the year before. from to major crime went up percent. the tact is, in the first quarter of , of our largest cities had an actual decline in reported crime. in our nation's capitol, our anti-crime programs have been fully implemented. through such measures as increased police, street lighting, a narcotics treatment administration, court reform and special prosecuting units for major offenders we have steadily dropped the crime rate since november . by the first quarter of this year, the serious crime rate was down to half its all-time high. when our administration took office, a mood of lawlessness was spreading rapidly, undermining the legal and moral foundations of our society. we moved at once to stop violence in america. we have: greatly increased federal aid to state and local law enforcement agencies across the country, with more than $. billion spent on , crime-fighting projects. augmented justice department funding four-fold and provided more marshals, more judges, more narcotics agents, more assistant united states attorneys in the field. raised the law enforcement assistance administration budget ten-fold, earmarking $ million of the $ million for to upgrade state and local police and courts through revenue sharing. added new special agents to the fbi. raised federal spending on juvenile delinquency from $ million to more than $ million and proposed legislation to launch a series of model youth services. appointed attorneys general with a keen sense of the rights of both defendants and victims, and determination to enforce the laws. appointed judges whose respect for the rights of the accused is balanced by an appreciation of the legitimate needs of law enforcement. added to the supreme court distinguished lawyers of firm judicial temperament and fidelity to the constitution. even more fundamentally, we have established a renewed climate of respect for law and law enforcement. now those responsible for enforcing the law know they have the full backing of their government we recognize that programs involving work release, study release and halt-way houses have contributed substantially to the rehabilitation of offenders and we support these programs. we further support training programs for the staffs in our correctional institutions and will continue to see that minority group staff members are recruited to work in these institutions. the fight against organized crime. to most of us, organized criminal activity seems remote and unreal - yet syndicates supply the narcotics pushed on our youth, corrupt local officials, terrify legitimate businesses and fence goods stolen from our homes. this administration strongly supported the organized crime control act of , and under our strike force concept we have combined federal enforcement agencies to wage a concerted assault on organized crime. we have expanded the number of these strike forces and set a high priority for a new campaign against the syndicates. last year we obtained indictments against more than , members or associates of organized crime syndicates - more than triple the number indicted in . at last we have the lawless elements in our society on the run. the republican party intends to keep them running. rehabilitation of offenders. we have given the rehabilitation of criminal offenders more constructive, top-level attention than it has received at any time in our nation's history. in november , the president ordered a ten-year improvement program in prison facilities, correctional systems and rehabilitation methods and procedures. we believe the correctional system not only should punish, but also should educate and rehabilitate. we are determined to press ahead with reform of the system to make it more effective against crime. almost a decade of inadequate federal support of law enforcement has left deep scars in our society, but now a new mood pervades the country. civil disorders and campus violence are no longer considered inevitable. today, we see a new respect for law and order. our goal is justice - for everyone. we pledge a tireless campaign against crime - to restore safety to our streets, and security to law-abiding citizens who have a right to enjoy their homes and communities free from fear. we pledge to: continue our vigorous support of local police and law enforcement agencies, as well as federal law enforcement agencies. seek comprehensive procedural and substantive reform of the federal criminal code. accelerate the drive against organized crime. increase the funding of the federal judiciary to help clear away the logjam in the courts which obstructs the administration of justice. push forward in prison reform and the rehabilitation of offenders. intensify efforts to prevent criminal access to all weapons, including special emphasis on cheap, readily-obtainable handguns, retaining primary responsibility at the state level, with such federal law as necessary to enable the states to meet their responsibilities. safeguard the right of responsible citizens to collect, own and use firearms for legitimate purposes, including hunting, target shooting and self-defense. we will strongly support efforts of all law enforcement agencies to apprehend and prosecute to the limit of the law all those who use firearms in the commission of crimes. drug abuse. the permissiveness of the 's left no legacy more insidious than drug abuse. in that decade narcotics became widely available, most tragically among our young people. the use of drugs became endowed with a sheen of false glamour identified with social protest. by the time our nation awakened to this cancerous social ill, it found no major combat weapons available. soon after we took office, our research disclosed there were perhaps hundreds of thousands of heroin users in the united states. their cravings multiplied violence and crime. we found many more were abusing other drugs, such as amphetamines and barbiturates. marijuana had become commonplace. all this was spurred by criminals using modern methods of mass distribution against outnumbered authorities lacking adequate countermeasures. we quickly launched a massive assault against drug abuse. we intercepted the supply of dangerous drugs at points of entry and impeded their internal distribution. the budget for international narcotics control was raised from $ million to over $ million. narcotics control coordinators were appointed in united states embassies overseas to work directly with foreign governments in stopping drug traffic. we have narcotics action agreements with over countries. turkey has announced a total ban on opium production and, with our cooperation, france has seized major heroin laboratories and drugs. to inhibit the distribution of heroin in our own country, we increased the law enforcement budget for drug control more than times - from $ million to $ million. we are disrupting major narcotics distribution in wholesale networks through the combined efforts of the bureau of narcotics and dangerous drugs, customs operations at our borders, and a specially created unit of over internal revenue agents who conduct systematic tax investigations of targeted middle and upper echelon traffickers, smugglers, and financiers. last january, we established the office of drug abuse law enforcement to disrupt street and mid-level heroin traffickers. we established the ""heroin hot line"" - a nationwide toll free phone number (/-) - to give the public a single number for reporting information on heroin pushers. last year we added , more federal narcotics agents, and the bureau of narcotics and dangerous drugs has trained over , state and local personnel. and we are getting results. this past year four times as much heroin was seized as in the year this administration took office. since , the number of drug-related arrests has nearly doubled. for drug abuse prevention and treatment we increased the budget from $ million to over $ million. the demand for illicit drugs is being reduced through a massive effort directed by a newly created office in the white house. federally funded drug treatment and rehabilitation programs were more than doubled last fiscal year, and federal programs now have the capacity to treat more than , drug abusers a year. to alert the public, particularly the youth, to the dangers of drugs, we established a national clearinghouse for drug abuse information in as well as a $. million drug education and training program. we realize that the problem of drug abuse cannot be quickly solved, but we have launched a massive effort where practically none existed before. nor will we relax this campaign: we pledge to seek further international agreements to restrict the production and movement of dangerous drugs. we pledge to expand our programs of education, rehabilitation, training, and treatment. we will do more than ever before to conduct research into the complex psychological regions of disappointment and alienation which have led many young people to turn desperately toward drugs. we firmly oppose efforts to make drugs easily available. we equally oppose the legalization of marijuana. we intend to solve problems, not create bigger ones by legalizing drugs of unknown physical impact. we pledge the most intensive law enforcement war ever waged. we are determined to drive the pushers of dangerous drugs from the streets, schools, and neighborhoods of america. agriculture and rural life our agriculture has become the economic marvel of the world. our american farmers and ranchers have tripled per worker production in the last years, while non-farm industries have increased theirs a little over half. yet when we took office three and a half years ago, the farm community was being shockingly shortchanged for its remarkable achievements. inflation was driving up both the cost of farming and the cost of living - indeed, driving up all prices except the prices of products the farmers were taking to market. overall farm income was down. farm exports were low. bureaucratic planting regulations were oppressive. all across the country family farms were failing. our moves to deal with these problems have been numerous and effective. the rate of inflation has been curbed without forcing down prices for commodities, even as we have stepped up our drive against rising food costs in the cities. net farm income has soared to a record high of more than billion. during these republican years average net farm income has been over $ billion a year higher than during the last two administrations. for the same period average income per farm is up more than percent. and farm exports now stand at a record $ billion, sharply up from the $. billion when we took office. operating loans to help young farmers have reached the highest levels in history. administration-backed legislation has given farmers much greater freedom to plant what they choose and we have given assistance to cooperatives to strengthen the farmers' bargaining positions. rural development has been energetically carried forward, and small towns and rural areas have been helped to adjust and grow. the loan programs of the farmers home administration for farm and rural people have been dramatically increased. electric and telephone service in rural areas has beep substantially expanded, a rural telephone bank has beer enacted, and the farm credit administration has been streamlined. the total national investment in rural development has almost tripled. heading the department of agriculture have been leaders who understand and forcefully speak out for the farming people of america. farmers are benefitting markedly from our successful relief efforts to expand exports - notably a $ million sale of united states grains to the soviet union, with prospects of much more. last year we negotiated a similar sale amounting to $ million. for the future, we pledge to intensify our efforts to: achieve a $ billion annual export market by opening new foreign markets, while continuing to fight for fair treatment for american farm products in our traditional markets. follow sound economic policies to break inflation and reduce interest rates; expand activities to assist farmers in bargaining for fair prices and reasonable terms in a rapidly changing marketing system; keep farm prices in the private sector, not subject to price controls; support family farms as the preferred method of organizing agricultural production, and protect them from the unfair come petition of farming by tax-loss corporations and non-farm enterprises; reform federal estate tax laws, which often force the precipitate sale of family farms to help pay the tax, in such ways as to help support the continuance of family farms as institutions of great importance to the american way of life; provide greater credit, technical assistance, soil and water conservation aid, environmental enhancement, economic stimulus, and sympathetic leadership to america's rural areas and communities; concentrate research on new uses of agricultural products; continue assistance to farm cooperatives, in their efforts to improve their services to their members; develop land and water policy that takes account of the many uses to which these resources may be put; establish realistic environmental standards which safeguard wise resource use, while avoiding undue burdens on farmers; use forums of national leaders to create a better understanding by all citizens, those in the cities and suburbs as well as those in small towns, of the difficult problems confronting farm and ranch families in a modern agriculture. we will not relax our efforts to increase net farm income, to narrow the spread between farm and non-farm income levels, and to pursue commodity programs that will enable farmers and ranchers to receive fair prices for what they produce. : community development for more than a quarter century the federal government has sought to assist in the conservation and rebuilding of our urban centers. yet, after the spending of billions of dollars and the commitment of billions more to future years, we now know that many existing programs are unsuited to the complex problems of the 's. programs cast in the mold of the big government philosophy of the 's are simply incapable of meeting the challenges of today. our party stands, therefore, for major reform of federal community development programs and the development of a new philosophy to cope with urban ills. republican urban strategy rejects throwing good money after bad money. instead, through fundamental fiscal, management and program reforms, we have created a new federal partnership through which state, county and municipal governments can best cope with specific problems such as education, crime, drug abuse, transportation, pollution and housing. we believe the urban problems of today fall into these categories: the fiscal crises of state, county, and municipal governments. the need for a better quality and greater availability of urban services. the continual requirement of physical development. the need for better locally designed. locally implemented, locally controlled solutions to the problems of individual urban areas. in the last category - the importance of grass roots planning and participation - our republican party has made its most important contribution to solving urban problems. we hold that government planners should be guided by the people through their locally elected representatives. we believe that real solutions require the full participation of the private sector. to help ease the fiscal crises of state, county and municipal governments, we pledge increased federal assistance - assistance we have more than doubled in the past four years. and, as stressed elsewhere in this platform, we remain committed to general revenue sharing, which could reduce the oppressive property tax. our proposals for special revenue sharing for urban development, transportation, manpower and law enforcement - all still bottled up by the opposition congress - are designed to make our towns and cities places where americans can once again the and work without physical or environmental hazard. urban areas are already benefiting from major funding increases which we fought for in the law enforcement assistance administration programs and in our $-billion mass transit program. urban areas are also benefiting from our new legacy of parks program, which is bringing recreational opportunities closer to where people live. we are committed also to the physical development of urban areas. we have quadrupled subsidized housing starts for low and moderate income families since , and effected substantial increases for construction of municipal waste treatment facilities we strongly oppose the use of housing or community development programs to impose arbitrary housing patterns on unwilling communities. neither do we favor dispersing large numbers of people away from their homes and neighborhoods against their will. we do believe in providing communities, with their full consent, guidance and cooperation, with the means and incentives to increase the quantity and quality of housing in conjunction with providing increased access to jobs for their low income citizens. we also pledge to carry forward our policy of encouraging the development of new towns in order to afford all americans a wider range of residential choices. additionally, our special revenue sharing for urban and rural community development, together with general revenue sharing and nation-wide welfare reform, are basic building blocks for a balanced policy of national growth, leading to better lives for all americans, whether they dwell in cities, suburbs or rural areas. our party recognizes counties as viable units of regional government with a major role in modernizing and restructuring local services, eliminating duplication and increasing local cooperation. we urge federal and state governments, in implementing national goals and programs, to utilize the valuable resources of counties as area-wide, general-purpose governments. housing our republican administration has made more and better housing available to more of our citizens than every before. we are building two-and-a-third million new homes a year - percent more than the average in the eight years of the two previous administrations. progress has not been in numbers alone; housing quality has also risen to an all-time high - far above that of any other country. we will maintain and increase this pattern of growth. we are determined to attain the goal of a decent home for every american. significant number of americans still lack the means for decent housing, and in such cases - where special need exists - we will continue to apply public resources to help people acquire better apartments and homes. we further pledge: continued housing production for low and moderate income families, which has sharply increased since president nixon took office. improvement of housing subsidy programs and expansion of mortgage credit activities of federal housing agencies as necessary to keep americans the best-housed people in the world. continued development of technological and management innovations to lower housing costs - a program begun by operation breakthrough, which is assisting in the development of new methods for more economical production of low-cost, high-quality homes. we urge prompt action by state, county and municipal governments to seek solutions to the serious problems caused by abandoned buildings in urban areas. transportation when president nixon took office a crisis in transportation was imminent, as indicated by declining mass transportation service, mounting highway deaths, congested urban streets, long delays at airports and airport terminals, deterioration of passenger train service, and a dwindling merchant marine. within two years the president had proposed and signed into law: a $-billion, -year program - the urban mass transportation act of - to infuse new life into mass transportation systems and help relieve urban congestion; a major -year program involving $-million annually for airport development projects as well as an additional $ million annually to expand airways systems and facilities; the rail passenger service act of to streamline and improve the nation's passenger train service; new research and development projects, including automatic people movers, improved metroliner and turbo-trains, quieter aircraft jet engines, air pollution reduction for mass transportation vehicles, and experimental safety automobiles. we strongly support these research and development initiatives of the department of transportation. four years ago we called attention to the decline of our merchant marine due to previous neglect and apathy. we promised a vigorous ship replacement program to meet the changing pattern of our foreign commerce. we also pledged to expand maritime research and development and the simplification and revision of construction and operating subsidy procedures. by the enactment of the merchant marine act of , we have reversed the long decline of our merchant marine. we reaffirm our goals set forth in and anticipate the future development of a merchant fleet that will give us defensive mobility in time of emergency as well as economic strength in time of peace. to reduce traffic and highway deaths, the national highway traffic safety administration has been reorganized and expanded, with dramatic results. in , the number of traffic deaths per hundred million miles driven was the lowest in history. to help restore decision-making to the people, we have proposed a new single urban fund providing almost $-billion a year by to state and metropolitan areas to assist local authorities in solving their own transportation problems in their own way. our proposal for special revenue sharing for transportation would also help governments close to the people meet local needs and provide greater freedom to achieve a proper balance among the nation's major transportation modes. to revitalize the surface freight transportation industry, we have recommended measures to modernize railway equipment and operations and to update regulatory practices. these measures, on which congress still dawdles, would help curb inflation by saving the public billions of dollars a year in freight costs. their enactment would also expand employment and improve our balance of trade. the nation's transportation needs are expected to double in the next years. our party will continue to pursue policies and programs that will meet these needs and keep the country well ahead of rapidly changing transportation demands. environment in january , we found the federal government woefully unprepared to deal with the rapidly advancing environmental crisis. our response was swift and substantial. first, new decision-making organizations were set in place - the first council on environmental quality, the environmental protection agency, the national oceanic and atmospheric administration. we also proposed a new department of natural resources, but congress has failed to act. we also created a national industrial pollution control council to enlist the private sector more actively against environmental decay, and a presidential federal property review board was appointed to ferret out federal property for transfer to local park recreational uses. second, we gave top priority in the federal budget to environmental improvements. this fiscal year approximately $.-billion will be expended for major environmental programs, three times more than was being spent when president nixon took office. third, sweeping environment messages were sent to congress in , and covering air quality, water quality, toxic waste substances, ocean dumping, noise, solid waste management, land use, parklands and many other environmental concerns. almost all of these proposals still languish in the opposition congress. although the president cannot move until and unless congress passes laws in many of these areas, he nevertheless can act - and has acted - forcefully on many fronts: he has directed the federal government to practice ecological leadership by using low-lead gasoline and recycled paper. he has cracked down on flagrant polluters, greatly increasing prosecutions and making the first use of federal authority to shut down major industries during an air pollution crisis. the fragile and unique everglades were saved from a jetport. pesticide abuses were curtailed. strict new clean air standards were set, and in many urban centers the air is improving. regulations were issued to make one grade of lead-free and phosphorous-free gasoline available throughout the nation by july , , and a phased reduction was required in the lead content of regular and premium gasolines. auto makers were required to design air pollution control systems to assure that vehicles comply with federal emission standards throughout their useful life. additionally, the president launched the legacy of parks program to convert under-utilized federal properties to park and recreational use, with special emphasis on new parks in or near urban areas. more than areas have already been made available to states, counties and municipalities for such use including priceless stretches of ocean beach. moreover, nearly two million acres of land have been purchased by federal state and local governments for recreation and for historical and natural preservation purposes. a system of recreational trails for hiking, bicycling and horseback riding will help meet the pressing recreational needs of our increasingly urbanized society. many state, county and municipal governments are developing bicycle, hiking, and horseback trails with our active assistance through various federal programs. we pledge our continued commitment to seeking out practical ways for more and safer bicycling opportunities within our cities and metropolitan areas. we have also provided effective leadership in international environmental activity. the president has negotiated the great lakes water quality agreement with canada and a cooperative agreement on environmental protection with the soviet union. the united nations conference on the human environment in stockholm adopted our government's initiatives for the creation of an international fund for the environment, a continuing united nations agency for environmental problems, and the control of ocean dumping. our president has led the effort for a ten-year moratorium on commercial whaling everywhere in the world. we call upon the congress to act promptly on the president's environmental proposals still stalled there - more than in all. these include: legislation to control, and in some cases prohibit, the dumping of wastes into the oceans, estuaries and the great lakes. a federal noise control act to reduce and regulate unwanted sound from aircraft, construction and transportation equipment. authority to control hundreds of chemical substances newly marketed each year. legislation to encourage the states to step up to pressing decisions on how best to use land. both environmentally critical areas such as wetlands and growth-inducing developments such as airports would have particular scrutiny. a proposal to provide for early identification and protection of endangered wildlife species. this would, for the first time, make the taking of endangered species a federal offense. establishment of recreational areas near metropolitan centers such as the gateway national recreational area in new york and new jersey and the golden gate national recreation area in and around san francisco bay. the nostalgic notion of turning the clock back to a simpler time may be appealing but is neither practical nor desirable we are not going to abandon the automobile, but we are going to have a clean-burning engine. we are not going to give up electric lighting and modern industry, but we do expect cleanly-produced electric power to run them. we are not going to be able to do without containers for our foods and minerals, but we can improve them and make them reusable or biodegradable. we pledge a workable balance between a growing economy and environmental protection. we will resolve the conflicts sensibly within that framework. we commit ourselves to comprehensive pollution control laws, vigorous implementation of those laws, and rigorous research into the technological problems of pollution control. the beginnings we have made in these first years of the 's are evidence of our determination to follow through. we intend to leave the children of america a legacy of clean air, clean water, vast open spaces and easily accessible parks. natural resources and energy. wilderness areas forests, fish and wildlife are precious natural resources. we have proposed new wilderness areas, adding another . million acres to the national wilderness preservation system. we have made tough new proposals to protect endangered species of wildlife. public lands provide us with natural beauty, wilderness, and great recreational opportunities as well as minerals, timber, food and fiber. we pledge to develop and manage these lands in a balanced way, both to protect the irreplaceable environment and to maximize the benefits of their use to our society. we will continue these conservation efforts in the years ahead. we recognize and commend the humane societies and the animal welfare societies in their work to protect animals. water supplies are not a boundless resource. the republican party is committed to developing additional water supplies by desalinization. the discovery of new groundwater stocks recycling and wiser and more efficient use of the waters we have. we will continue the development of flood control, navigation improvement and reclamation projects based on valid cost-benefit estimates, including full consideration of environmental concerns. no modern nation can thrive without meeting its energy needs. and our needs are vast and growing. last year we proposed a broad range of actions to facilitate research and development for clean energy. provide energy resources on federal lands, assure a timely supply of nuclear fuels, use energy more efficiently, balance environmental and energy needs. and better organize federal efforts. the national minerals policy act of encourages development of domestic resources by private enterprise. a program to tap our vast shale resources has been initiated consistent with the national environmental policy act of . we need a department of natural resources to continue to develop a national, integrated energy policy and to administer and implement that policy as the united states approaches the 21st century. energy sources so vitally important to the welfare of our nation are becoming increasingly interchangeable. there is nothing inherently incompatible between an adequate energy supply and a healthy environment. indeed, vast quantities of energy are needed to do the work necessary to clean up our air and streams. without sufficient supplies of power we will not be able to attain our goals of reducing unemployment and poverty and enhancing the american standard of living. responsible government must consider both the short-term and the long-run aspects of our energy supplies. avoidance of brownouts and power disruptions now and in the future call for sound policies supporting incentives that will encourage the exploration for. and development of, our fossil fuels. such policies will buy us time to develop the sophisticated and complex technologies needed to utilize the exotic energy sources of the future. national security and the importance of a favorable balance of trade and balance of payments dictate that we must rot permit our nation to become overly dependent on foreign sources of energy. since more than half our nation's domestic fossil resources now lie under federal lands, high priority must be given to the governmental steps necessary to the development of these resources by private industry. a liquid metal fast breeder reactor demonstration plant to be built with the financial support of the atomic energy commission, the electric power industry, and the tennessee alley authority. we will accelerate research on harnessing thermo-nuclear energy and continue to provide leadership in the production of energy from the sun and geothermal steam. we recognize the serious problem of assuring adequate electric generating capacity in the nation, and pledge to meet this need without doing violence to our environment. oceans. the oceans are a vast, largely untapped reservoir of resources, a source of food, minerals, recreation and pleasure, with great potential for economic development. for their maintenance we must: encourage the development of coastal zone management systems by the states, in cooperation with the federal government, to preserve the coastal environment while allowing for its prudent social and economic development. protect the oceans from pollution through the creation of binding domestic and international legal and institutional arrangements. foster arrangements to develop the untapped mineral resources of the seas in an equitable and environmentally sound manner. establish domestic and international institutions for the management of the ocean fisheries. fishing in international waters, a way of life for many americans, must be maintained without harassment on the high seas or unreasonable restrictions. protect and conserve marine mammals and other marine species to ensure their abundance and especially to protect species whose survival is endangered maintain a national capability in ocean science and technology and, through the united nations conference on the law of the sea, work to codify an international legal framework for the peaceful conduct of ocean activities. science and technology basic and applied scientific research and development are indispensable to our national security, our international competitive position, and virtually every aspect of the domestic economy. we have initiated a new research and development strategy which emphasizes a public-private partnership in searching out new ideas and technologies to create new jobs, new internationally competitive industries, and new solutions for complex domestic problems. in support of this strategy we have increased federal efforts in civilian research and development by percent - from $.-billion to $.-billion - and expanded research in drug abuse, law enforcement, health care, home building, motor vehicle safety, energy, and child development as well as many other fields. we will place special emphasis on these areas in which breakthroughs are urgently needed: abundant, clean energy sources; safe, fast and pollution-free transportation; improved emergency health care; reduction of loss of life, health and property in natural disasters; rehabilitation of alcoholics and addicts to dangerous drugs. additionally, we urge the fair and energetic enforcement of all fire prevention laws and applaud the work of the national commission on fire prevention and control. we encourage accelerated research on methods of fire prevention and suppression, including studies on flammable fabrics, hazardous materials, fire equipment and training procedures. the space program is yielding impressive dividends in earth-oriented applications of space technology - advances in medicine, industrial techniques and consumer products that would still be unknown had we not developed the technology to reach the moon. we will press ahead with the space shuttle program to replace today's expendable launch vehicles and provide low-cost access to space for a wide variety of missions, including those related to earth resources. we pledge to continue to extend our knowledge of the most distant frontiers in space. we will also extend our exploration of the seabed and the sea. we will seek food for the hungry, power for future technologies, new medicines for the sick, and new treatments of water for arid regions of the world. the quantities of metals and minerals needed to maintain our economic health and living standards are so huge as to require the re-use of all recoverable commodities from solid waste materials. we pledge a vigorous program of research and development in order to seek out more economical methods to recover and recycle such commodities, including the processing of municipal solid wastes. we pledge to extend the communications frontier, and to foster the development of orbiting satellite systems that will make possible wholly new, world-wide educational and entertainment programs. we recognize that the productivity of our nation's research and development efforts can be enhanced through cooperative international projects. the signing of the moscow agreements for cooperation in space, environment, health, and science and technology has opened a new era in international relations. a similar agreement between the united states and polish governments will permit expansion of programs such as the jointly-funded copernicus astronomical center and the krakow children's hospital. finally, we pledge expanded efforts to aid unemployed scientists and engineers. we are determined to see that such on-going efforts as the technology mobilization and reemployment program are effective. the individual and government even though many urgently-needed administrative proposals have been long delayed or stopped by the opposition congress, we have kept our promise to make government more accountable and more responsive to the citizen. one such proposal is general revenue sharing with state and local governments - a means of returning to the people powers which for years have grown increasingly centralized in the remote washington bureaucracy. another is consolidation of scores of categorical grant programs into six special revenue sharing programs which would make available some $-billion annually in broad policy fields for states and localities to apply in their own ways to their own needs. yet another is our proposal to modernize the executive branch of the federal government by combining six cabinet departments and several independent agencies into four new departments. so far, the opposition controlled congress has blocked or ignored all of these proposals. in addition, we have: improved domestic policy formulation and implementation by the new domestic council and office of management and budget within the executive office of the president; established stronger liaison between the federal government and the states, counties and municipalities by a new office of intergovernmental relations, headed by the vice president; overhauled the fragmented and poorly coordinated federal agencies concerned with drug abuse and the environment; utilized voluntary citizen effort through the formation of the action agency in government and the national center for voluntary action outside of government proposed reorganization of the federal regulatory agencies and appointed distinguished people to those agencies; assured more open government, ending abuse of classification and providing fuller information to the public. we pledge continuing reform and revitalization of government to assure a better response to individual needs. we express deep concern for the flood victims of tropical storm agnes, the worst natural disaster in terms of property damage in our nation's history. past laws were totally inadequate to meet this crisis, and we commend the president's leadership in urgently recommending the newly-enacted $.-billion flood relief measure, greatly expanding and enlarging the present program. we pledge to reevaluate and enlarge the national flood disaster insurance program so that it will be adequate for future emergencies. we will continue to press for the enactment of general and special revenue sharing and to pursue further initiatives both to decentralize governmental activities and to transfer more such activities to the private sector. we will continue to defend the citizen's right to privacy in our increasingly interdependent society. we oppose computerized national data banks and all other ""big brother"" schemes which endanger individual rights. we reaffirm our view that voluntary prayer should be freely permitted in public places - particularly, by school children while attending public schools - provided that such prayers are not prepared or prescribed by the state or any of its political subdivisions and that no person's participation is coerced, thus preserving the traditional separation of church and state. we remain committed to a comprehensive program of human rights, social betterment and political participation for the people of the district of columbia. we will build on our strong record in this area - a record which includes cutting the district of columbia crime rate in half, aggressive support for a balanced transportation system in metropolitan washington, initiation of a bicentennial program and celebration in the national capital region, and support for the first congressional delegate in nearly a century. we support voting representation for the district of columbia in the united states congress and will work for a system of self-government for the city which takes fair account of the needs and interests of both the federal government and the citizens of the district of columbia. the republican party adheres to the principle of self-determination for puerto rico. we will welcome and support statehood for puerto rico if that status should be the free choice of its people in a referendum vote. additionally, we will pursue negotiations with the congress of micronesia on the future political status of the trust territories of the pacific islands to meet the mutual interests of both parties. we favor extending the right of electing the territorial governor to the people of american samoa, and will take complementary steps to increase local self-government in american samoa. we vigorously support such action as is necessary to permit american citizens resident in guam, puerto rico and the virgin islands to vote for president and vice president in national elections. we support full voting rights in committees for the delegates to congress from guam and the virgin islands. in our territorial policy we seek a maximum degree of local self-sufficiency and self-government, while encouraging greater inclusion in federal services and programs and greater participation in national decision-making. volunteerism. in our free system, the people are not only the source of our social problems but also the main source of solutions. volunteerism, therefore, an indispensable national resource, is basic to our republican philosophy. we applaud the administration's efforts to encourage volunteerism by all americans and commend the millions of volunteers who are working in communities and states across the country on myriad projects. we favor further implementation of voluntary action programs throughout the fifty states to assist public and private agencies in working to assure quality life for all human beings. arts and humanities. the united states is experiencing a cultural renaissance of inspiring dimension. scores of millions of our people are now supporting and participating in the arts and humanities in quest of a richer life of the mind and spirit. our national culture, no longer the preserve of the elite, is becoming a people's heritage of importance to the whole world. we believe, with the president, that ""the federal government has a vital role as catalyst, innovator, and supporter of public and private efforts for cultural development."" we have supported a three-year extension of the national foundation on the arts and the humanities, and increased the funding of its two endowments by more than four times the level of three years ago. the state arts councils, which operate in all states and the five special jurisdictions have also been strengthened. the arts endowment has raised its support for the nation's museums, orchestras, theatre, dance, opera companies and film centers and encouraged the creativity of individual artists and writers. in addition, the new federal expansion arts program has been sharply increased. we have encouraged federal agencies to use the arts in their programs sponsored an annual design assembly for federal administrators, requested the national endowment for the arts to recommend a program far upgrading the design of federal buildings and moved to set new standards of excellence in all design endeavors of the federal government. moreover, the national endowment for the humanities, now greatly enlarged, is fostering improved teaching and scholarship in history, literature, philosophy and ethics. the endowment also supports programs to raise levels of scholarship and teaching in afro-american, american indian and mexican-american studies, has broadened its fellowship programs to include junior college teachers, and stresses adult or continuing education, including educational television and film series. we have also expanded the funding of public broadcasting. for the future, we pledge continuance of our vigorous support of the arts and humanities. a better future for all children we believe, with the president, that the first five years of life are crucial to a child's development, and further, that every child should hare the opportunity to reach his full potential as an individual. we have, therefore, established the office of child development which has taken a comprehensive approach to the development of young children, combining programs dealing with their physical, social and educational needs and development. we have undertaken a wide variety of demonstration programs to assure our children, particularly poor children, a good start in life - for example, the parent and child center program for infant care, home start to strengthen the environment of the preschool child, and health start to explore new delivery systems of health care for young children. we have redirected head start to perform valuable full day child care and early education services, and more than , preschool children are now in the program. we have doubled funds for early childhood demonstration programs which win develop new tools and new teaching techniques to serve children who suffer from deafness, blindness and other handicaps. so that no child will be denied the opportunity for a productive life because of inability to read effectively, we have established the right to read program. to add impetus to the entire educational effort, our newly-created national institute of education ensures that broad research and experimentation will develop the best educational opportunities for all children. additionally, we have taken steps to help ensure that children receive proper care while their parents are at work. moreover, as stated elsewhere in this platform, we have broadened nutritional assistance to poor children by nearly tripling participation in the food stamp program, more than doubling the number of needy children in the school lunch program, operating a summer feeding program for three million young people, increasing the breakfast program fivefold, and doubling federal support for child nutritional programs. we are improving medical care for poor children through more vigorous treatment procedures under medicaid and more effectively targeting maternal and child health services to low-income mothers. we will continue to seek out new means to reach and teach children in their crucial early years. youth we believe that what our youth most want and need is not special treatment as a group apart, but just the opposite - the opportunity for full participation by exercising the rights and responsibilities of adults. in the president approved legislation which gave the vote to more than million -to- year olds. the 26th amendment, which places this important new right in the constitution, has our enthusiastic backing. our administration has already made the draft a far less arbitrary factor in young men's lives. now we near the point where we can end conscription altogether and achieve our goal of an all-volunteer armed force. our total war on drug abuse has had special benefits for youth, hardest hit by this menace. last year we held the first white house conference ever held by and for young people themselves. the administration gave the conference's more than recommendations a searching review, and last spring the president returned a detailed response and action report to the conferees. the anarchy which swept major campuses in the late 's penalized no one more severely than the young people themselves. the recent calm on campus is, we believe, in part the result of the president's leadership in winding down the war in vietnam, reducing the draft, and taking a strong stand against lawlessness, but our view is that colleges themselves are responsible for maintaining a campus climate that will preserve academic freedom. we have proposed legislation to ensure that no qualified student is denied a higher education by lack of funds, and have also moved to meet the often-overlooked concerns of the two-thirds of the college-age young not in school. we have developed a new job-oriented, career-education concept, expanded federal manpower programs, and provided record numbers of summer job opportunities for young men and women. to engage youthful idealism and energies more effectively, we have created the new action volunteer service agency bringing together the peace corps, vista, and other volunteer programs; and we encouraged the establishment of the independent national center for voluntary action. we stand for lowering the legal age of majority in all jurisdictions to ; and we will seek to broaden the involvement of young people in every phase of the political process - as voters, party workers and leaders, candidates and elected officials, and participants in government at municipal, state and federal levels. we will continue to build on these solid achievements in keeping with our conviction that these young people should have the opportunity to participate fully in the affairs of our society. equal rights for women the republican party recognizes the great contributions women have made to our society as homemakers and mothers, as contributors to the community through volunteer work, and as members of the labor force in careers outside the home. we fully endorse the principle of equal rights, equal opportunities, and equal responsibilities for women, and believe that progress in these areas is needed to achieve the full realization of the potentials of american women both in the home and outside the home. we reaffirm the president's pledge earlier this year: ""the administration will ... continue its strong efforts to open equal opportunities for women, recognizing clearly that women are often denied such opportunities today. while every woman may not want a career outside the home, every woman should have the freedom to choose whatever career she wishes - and an equal chance to pursue it. this administration has done more than any before it to help women of america achieve equality of opportunity. because of its efforts, more top-level and middle-management positions in the federal government are held by women than ever before. the president has appointed a woman as his special assistant in the white house, specifically charged with the recruitment of women for policy-making jobs in the united states government. women have also been named to high positions in the civil service commission and the department of labor to ensure equal opportunities for employment and advancement at all levels of the federal service. in addition we have: significantly increased resources devoted to enforcement of the fair labor standards act, providing equal pay for equal work. required all firms doing business with the government to have affirmative action plans for the hiring and promotion of women. requested congress to expand the jurisdiction of the commission on civil rights to cover sex discrimination. recommended and supported passage of title ix of the higher education act opposing discrimination against women in educational institutions. supported the equal employment opportunity act of giving the equal employment opportunity commission enforcement power in sex discrimination cases. continued our support of the equal rights amendment to the constitution, our party being the first national party to back this amendment. other factors beyond outright employer discrimination - the lack of child care facilities, for example - can limit job opportunities for women. for lower and middle income families, the president supported and signed into law a new tax provision which makes many child care expenses deductible for working parents. part of the president's recent welfare reform proposal would provide comprehensive day care services so that women on welfare can work. we believe the primary responsibility for a child's care and upbringing lies with the family. however, we recognize that for economic and many other reasons many parents require assistance in the care of their children. to help meet this need, we favor the development of publicly or privately run, voluntary, comprehensive, quality day care services, locally controlled but federally assisted, with the requirement that the recipients of these services will pay their fair share of the costs according to their ability. we oppose ill-considered proposals, incapable of being administered effectively, which would heavily engage the federal government in this area. to continue progress for women's rights, we will work toward: ratification of the equal rights amendment. appointment of women to highest level positions in the federal government, including the cabinet and the supreme court. equal pay for equal work. elimination of discrimination against women at all levels in federal government. elimination of discrimination against women in the criminal justice system, in sentencing, rehabilitation and prison facilities. increased opportunities for the part-time employment of women, and expanded training programs for women who want to re-enter the labor force. elimination of economic discrimination against women in credit, mortgage, insurance, property, rental and finance contracts. we pledge vigorous enforcement of all federal statutes and executive orders barring job discrimination on the basis of sex. we are proud of the contributions made by women to better government. we regard the active involvement of women on all levels of the political process, from precinct to national status, as of great importance to our country. the republican party welcomes and encourages their maximum participation. older americans we believe our nation must develop a new awareness of the attitudes and needs of our older citizens. elderly americans are far too often the forgotten americans, relegated to lives of idleness and isolation by a society bemused with the concerns of other groups. we are distressed by the tendency of many americans to ignore the heartbreak and hardship resulting from the generation gap which separates so many of our people from those who have reached the age of retirement. we deplore what is tantamount to cruel discrimination - age discrimination in employment, and the discrimination of neglect and indifference perhaps the cruelest of all. we commit ourselves to helping older americans achieve greater self-reliance and greater opportunities for direct participation in the activities of our society. we believe that the later years should be, not isolated years, not years of dependency, but years of fulfillment and dignity. we believe our older people are not to be regarded as a burden but rather should be valuable participants in our society. we believe their judgment, their experience, and their talents are immensely valuable to our country. because we so believe, we are seeking and have sought in many ways to help older americans - for example: federal programs of direct benefit to older americans have increased more than $ billion these past four years. as part of this, social security benefits are more than percent higher than they were four years ago, the largest increase in the history of social security. social security benefits have become inflation proof by making them rise automatically to match cost of living increases, a protection long advocated by the republican party. we have upgraded nursing homes. expenditures under the older americans act have gone up percent since president nixon took office, with a strong emphasis on programs enabling older americans to live dignified, independent lives in their own homes. the valuable counsel of older people has been sought directly through the white house conference on aging. the president has appointed high level advisers on the problems of the aging to his personal staff. we have urged upon the opposition congress - again, typically, to no avail - numerous additional programs of benefit to the elderly. we will continue pressing for these new initiatives to: increase the amount of money a person can earn without losing social security benefits. increase widow, widower, and delayed retirement benefits. improve the effectiveness of medicare, including elimination, of the monthly premium required under part b of medicare - the equivalent of more than a three percent social security increase. strengthen private pension plans through tax deductions to encourage their expansion, improved vesting, and protection of the investments in these funds. reform our tax system so that persons or over will receive increased tax-free income. encourage volunteer service activities for older americans such as the retired senior volunteer program and the foster grandparents program. give special attention to bringing full government services within the reach of the elderly to rural areas who are often unable to share fully in their deserved benefits because of geographic inaccessibility. upgrade other federal activities important to the elder including programs for nutrition, housing and nursing homes, transportation, consumer protection, and elimination of age discrimination in government and private employment. we encourage constructive efforts which will help older citizens to be better informed about existing programs and services designed to meet their needs, and we pledge to cut away excessive federal red tape to make it easier for older americans to receive the benefits to which they are entitled. working men and women the skill, industry and productivity of american workers are the driving force of our free economy. the nation's labor unions, comprised of millions of working people, have advanced the well-being not only of their members but also of our entire free enterprise system. we of the republican party reaffirm our strong endorsement of organized labor's key role in our national life. we salute the statesmanship of the labor union movement. time and time again, at crucial moments, it has voiced its out-spoken support for a firm and effective foreign policy and for keeping the armed forces of the united states modern and strong. the american labor movement and the republican party have always worked against the spread of totalitarian forms of government. together we can continue to preserve in america the best system of government ever devised for human happiness and fulfillment. we are for the right of american workers and their families to enjoy and to retain to the greatest possible extent the rewards of their own labor. we regard collective bargaining as the cornerstone of the nation's labor relations policy. the government's role is not to encroach upon this process but rather to aid the differing parties to make collective bargaining more effective both for themselves and for the public. in furtherance of that concept we will continue to develop procedures whereby the imagination, ingenuity and knowledge of labor and management can more effectively seek solutions for such problems as structural adjustment and productivity. in the construction industry, for example, we will build on a new joint effort between government and all parts of the industry to solve such problems as seasonality and varying peaks of demand to ensure a stable growth in the number of skilled craftsmen . we call upon management and labor to devote their best efforts to finding better ways to conduct labor-management relations so the good of all the people can be advanced without strikes or lockouts. we will continue to search for realistic and fair solutions to emergency labor disputes, guided by two basic principles: first, that the health and safety of the people of the united states should always be paramount; and second, that collective bargaining should be kept as free as possible from government interference. for mine health and safety, we have implemented the most comprehensive legislation in the nation's history, resulting in a major reduction in mine-related accidents. we pledge continued advancement of the health and safety of workers. we will continue to press for improved pension vesting and other statutory protections to assure that americans will not lose their hard-earned retirement incomes. we pledge further modernization of the federal civil service systems including emphasis on executive development. we dedicate ourselves to promotion on merit, equal opportunity, and the setting of clear incentives for higher productivity. we give continuing close attention to the evolving labor-management relationship in the federal service. we pledge realistic programs of education and training so that all americans able to do so can make their own way, on their own ability, receiving an equal and fair chance to advance themselves. we flatly oppose the notion that the hard-earned tax dollars of american workers should be used to support those who can work but choose not to, and who believe that the world owes them a living free from any responsibility or care. we are proud of our many other solid achievements on behalf of america's working people - for example: nearly five million additional workers brought under the coverage of the unemployment insurance system, and eligibility deadlines twice extended. funding for more than , jobs under the emergency employment act. expansion of vocational education and manpower training programs. use of the long-neglected trade expansion act to help workers who lose their jobs because of imports. we strongly favor vigorous competition by american business in the world market but in ways that do not displace american jobs. negotiation of long-needed limitations on imports of manmade fibers, textiles and other products, thus protecting american jobs. we share the desire of all americans for continued prosperity in peacetime. we will work closely with labor and management toward our mutual goal of assuring a job for every man and woman seeking the dignity of work. ending discrimination from its beginning, our party has led the way for equal rights and equal opportunity. this great tradition has been carried forward by the nixon administration. through our efforts de jure segregation is virtually ended. we pledge continuation of these efforts until no american schoolchild suffers educational deprivation because of the color of his skin or the language he speaks and all schoolchildren are receiving high quality education. in pursuit of this goal. we have proposed $.-billion of federal aid to school districts to improve educational opportunities and build facilities for disadvantaged children. further to assure minority progress, we have provided more support to predominantly black colleges than ever before - twice the amount being spent when president nixon took office. additionally, we have strengthened federal enforcement of equal opportunity laws. spending for civil rights enforcement has been increased from $-million to $-million - concrete evidence of our commitment to equal justice for all. the president also supported and signed into law the equal employment opportunity act of , which makes the equal employment opportunity commission a much more powerful body. working closely with leaders of construction unions, we have initiated ""hometown"" plans which call for more than , additional minority hirings in the building trades during the next four years. we will continue to search out new employment opportunities for minorities in other fields as well. we believe such new jobs can and should be created without displacing those already at work. we will give special consideration to minority americans who live and make their way in the rural regions of our country - americans too often bypassed m the advances of the general society. we have made unprecedented progress in strengthening minority participation in american business. we created the office of minority business enterprise in march, , to coordinate the federal programs assisting members of minority groups who seek to establish or expand businesses. we have more than tripled federal loans, guarantees and grants to minority-owned businesses. more minority americans are now in our nation's economic mainstream than at any other time in our history, and we pledge every effort to expand these gains. minority businesses now receive percent of the small business administration dollar - more than double the proportion in . many minority enterprise small business investment companies have been licensed since to provide venture capital for minority enterprises. more than $-million is now available through this program, and we have requested additional funding. in late , we initiated a combined government-private program to increase minority bank deposits. this year our goal of $-million has been reached four times over. we pledge to carry forward our efforts to place minority citizens in responsible positions - efforts we feel are already well under way. during the last four years the percentage of minority federal employees has risen to a record high of almost percent and, perhaps more important, the quality of jobs for minority americans has improved. we have recruited more minority citizens for top managerial posts in civil service than ever before. we will see that our progress in this area will continue and grow. in president nixon approved strong new amendments to the voting rights act of , and we pledge continued vigilance to ensure that the rights affirmed by this act are upheld. the cultural diversity of america's heritage groups have always been a source of strength for our society and our party. we reaffirm our commitment to the basic american values which have made this nation the land of opportunity for these groups, originating from all sectors of the world, from asia to africa to europe to latin america. we will continue our party's open door policy and work to assure all minorities full opportunity for participation in the political process. we pledge vigorous support of the bilingual act and the ethnic studies heritage act. spanish-speaking americans in recognition of the significant contributions to our country by our proud and independent spanish-speaking citizens, we have developed a comprehensive program to help achieve equal opportunity. during the last four years spanish-speaking americans have achieved a greater role in national affairs. more than thirty have been appointed to high federal positions. to provide the same learning opportunities enjoyed by other american children, we have increased bilingual education programs almost sixfold since . we initiated a -point employment program to help spanish-speaking workers, created the national economic development association to promote spanish-speaking business development and expanded economic development opportunities in spanish-speaking communities. we will work for the use of bilingual staff in localities where this language capability is desirable for effective health care. indians, alaska natives and hawaiians president nixon has evolved a totally new indian policy which we fully support. the opposition congress, by inaction on most of the president's proposals, has thwarted indian rights and opportunities. we commend the department of interior for its stalwart defense of indian land and water rights, and we urge the congress to join in support of that effort. we further request congress to permit indian tribal governments to assume control over the programs of the departments of interior and health. education and welfare in their homelands, to assure indians a role in determining how funds can best be used for their children's schools, to expand indian economic development opportunity, to triple the funds for indian credit and create a new assistant secretary of the interior and territorial affairs. these reforms, all urged by the president, have been ignored by the congress. we - with the indian people - are impatiently waiting. knowing the indians' love for their land and recognizing the many wrongs committed in years past, the president has restored blue lake in new mexico to the taos pueblo and the mt. adams area in washington to the yakima nation. we are seeking to protect indian water rights in pyramid bringing suit in the supreme court. we are fully aware of the severe problems facing the menominee indians in seeking to have federal recognition restored to their tribe and promise a complete and sympathetic examination of their pleas. we have increased the bureau of indian affairs' budget by percent, nearly doubled funds for indian health, and are arranging with tribal leaders for the allocation of bureau funds in accordance with priorities set by the tribal governments themselves. we pledge continued attention to the needs of off-reservation indians and have launched demonstration projects at indian centers in nine major cities. we are determined that the first americans will not be the forgotten americans, and that their rights will be respected. at the president's recommendation, the congress voted an alaska native claims settlement which confirms the titles of the eskimos, indians and aleuts to million acres and compensates them with a generous cash settlement. we will also preserve and continue to protect the hawaiian homes commission act which provides land already set aside for hawaiians for homes and the opportunity to preserve their culture. our achievements for human dignity and opportunity are specific and real, not idle promises. they have brought tremendous progress to many thousands of minority citizens and made our society more just for all. we will press on with our fight against social injustice and discrimination, building upon the achievements already made. knowing that none of us can reap the fullest blessings of liberty until all of us can, we reaffirm our commitment to the upward struggle for universal freedom led by abraham lincoln a century ago. amendment adopted we will continue the policies of indian preference in hiring and promotion and apply it to all levels, including management and supervisory positions in those agencies with programs affecting indian peoples. the standard of living of indian americans is still far below that of any of the peoples of the united states this intolerable level of existence should be alleviated by enactment of new legislation designed to further indian self-determination without termination and to close this economic gap and raise the indian standard of life to that of the rest of america. we favor the development of such legislation in the 93rd congress. consumers the american consumer has a right to product safety clearly specified qualities and values, honest descriptions and guarantees, fair credit procedures, and due recourse for fraud and deception. we are addressing these concerns forcefully with executive action and legislative and legal initiatives. the issues involved in this accelerating awareness on the part of consumers lie close to the heart of the dynamic american market: good products at fair prices made it great; the same things will keep it great. enlightened business management is as interested in consumer protection and consumer education as are consumers themselves. in a market place as competitive and diverse as ours, a company's future depends on the reputation of its products. one safety error can wipe out an established firm overnight. unavoidably, the remoteness of business management from the retail counter tends to hamper consumers in resolving quality and performance questions. technical innovations make it harder for the consumer to evaluate new products. legal complexities often deny efficient remedies for deception or product failure. to assist consumers and business, president nixon established the first office of consumer affairs in the white house and made its director a member of his personal staff and of the cost of living council. we have also proposed a buyer's bill of rights, including: federal authority for the regulation of hazardous consumer products; requirement of full disclosure of the terms of warranties and guarantees in language all can understand. we support the establishment of an independent consumer protection agency to present the consumer's case in proceedings before federal agencies and also a consumer product safety agency in the department of health, education and welfare. we oppose punitive proposals which are more anti-business than pro-consumer. we pledge vigorous enforcement of all consumer protection laws and to foster more consumer education as a vital necessity in a marketplace ever increasing in variety and complexity. veterans we regard our nation's veterans precisely as our president does: ""americans have long known that those who defended the great values of our nation in wartime are of great value to the nation when the war is over. it is traditional that the american veteran has been helped by his nation so that he can create his own 'peace story,' a story of prosperity, independence and dignity. ""veterans benefit programs have therefore become more than a recognition for services performed in the past; they have become an investment in the future of the veteran and of his country."" under republican leadership, far more for our veterans is being done than ever before: g.i. bill education benefits have been increased more than percent. vietnam-era veterans have the highest assistance levels in history to help them pursue educational opportunities. major cost of living adjustments have been made in compensation and pension payments. medical services are the best in the history of the veterans administration and now include a strong new drug treatment and rehabilitation program. disability benefits have been increased. gi home loan benefits have been expanded and improved. the total administration commitment is massive - $. billion for this fiscal year. this is the largest veterans administration budget in history, and the third largest of all federal agencies and departments. we are giving the highest priority to the employment problems of vietnam veterans. in we initiated a comprehensive program which recently placed more than one million vietnam-era veterans in jobs, training and education programs. for the future, we pledge: continuation of the veterans administration as a strong, independent agency; continuation of an independent system of veterans administration health care facilities to provide america's veterans with the best medical care available, including appropriate attention to the problems of the ex-serviceman afflicted with drug and alcohol problems; continuing attention to the needs of the vietnam-era veteran, with special emphasis on employment opportunities, education and housing; continuation of our efforts to raise gi bill education benefits to a level commensurate with post-world war ii benefits in adjusted dollars. continued effort for a better coordinated national policy on cemeteries and burial benefits for veterans. we will not fail our obligation to the nation's million veterans and will stand ever watchful of their needs and rights. conclusion the record is clear. more than any president, richard nixon has achieved major changes in policy and direction in our government. he has restored faith - faith that our system will indeed reflect the will of the people - faith that there will be a new era of peace and human progress at home and around the world. to be sure, there is unfinished business on the agenda of our ever-restless nation. we have great concern for those who have not participated more fully in the general prosperity. the twin evils of crime and drug abuse are still to be conquered. peace in the world is not yet won. but republican leadership has restored stability and sanity to our land once again. we have vigorously attacked every major problem. once again our direction is peace; once again our determination is national strength; once again we are prospering; once again, on a host of fronts, we are making progress. now we look to tomorrow. we pledge ourselves to go forward at an accelerated pace - with a determination and zeal unmatched before. in four years we mark the 200th anniversary of the freest, most productive, most benevolent nation of all human history. in four years we celebrate one of man's highest achievements - two hundred years as a constitutional republic founded on the noble concept that every person is a sovereign being, possessed of dignity and inalienable rights. almost two centuries ago, the founding fathers envisioned a nation of tree people. at peace with themselves and the world - each with equal opportunity to pursue happiness his own way. much of that dream has come true; much is still to be fulfilled. we, the republican party, pledge ourselves to go forward, hand-in-hand with every citizen, to solve those problems that yet stand in the way of realizing that more perfect union, the dream of the founding fathers - a dream enhanced by the free and generous gift of people working together, not in shifting alliances of separated minorities, but in unison of spirit and purpose. we cannot favor, nor can we respect, the notion of group isolation in our united states of america. we must not divide and weaken ourselves by attitudes or policies which would segregate our citizens into separate racial, ethnic, economic, religious or social groups. it is the striving of all of us - our striving together as americans - that will move our nation continually onward to our founders' dream. building on the foundations of peace in the world, and reason and prosperity at home, our republican party pledges a new era of progress for man - progress toward more freedom, toward greater protection of individual rights, toward more security from want and fear, toward greater fulfillment and happiness for all. we pledge to the american people that the 200th anniversary of this nation will be more than a celebration of two centuries of unequaled success; we pledge it also to be the beginning of the third and greatest century for all of our countrymen and, we pray, for all people in the world.","['preamble', 'year', 'republican', 'party', 'greater', 'reason', 'ever', 'pride', 'stewardship', 'accomplishments', 'weighed', 'opponents', 'philosophy', 'programs', 'candidates', 'assessed',

Democratic Party,1976,1970,dem_1976.csv,CSV,"PREAMBLE We meet to adopt a Democratic platform, and to nominate Democratic candidates for President and Vice President of the United States, almost 200 years from the day that our revolutionary founders declared this country's independence from the British crown. The founder of the Democratic Party, Thomas Jefferson of Virginia - set forth the reasons for this separation and expressed the basic tenets of democratic government: That all persons are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness - That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among People, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. These truths may still be self-evident, but they have been tragically abused by our national government during the past eight years. Two Republican Administrations have both misused and mismanaged the powers of national government, obstructing the pursuit of economic and social opportunity, causing needless hardship and despair among millions of our fellow citizens. Two Republican Administrations have betrayed the people's trust and have created suspicion and distrust of government through illegal and unconstitutional actions. We acknowledge that no political party, nor any President or Vice President, possesses answers to all of the problems that face us as a nation, but neither do we concede that every human problem is beyond our control. We recognize further that the present distrust of government cannot be transformed easily into confidence. It is within our power to recapture, in this governing of this nation, the basic tenets of fairness, equality, opportunity and rule of law that motivated our revolutionary founders. We do pledge a government that has as its guiding concern, the needs and aspirations of all the people, rather than the perquisites and special privilege of the few. We do pledge a government that is not afraid to admit its mistakes. We do pledge a government that will be committed to a fairer distribution of wealth, income and power. We do pledge a government in which the new Democratic President will work closely with the leaders of the Congress on a regular, systematic basis so that the people can see the results of unity. We do pledge a government in which the Democratic members in both houses of Congress will seek a unity of purpose on the principles of the party. Now, as we enter our 200th year as a nation, we as a party, with a sense of our own limitations, but also with a sense of our obligations, pledge a reaffirmation of this nation's founding principles. In this platform of the Democratic Party, we present a clear alternative to the failures of preceding administrations and a projection of the common future to which we aspire: a world at peace; a just society of equals; a society without violence; a society in consonance with its natural environment, affording freedom to the individual and the opportunity to develop to the fullest human potential. I. Full Employment, Price Stability and Balanced Growth The Democratic Party's concern for human dignity and freedom has been directed at increasing the economic opportunities for all our citizens and reducing the economic deprivation and inequities that have stained the record of American democracy. Today, millions of people are unemployed. Unemployment represents mental anxiety, fear of harassment over unpaid bills, idle hours, loss of self-esteem, strained family relationships, deprivation of children and youth, alcoholism, drug abuse and crime. A job is a key measure of a person's place in society - whether as a full-fledged participant or on the outside. Jobs are the solution to poverty, hunger and other basic needs of workers and their families. Jobs enable a person to translate legal rights of equality into reality. Our industrial capacity is also wastefully underutilized. There are houses to build, urban centers to rebuild, roads and railroads to construct and repair, rivers to clean, and new sources of energy to develop. Something is wrong when there is work to be done, and the people who are willing to do it are without jobs. What we have lacked is leadership. Republican Mismanagement During the past 25 years, the American economy has suffered five major recessions, all under Republican administrations. During the past eight years, we have had two costly recessions with continuing unprecedented peacetime inflation. ""Stagflation"" has become a new word in our language just as it has become a product of Republican economic policy. Never before have we had soaring inflation in the midst of a major recession. Stagnation, waste and human suffering are the legacy left to the American people by Republican economic policies. During the past five years, U.S. economic growth has averaged only 1 1/2 per cent per year compared with an historical average of about 4 per cent. Because of this shortfall, the nation has lost some $500-billion in the production of goods and services, and, if Republican rule continues, we can expect to lose another $600-$800-billion by 1980. Ten million people are unemployed right now, and twenty to thirty million were jobless at some time in each of the last two years. For major groups in the labor force - minorities, women, youth, older workers, farm, factory and construction workers - unemployment has been, and remains, at depression levels. The rising cost of food, clothing, housing, energy and health care has eroded the income of the average American family, and has pushed persons on fixed incomes to the brink of economic disaster. Since 1970, the annual rate of inflation has averaged more than 6 per cent and is projected by the Ford administration to continue at an unprecedented peacetime rate of 6 to 7 per cent until 1978. The depressed production and high unemployment rates of the Nixon-Ford administrations have produced federal deficits totalling $242-billion. Those who should be working and paying taxes are collecting unemployment compensation or other welfare payments in order to survive. For every one per cent increase in the unemployment rate - for every one million Americans out of work - we all pay $3-billion more in unemployment compensation and $2-billion in welfare and related costs, and lose $14-billion in taxes. In fiscal 1976, $76-billion was lost to the federal government through increased recession-related expenditures and lost revenues. In addition, state and local governments lost $27-billion in revenues. A return to full employment will eliminate such deficits. With prudent management of existing programs, full employment revenues will permit the financing of national Democratic initiatives. For millions of Americans, the Republican Party has substituted welfare for work. Huge sums will be spent on food stamps and medical care for families of the unemployed. Social insurance costs are greatly increased. This year alone the federal government will spend nearly $20-billion on unemployment compensation. In contrast, spending on job development is only $2 1/2-billion. The goal of the new Democratic administration will be to turn unemployment checks into pay checks. What Democrats Can Achieve In contrast to the record of Republican mismanagement, the most recent eight years of Democratic leadership, under John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, produced economic growth that was virtually uninterrupted. The unemployment rate dropped from 6.7 per cent in 1961 to 3.6 per cent in 1968, and most segments of the population benefited. Inflation increased at an average annual rate of only 2 per cent, and the purchasing power of the average family steadily increased. In 1960, about 40 million people were living in poverty. Over the next eight years, 14 1/2 million people moved out of poverty because of training opportunities, increased jobs and higher incomes. Since 1968, the number of persons living in poverty has remained virtually unchanged. We have met the goals of full employment with stable prices in the past and can do it again. The Democratic Party is committed to the right of all adult Americans willing, able and seeking work to have opportunities for useful jobs at living wages. To make that commitment meaningful, we pledge ourselves to the support of legislation that will make every responsible effort to reduce adult unemployment to 3 per cent within 4 years. Modernizing Economic Policy To meet our goals we must set annual targets for employment, production and price stability; the Federal Reserve must be made a full partner in national economic decisions and become responsive to the economic goals of Congress and the President, credit must be generally available at reasonable interest rates; tax, spending and credit policies must be carefully coordinated with our economic goals, and coordinated within the framework of national economic planning. Of special importance is the need for national economic planning capability. This planning capability should provide roles for Congress and the Executive as equal partners in the process and provide for full participation by the private sector, and state and local government. Government must plan ahead just like any business, and this type of planning can be implemented without the creation of a new bureaucracy but rather through the well defined use of existing bodies and techniques. If we do not plan, but continue to react to crisis after crisis, our economic performance will be further eroded. Full Employment Policies Institutional reforms and the use of conventional tax, spending and credit policies must be accompanied by a broad range of carefully-targeted employment programs that will reduce unemployment in the private sector, and in regions, states and groups that have special employment problems. The lack of formal coordination among federal, state and local governments is a major obstacle to full employment. The absence of economic policy coordination is particularly visible during times of high unemployment. Recessions reduce tax revenues, and increase unemployment-related expenditures for state and local governments. To maintain balanced budgets or reduce budget deficits these governments are forced to increase taxes and cut services-actions that directly undermine federal efforts to stimulate the economy. Consistent and coherent economic policy requires federal anti-recession grant programs to state and local government, accompanied by public employment, public works projects and direct stimulus to the private sector. In each case, the programs should be phased in automatically when unemployment rises and phased out as it declines. Even during periods of normal economic growth there are communities and regions of the country - particularly central cities and rural areas - that do not fully participate in national economic prosperity. The Democratic Party has supported national economic policies which have consciously sought to aid regions in the nation which have been afflicted with poverty, or newer regions which have needed resources for development. These policies were soundly conceived and have been successful. Today, we have different areas and regions in economic decline and once again face a problem of balanced economic growth. To restore balance, national economic policy should be designed to target federal resources in areas of greatest need. To make low interest loans to businesses and state and local governments for the purpose of encouraging private sector investment in chronically depressed areas, we endorse consideration of programs such as a domestic development bank or federally insured taxable state and local bonds with adequate funding, proper management and public disclosure. Special problems faced by young people, especially minorities, entering the labor force persist regardless of the state of the economy. To meet the needs of youth, we should consolidate existing youth employment programs; improve training, apprenticeship, internship and job-counseling programs at the high school and college levels; and permit youth participation in public employment projects. There are people who will be especially difficult to employ. Special means for training and locating jobs for these people in the private sector, and, to the extent required, in public employment, should be established. Every effort should be made to create jobs in the private sector. Clearly, useful public jobs are far superior to welfare and unemployment payments. The federal government has the responsibility to ensure that all Americans able, willing and seeking work are provided opportunities for useful jobs. Equal Employment Opportunity We must be absolutely certain that no person is excluded from the fullest opportunity for economic and social participation in our society on the basis of sex, age, color religion or national origin. Minority unemployment has historically been at least double the aggregate unemployment rate, with incomes at two-thirds the national average. Special emphasis must be placed on closing this gap. Accordingly, we reaffirm this Party's commitment to full and vigorous enforcement of all equal opportunities laws and affirmative action. The principal agencies charged with anti-discrimination enforcement in jobs - the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Labor, and the Justice Department - are locked into such overlapping and uncoordinated strategies that a greatly improved government-wide system for the delivery of equal job and promotion opportunities must be developed and adequate funding committed to that end. New remedies to provide equal opportunities need exploration. Anti-Inflation Policies The economic and social costs of inflation have been enormous. Inflation is a tax that erodes the income of our workers, distorts business investment decisions, and redistributes income in favor of the rich Americans on fixed incomes, such as the elderly, are often pushed into poverty by this cruel tax. The Ford administration and its economic advisors have been consistently wrong about the sources and cures of the inflation that has plagued our nation and our people. Fighting inflation by curtailing production and increasing unemployment has done nothing to restrain it. With the current high level of unemployment and low level of capacity utilization, we can increase production and employment without rekindling inflation. A comprehensive anti-inflation policy; must be established to assure relative price stability. Such a program should emphasize increased production and productivity and should take other measures to enhance the stability and flexibility of our economy. The see-saw progress of our economy over the past eight years has disrupted economic growth. Much of the instability has been created by stop-and-go monetary policies. High interest rates and the recurring underutilization of our manufacturing plant and equipment have retarded new investment. The high cost of credit has stifled small business and virtually halted the housing industry. Unemployment in the construction industry has been raised to depression levels and home ownership has been priced beyond the reach of the majority of our people. Stable economic growth with moderate interest rates will not only place downward pressure on prices through greater efficiency and productivity, but will reduce the prospects for future shortages of supply by increasing the production of essential goods and services and by providing a more predictable environment for business investment. The government must also work to improve the ability of our economy to respond to change Competition in the private sector a reexamination, reform and consolidation of the existing regulatory structure. and promotion of a freer but fair system of international trade will aid in achieving that goal. At times. direct government involvement in wage and price decisions may be required to ensure price stability. But we do not believe that such involvement requires a comprehensive system of mandatory controls at this time. It will require that business and labor must meet fair standards of wage and price change. A strong domestic council on price and wage stability should he established with particular attention to restraining price increases in those sectors of our economy where prices are ""administered"" and where price competition does not exist. The federal government should hold public hearings. investigate and publish facts an price, profit, wage and interest rate increases that seriously threaten national price stability. Such investigations and proper planning can focus public opinion and awareness on the direction of price, profit, wage and interest rate decisions. Finally, tax policy should be used if necessary to maintain the real income of workers as was done with the 1975 tax cut. Economic Justice The Democratic Party has a long history of opposition to the undue concentration of wealth and economic power. It is estimated that about three-quarters of the country's total wealth is owned by one-fifth of the people. The rest of our population struggles to make ends meet in the face of rising prices and taxes. Anti-Trust Enforcement The next Democratic administration will commit itself to move vigorously against anti-competitive concentration of power within the business sector. This can he accomplished in part by strengthening the anti-trust laws and insuring adequate commitment and resources for the enforcement of these laws. But we must go beyond this negative remedy to a positive policy for encouraging the development of small business including the family farm. Small Businesses A healthy and growing small business community is a prerequisite for increasing competition and a thriving national economy While most people would accept this view, the federal government has in the past impeded the growth of small business. To alleviate the unfavorable conditions for small business, we must make every effort to assure the availability of loans to small business, including direct government loans at reasonable interest rates, particularly to those in greatest need, such as minority-owned businesses. For example, efforts should be made to strengthen minority business programs, and increase minority opportunities for business ownership. We support similar programs and opportunities for women. Federal contract and procurement opportunities in such areas as housing, transportation and energy should support efforts to increase the volume of minority and small business involvement. Regulatory agencies and the regulated small business must work together to see that federal regulations are met, without applying a stranglehold on the small firm or farm and with less paperwork and red tape. Tax Reform Economic justice will also require a firm commitment to tax reform at all levels. In recent years there has been a shift in the tax burden from the rich to the working people of this country. The Internal Revenue Code offers massive tax welfare to the wealthiest income groups in the population and only higher taxes for the average citizen. In 1973, there were 622 people with adjusted income of $100.000 or more who still managed to pay no tax. Most families pay between 20 and 25 per cent of their incomes in taxes. We have had endless talk about the need for tax reform and fairness in our federal tax system. It is now time for action. We pledge the Democratic Party to a complete overhaul of the present tax system, which will review all special tax provisions to ensure that they are justified and distributed equitably among our citizens. A responsible Democratic tax reform program could save over $5-billion in the first year with larger savings in the future. We will strengthen the internal revenue tax code so that high income citizens pay a reasonable tax on all economic income. We will reduce the use of unjustified tax shelters in such areas as oil and gas, taxloss farming, real estate, and movies. We will eliminate unnecessary and ineffective tax provisions to business and substituting effective incentives to encourage small business and capital formation in all businesses. Our commitment to full employment and sustained purchasing power will also provide a strong incentive for capital formation. We will end abuses in the tax treatment of income from foreign sources; such as special tax treatment and incentives for multinational corporations that drain jobs and capital from the American economy. We will overhaul federal estate and gift taxes to provide an effective and equitable structure to promote tax justice and alleviate some of the legitimate problems faced by farmers, small business men and women and others who would otherwise be forced to liquidate assets in order to pay the tax. We will seek and eliminate provisions that encourage uneconomic corporate mergers and acquisitions. We will eliminate tax inequities that adversely affect individuals on the basis of sex or marital status. We will curb expense account deductions. And we will protect the rights of all taxpayers against oppressive procedures harassment and invasions of privacy by the Internal Revenue Service. At present, many federal government tax and expenditure programs have a profound but unintended and undesirable impact on jobs and on where people and business locate. Tax policies and other indirect subsidies have promoted deterioration of cities and regions. These policies should be reversed. There are other areas of taxation where change is also needed. The Ford administration's unwise and unfair proposal to raise the regressive social security tax gives new urgency to the Democratic Party's goal of redistributing the burden of the social security tax by raising the wage base for earnings subject to the tax with effective exemptions and deductions to ease the impact on low income workers and two-earner families. Further revision in the Social Security program will be required so that women are treated as individuals. The Democratic Party should make a reappraisal of the appropriate sources of federal revenues. The historical distribution of the tax burden between corporations and individuals, and among the various types of federal taxes, has changed dramatically in recent years. For example, the corporate tax share of federal revenue has declined from 30 per cent in 1954 to 14 per cent in 1975. Labor Standards and Rights The purpose of fair labor standards legislation has been the maintenance of the minimum standards necessary for the health, efficiency and general well-being of workers. Recent inflation has eroded the real value of the current minimum wage. This rapid devaluation of basic income for working people makes a periodic review of the level of the minimum wage essential. Such a review should insure that the minimum wage rate at least keep pace with the increase in the cost of living. Raising the pay standard for overtime work, additional hiring of part-time persons and flexible work schedules will increase the independence of workers and create additional job opportunities, especially for women. We also support the principle of equal pay for comparable work. We are committed to full implementation and enforcement of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Over a generation ago this nation established a labor policy whose purpose is to encourage the practice and procedure of collective bargaining and the right of workers to organize to obtain this goal. The Democratic Party is committed to extending the benefit of the policy to all workers and to removing the barriers to its administration. We support the right of public employees and agricultural workers to organize and bargain collectively. We urge the adoption of appropriate federal legislation to ensure this goal. We will seek to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to speed up redress of grievances of workers asserting their legal rights. We will seek to enforce and, where necessary, to amend the National Labor Relations Act to eliminate delays and inequities and to provide for more effective remedies and administration. We will support the full right of construction workers to picket a job site peacefully. We will seek repeal of Section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act which allows states to legislate the anti-union open shop. We will maintain strong support for the process of voluntary arbitration, and we will enact minimum federal standards for workers compensation laws and for eligibility, benefit amounts, benefit duration and other essential features of the unemployment insurance program. Unemployment insurance should cover all wage and salary workers. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 should cover all employees and be enforced as intended when the law was enacted. Early and periodic review of its provisions should be made to insure that they are reasonable and workable. The Democratic Party will also seek to enact a comprehensive mine safety law, utilizing the most effective and independent enforcement by the federal government and support special legislation providing adequate compensation to coal miners and their dependents who have suffered disablement or death as a result of the black lung disease. We believe these policies will put America back to work, bring balanced growth to our economy and give all Americans an opportunity to share in the expanding prosperity that will come from a new Democratic administration. II. Government Reform and Business Accountability The current Republican administration did not invent inept government, but it has saddled the country with ineffective government; captive government, subservient to the special pleading of private economic interests; insensitive government, trampling over the rights of average citizens; and remote government, secretive and unresponsive. Democrats believe that the cure for these ills is not the abandonment of governmental responsibility for addressing national problems, but the restoration of legitimate popular control over the organs and activities of government. There must be an ever-increasing accountability of government to the people. The Democratic Party is pledged to the fulfillment of four fundamental citizen rights of governance: the right to competent government; the right to responsive government; the right to integrity in government; the right to fair dealing by government . The Right to Competent Government The Democratic Party is committed to the adoption of reforms such as zero-based budgeting, mandatory reorganization timetables, and sunset laws which do not jeopardize the implementation of basic human and political rights. These reforms are designed to terminate or merge existing agencies and programs, or to renew them only after assuring elimination of duplication, overlap, and conflicting programs and authorities, and the matching of funding levels to public needs. In addition, we seek flexibility to reflect changing public needs, the use of alternatives to regulation and the elimination of special interest favoritism and bias. To assure that government remains responsive to the people's elected representatives, the Democratic Party supports stepped-up congressional agency oversight and program evaluation, including full implementation of the congressional budget process; an expanded. more forceful role for the General Accounting Office in performing legislative audits for Congress; and restraint by the President in exercising executive privilege designed to withhold necessary information from Congress. The Right to Responsive Government To begin to restore the shaken faith of Americans that the government in Washington is their government - responsive to their needs and desires, not the special interests of wealth, entrenched political influence, or bureaucratic self-interest - government decision-making must be opened up to citizen advocacy and participation. Governmental decision-making behind closed doors is the natural enemy of the people. The Democratic Party is committed to openness throughout government: at regulatory commissions, advisory committee meetings and at hearings. Public calendars of scheduled meetings between regulators and the regulated, and freedom of information policies, should be designed to facilitate rather than frustrate citizen access to documents and information. All persons and citizen groups must be given standing to challenge illegal or unconstitutional government action in court and to compel appropriate action. Where a court or an agency finds evidence of government malfeasance or neglect those who brought forward such evidence should be compensated for their reasonable expenses in doing so. Democrats have long sought - against fierce Republican and big business opposition - the creation and maintenance of an independent consumer agency with the staff and power to intervene in regulatory matters on behalf of the consuming and using public. Many states have already demonstrated that such independent public or consumer advocates can win important victories for the public interest in proceedings before state regulatory agencies and courts. This nation's Civil Service numbers countless strong and effective public servants. It was the resistance of earnest and steadfast federal workers that stemmed the Nixon-Ford efforts to undermine the integrity of the Civil Service. The reorganization of government which we envision will protect the job rights of civil servants and permit them to more effectively serve the public. The Democratic Party is committed to the review and overhaul of Civil Service laws to assure: insulation from political cronyism, accountability for nonfeasance as well as malfeasance, protection for the public servant who speaks out to identify corruption or failure, performance standards and incentives to reward efficiency and innovation and to assure non. discrimination and affirmative action in the recruitment, hiring and promotion of civil service employees. : We support the revision of the Hatch Act so as to extend to federal workers the same political rights enjoyed by other Americans as a birthright, while still protecting the Civil Service from political abuse. The Right to Integrity in Government The Democratic Party is pledged to the concept of full public disclosure by major public officials and urges appropriate legislation to effectuate this policy. We support divestiture of all financial holdings which directly conflict with official responsibilities and the development of uniform standards, review procedures and sanctions to identify and eliminate potential conflicts of interest. Tough, competent regulatory commissioners with proven commitment to the public interest are urgently needed. We will seek restrictions on ""revolving door"" careerism - the shuttling back and forth of officials between jobs in regulatory or procurement agencies and in regulated industries and government contractors. All diplomats, federal judges and other major officials should be selected on a basis of qualifications. At all levels of government services, we will recruit, appoint and promote women and minorities. We support legislation to ensure that the activities of lobbyists be more thoroughly revealed both within the Congress and the Executive agencies. The Democratic Party has led the fight to take the presidency off the auction block by championing the public financing of presidential elections. The public has responded with enthusiastic use of the $1 income tax checkoff. Similar steps must now he taken for congressional candidates. We call for legislative action to provide for partial public financing on a matching basis of the congressional elections, and the exploration of further reforms to insure the integrity of the electoral process. The Right to Fair Dealing by Government A citizen has the right to expect fair treatment from government Democrats are determined to find a means to make that right a reality. An Office of Citizen Advocacy should be established as part of the executive branch independent of any agency, with full access to agency records and with both the power and the responsibility to investigate complaints. Freedom of information requirements must he interpreted in keeping with the right at the individual to be free from anonymous accusation or slander. Each citizen has the right to know and to review any information directly concerning him or her held by the government for any purpose whatsoever under the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act of 1974, other than those exceptions set out in the Freedom of Information Act. Such information should be forthcoming promptly, without harassment and at a minimal cost to the citizen. Appropriate remedies must be found for citizens who suffer hardship as the result of abuse of investigative or prosecutorial powers. Business Accountability The Democratic Party believes that competition is preferable to regulation and that government has a responsibility to seek the removal of unreasonable restraints and barriers to competition. to restore and. where necessary, to stimulate the operation of market forces. Unnecessary regulations should he eliminated or revised. and the burden at excessive paperwork and red tape imposed on citizens and businesses should be removed. The Democratic Party encourages innovation and efficiency in the private sector. The Democratic Party also believes that strengthening consumer sovereignty - the ability of consumers to exercise free choice, to demand satisfaction, and to obtain direct redress of grievances - is similarly preferable to the present indirect government protection of consumers. However, government must not shark its responsibility to impose and rigorously enforce regulation where necessary to ensure health, safety and fairness. We reiterate our support for unflinching antitrust enforcement. and for the selection of an Attorney General free of political obligation and committed to rigorous antitrust prosecution. We shall encourage consumer groups to establish and operate consumer cooperatives that will enable consumers to provide themselves marketplace alternatives and to provide a competitive spur to profit-oriented enterprises. We support responsible cost saving in the delivery of professional services including the use of low-cost paraprofessionals, efficient group practice and federal standards for state no-fault insurance programs. We reiterate our support for full funding of neighborhood legal services for the poor. The Democratic Party is also committed to strengthening the knowledge and bargaining power of consumers through government-supported systems for developing objective product performance standards; advertising and labeling requirements for the disclosure of essential consumer information; and efficient and low-cost redress of consumer complaints including strengthened small claims courts, informal dispute settlement mechanisms, and consumer class actions. The Democratic Party is committed to making the U.S. Postal Service function properly as an essential public service. We reaffirm the historic Democratic commitment to assure the wholesomeness of consumer products such as food, chemicals, drugs and cosmetics, and the safety of automobiles, toys and appliances. Regulations demanding safe performance can be developed in a way that minimizes their own costs and actually stimulates product innovation beneficial to consumers. III. Government and Human Needs The American people are demanding that their national government act more efficiently and effectively in those areas of urgent human needs such as welfare reform, health care and education. However, beyond these strong national initiatives, state and local governments must be given an increased, permanent role in administering social programs. The federal government's role should be the constructive one of establishing standards and goals with increased state and local participation. There is a need for a new blueprint for the public sector, one which identifies and responds to national problems, and recognizes the proper point of administration for both new and existing programs. In shifting administrative responsibility, such programs must meet minimum federal standards. Government must concentrate, not scatter, its resources. It should not divide our people by inadequate and demeaning programs. The initiatives we propose do not require larger bureaucracy. They do require committed government. The Democratic Party realizes that accomplishing our goals in the areas of human needs will require time and resources. Additional resources will become available as we implement our full-employment policies. Federal revenues also grow over time. After full-employment has been achieved, $20-billion of increased revenue will be generated by a fully operating economy each year. The program detailed in the areas of human needs cannot be accomplished immediately, but an orderly beginning can be made and the effort expanded as additional resources become available. Health Care In 1975, national health expenditures averaged $547 per person - an almost 40 per cent increase in four years. Inflation and recession have combined to erode the effectiveness of the Medicare and Medicaid programs . An increasingly high proportion of health costs have been shifted back to the elderly. An increasing Republican emphasis on restricting eligibility and services is emasculating basic medical care for older citizens who cannot meet the rising costs of good health. We need a comprehensive national health insurance system with universal and mandatory coverage. Such a national health insurance system should be financed by a combination of employer-employee shared payroll taxes and general tax revenues. Consideration should be given to developing a means of support for national health insurance that taxes all forms of economic income. We must achieve all that is practical while we strive for what is ideal, taking intelligent steps to make adequate health services a right for all our people. As resources permit, this system should not discriminate against the mentally ill. Maximum personal interrelationships between patients and their physicians should be preserved. We should experiment with new forms of medical care delivery to mold a national health policy that will meet our needs in a fiscally responsible manner. We must shift our emphasis in both private and public health care away from hospitalization and acute-care services to preventive medicine and the early detection of the major cripplers and killers of the American people. We further support increased federal aid to government laboratories as well as private institutions to seek the cure to heart disease, cancer, sickle cell anemia, paralysis from spinal cord injury, drug addiction and other such inflictions. National health insurance must also bring about a more responsive consumer oriented system of health care delivery. Incentives must be used to increase the number of primary health care providers, and shift emphasis away from limited-application, technology- intensive programs. By reducing the barriers to primary preventive care, we can lower the need for costly hospitalization. Communities must be encouraged to avoid duplication of expensive technologies and meet the genuine needs of their populations. The development of community health centers must be resumed. We must develop new health careers, and promote a better distribution of health care professionals, including the more efficient use of paramedics. All levels of government should concern themselves with increasing the number of doctors and paramedical personnel in the field of primary health care. A further need is the comprehensive treatment of mental illness, including the development of Community Mental Health Centers that provide comprehensive social services not only to alleviate, but to prevent mental stresses resulting from social isolation and economic dislocation. Of particular importance is improved access to the health care system by underserved population groups. We must have national health insurance with strong built-in cost and quality controls. Rates for institutional care and physicians' services should be set in advance, prospectively. Alternative approaches to health care delivery, based on prepayment financing, should be encouraged and developed. Americans are currently spending $133-billion for health care - 8.3% of our Gross National Product. A return to full employment and the maintenance thereafter of stable economic growth will permit the orderly and progressive development of a comprehensive national health insurance program which is federally financed. Savings will result from the removal of inefficiency and waste in the current multiple public and private insurance programs and the structural integration of the delivery system to eliminate duplication and waste The cost of such a program need not exceed the share of the GNP this nation currently expends on health care; but the resulting improvement of health service would represent a major improvement in the quality of life enjoyed by Americans at all economic levels. Welfare Reform Fundamental welfare reform is necessary. The problems with our current chaotic and inequitable system of public assistance are notorious, Existing welfare programs encourage family instability. They have few meaningful work incentives. They do little or nothing for the working poor on substandard incomes, The patchwork of federal, state and local programs encourages unfair variations in benefit levels among the states, and benefits in many states are well below the standards for even lowest-income budgets. Of the current programs, only Food Stamps give universal coverage to all Americans in financial need. Cash assistance, housing aid and health care subsidies divide recipients into arbitrary categories. People with real needs who do not fit existing categories are ignored altogether. The current complexity of the welfare structure requires armies of bureaucrats at all levels of government. Food Stamps, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and Medicaid are burdened by unbelievably complex regulations, statutes and court orders. Both the recipients of these benefits, and the citizen who pays for them, suffer as a result. The fact that our current system is administered and funded at different levels of government makes it difficult to take initiatives to improve the status of the poor. We should move toward replacement of our existing inadequate and wasteful system with a simplified system of income maintenance, substantially financed by the federal government, which includes a requirement that those able to work be provided with appropriate available jobs or job training opportunities. Those persons who are physically able to work (other than mothers with dependent children) should be required to accept appropriate available jobs or job training. This maintenance system should embody certain basic principles. First and most important, it should provide an income floor both for the working poor and the poor not in the labor market. It must treat stable and broken families equally. It must incorporate a simple schedule of work incentives that guarantees equitable levels of assistance to the working poor. This reform may require an initial additional investment, but it offers the prospect of stabilization of welfare costs over the long run, and the assurance that the objectives of this expenditure will be accomplished. As an interim step, and as a means of providing immediate federal fiscal relief to state and local governments, local governments should no longer be required to bear the burden of welfare costs. Further, there should be a phased reduction in the states' share of welfare costs. Civil and Political Rights To achieve a just and healthy society and enhance respect and trust in our institutions, we must insure that all citizens are treated equally before the law and given the opportunity, regardless of race, color, sex, religion, age, language or national origin, to participate fully in the economic, social and political processes and to vindicate their legal and constitutional rights. In reaffirmation of this principle, an historic commitment of the Democratic Party, we pledge vigorous federal programs and policies of compensatory opportunity to remedy for many Americans the generations of injustice and deprivation; and full funding of programs to secure the implementation and enforcement of civil rights. We seek ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, to insure that sex discrimination in all its forms will be ended, implementation of Title IX, and elimination of discrimination against women in all federal programs. We support the right of all Americans to vote for President no matter where they live; vigorous enforcement of voting rights legislation to assure the constitutional rights of minority and language-minority citizens; the passage of legislation providing for registration by mail in federal elections to erase existing barriers to voter participation; and full home rule for the District of Columbia, including authority over its budget and local revenues, elimination of federal restrictions in matters which are purely local and voting representation in the Congress, and the declaration of the birthday of the great civil rights leader, Martin Luther King Jr., as a national holiday. We pledge effective and vigorous action to protect citizens privacy from bureaucratic and technological intrusions such as wiretapping and bugging without judicial scrutiny and supervision; and a full and complete pardon for those who are in legal or financial jeopardy because of their peaceful opposition to the Vietnam War, with deserters to be considered on a case-by-case basis. We fully recognize the religious and ethical nature of the concerns which many Americans have on the subject of abortion. We feel, however, that it is undesirable to attempt to amend the U.S. Constitution to overturn the Supreme Court decision in this area. The Democratic Party reaffirms and strengthens its legal and moral trust responsibilities to the American Indian. We believe it is honorable to obey and implement our treaty obligations to the first Americans. In discharging our duty, we shall exert all and necessary assistance to afford the American Indians the protection of their land, their water and their civil rights. Federal laws relating to American Indians and the functions and purposes of the Bureau of Indian Affairs should be re-examined. We support a provision in the immigration laws to facilitate acquisition of citizenship by Resident Aliens. We are committed to Puerto Rico's right to enjoy full self-determination and a relationship that can evolve in ways that will most benefit U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico. The Democratic Party respects and supports the present desire of the people of Puerto Rico to freely associate in permanent union with the United States, as an autonomous commonwealth or as a State. Education The goal of our educational policy is to provide our citizens with the knowledge and skills they need to live successfully. In pursuing this goal, we will seek adequate funding, implementation and enforcement of requirements in the education programs already approved by Congress. We should strengthen federal support of existing programs that stress improvement of reading and math skills. Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act must reach those it is intended to benefit to effectively increase these primary skills ""Break-throughs"" in compensatory education require a concentration of resources by each individual child and a mix of home and school activities that is not possible with the underfunded Republican programs. Compensatory education is realistic only when there is a stable sequence of funding that allows proper planning and continuity of programs, an impossibility under Republican veto and impoundment politics. We should also work to expand federal support in areas of educational need that have not yet been addressed sufficiently by the public schools - education of the handicapped, bilingual education and vocational education, and early childhood education. We propose federally financed, family-centered developmental and educational child care programs - operated by the public schools or other local organizations, including both private and community - and that they be available to all who need and desire them. We support efforts to provide for the basic nutritional needs of students. We recognize the right of all citizens to education pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the need in affected communities for bilingual and bicultural educational programs. We call for compliance with civil rights requirements in hiring and promotion in school systems. For the disadvantaged child, equal opportunity requires concentrated spending. And for all children, we must guarantee that jurisdictions of differing financial capacity can spend equal amounts on education. These goals do not conflict but complement each other. The principle that a child's education should depend on the property wealth of his or her school jurisdiction has been discredited in the last few years. With increased federal funds, it is possible to enhance educational opportunity by eliminating spending disparities within state borders. State-based equalizations, even state takeover of education costs, to relieve the overburdened property taxpayer and to avoid the inequities in the existing finance system, should be encouraged. The essential purpose of school desegregation is to give all children the same educational opportunities. Mite will continue to support that goal. The Supreme Court decision of 1954 and the aftermath were based on the recognition that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal, It is clearly our responsibility as a party and as citizens to support the principles of our Constitution. The Democratic Party pledges its concerted help through special consultation, matching funds incentive grants and other mechanisms to communities which seek education integrated both in terms of race and economic class, through equitable, reasonable and constitutional arrangements. Mandatory transportation of students beyond their neighborhoods for the purpose of desegregation remains a judicial tool of last resort for the purpose of achieving school desegregation. The Democratic Party will be an active ally of those communities which seek to enhance the quality as well as the integration of educational opportunities. We encourage a variety of other measures including the redrawing of attendance lines, pairing of schools, use of the ""magnet school"" concept, strong fair housing enforcement, and other techniques for the achievement of racial and economic integration . The Party reaffirms its support of public school education. The Party also renews its commitment to the support of a constitutionally acceptable method of providing tax aid for the education of all pupils in non-segregated schools in order to insure parental freedom in choosing the best education for their children. Specifically, the Party will continue to advocate constitutionally permissible federal education legislation which provides for the equitable participation in federal programs of all low and moderate income pupils attending all the nation's schools. The Party commits itself to support of adult education and training which will provide skills upgrading. In higher education, our Party is strongly committed to extending post-secondary opportunities for students from low and middle-income families, including older students and students who can attend only part-time. The Basic Educational Opportunity Grants should be funded at the full payment schedule, and campus-based programs of aid must be supported to provide a reasonable choice of institutions as well as access. With a coordinated and reliable system of grants, loans and work study, we can relieve the crisis in costs that could shut all but the affluent out of our colleges and universities. The federal government and the states must develop strategies to support institutions of higher education from both public and private sources. The federal government should directly provide cost of education payments to all higher education institutions, including predominantly black colleges, to help cover per-student costs which far exceed those covered by tuition and fees. Finally, government must systematically support basic and applied research in the liberal arts, the sciences, education and the professions - without political interference or bureaucratic restraint. The federal investment in graduate education should be sustained and selectively increased to meet the need for highly trained individuals. Trainee-ships and fellowships should be provided to attract the most talented students, especially among minority groups and women . Libraries should receive continuous and guaranteed support and the presently impounded funds for nationwide library planning and development should be released immediately. Social Services The Nixon-Ford administration would limit eligibility for federally-subsidized social services to the very poor. Social services can make significant changes in the lives of the non-poor, as well. The problems of alcoholism, drug abuse, mental retardation, child abuse or neglect, and mental illness arise at every income level, and quality day-care has become increasingly urgent for low- and middle-income families. Federal grants to the states should support a broad community-based program of social services to low- and middle-income families, to assure that these programs reach their intended populations. The states are now being required to take over an increasing share of existing social service programs. In 1972, the ceiling for federal social service grants was frozen at $2.5-billion, and subsequent inflation of 28 per cent has reduced the effective federal aid to existing programs. While there must certainly be a ceiling on such grants it should be raised to compensate for inflation and to encourage states and localities to expand social services to low- and moderate-income families. Disabled Citizens We support greater recognition of the problems of the disabled and legislation assuring that all people with disabilities have reasonable access to all public accommodations and facilities. The Democratic Party supports affirmative action goals for employment of the disabled. Older citizens The Democratic Party has always emphasized that adequate income and health care for senior citizens are basic federal government responsibilities. The recent failure of government to reduce unemployment and alleviate the impact of the rising costs of food, housing and energy have placed a heavy burden on those who live on fixed and limited incomes, especially the elderly. Our other platform proposals in these areas are designed to help achieve an adequate income level for the elderly. We will not permit an erosion of social security benefits, and while our ultimate goal is a health security system ensuring comprehensive and quality care for all Americans, health costs paid by senior citizens under the present system must be reduced. We believe that Medicare should be made available to Americans abroad who are eligible for Social Security. Democrats strongly support employment programs and the liberalization of the allowable earnings limitation under Social Security for older Americans who wish to continue working and living as productive citizens. We will put an end to delay in implementation of nutrition programs for the elderly and give high priority to a transportation policy for senior citizens under the Older Americans Act. We pledge to enforce vigorously health and safety standards for nursing homes, and seek alternatives which allow senior citizens where possible to remain in their own homes. Veterans America's veterans have been rhetorically praised by the Nixon-Ford administration at the same time that they have been denied adequate medical, education, pension and employment benefits. Vietnam veterans have borne the brunt of unemployment and economic mismanagement at home. As late as December 1975, the unemployment rate for Vietnam veterans was over 10 per cent. Younger Vietnam veterans (ages 20-24) have had unemployment rates almost twice the rate of similarly-aged non-veterans. Job training, placement, and information and counseling programs for veterans are inadequate. The Veterans Administration health care program requires adequate funding and improved management and health care delivery in order to provide high quality service and effectively meet the changing needs of the patient population. The next Democratic administration must act to rescue pensioner veterans below the poverty line. Thirty per cent of the veterans and 50 per cent of the widows receiving pensions have total incomes below the poverty line. Cost of living increases should be automatic in the Veterans' pension and disability system. Educational assistance should be expanded two years for those veterans already enrolled and drawing benefits in VA-approved educational and training programs . The Arts and Humanities We recognize the essential role played by the arts and humanities in the development of America. Our nation cannot afford to be materially rich and spiritually poor. We endorse a strong role for the federal government in reinforcing the vitality and improving the economic strength of the nation's artists and arts institutions, while recognizing that artists must be absolutely free of any government control. We would support the growth and development of the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities through adequate funding, the development of special anti-recession employment programs for artists, copyright reforms to protect the rights of authors, artists and performers, and revision of the tax laws that unfairly penalize artists. We further pledge our support for the concept and adequate financing of public broadcasting. IV. States, Counties and Cities More than eight years ago, the Werner Commission on Civil Disorders concluded that the disorders of the 1960s were caused by the deteriorating conditions of life in our urban centers - abject poverty, widespread unemployment, uninhabitable housing, declining services, rampant crime and disintegrating families. Many of these same problems plagued rural America as well. Little has been done by the Republican administrations to deal with these fundamental challenges to our society. This policy of neglect gives the lie to the current administration's rhetorical commitment to state and local governments. By tolerating intolerable unemployment, by vetoing programs for the poor, the old, and the ill, by abandoning the veterans and the young, and by withholding necessary funds for the decaying cities, the Nixon-Ford years have been years of retrogression in the nation's efforts to meet the needs of our cities. By abdicating responsibility for meeting these needs at the national level, the current administration has placed impossible burdens on fiscally hard-pressed state and local governments. In turn, local governments have been forced to rely excessively on the steadily diminishing and regressive property tax - which was originally designed to cover property related services and was never intended to support the services now required in many of our cities and towns. Federal policies and programs have inadvertently exacerbated the urban crisis. Within the framework of a new partnership of federal, state and local governments, and the private sector, the Democratic Party is pledged to the development of America's first national urban policy. Central to the success of that policy are the Democratic Party's commitments to full employment, incentives for urban and rural economic development, welfare reform, adequate health care, equalization of education expenditures, energy conservation and environmental quality. If progress were made in these areas, much of the inappropriately placed fiscal burden would be removed, and local governments could better fulfill their appropriate responsibilities. To assist further in relieving both the fiscal and service delivery problems of states and local governments, the Democratic Party reaffirms its support for general revenue sharing as a base for the fiscal health of all levels of government, acknowledging that the civil rights and citizens' participation provisions must be strengthened. We further believe that there must be an increase in the annual funding to compensate for the erosion of inflation. We believe the distribution formula should be adjusted to reflect better community and state needs, poverty levels, and tax effort. Finally, to alleviate the financial burden placed on our cities by the combination of inflation and recession, the Democratic Party restates its support for an emergency anti-recession aid to states and cities particularly hard hit by recession. Housing and Community Development In the past eight Republican years, housing has become a necessity priced as a luxury. Housing prices have nearly doubled in the past six years and housing starts have dropped by almost one-quarter The effect is that over three-fourths of American families cannot afford to buy an average-priced home. The basic national goal of providing decent housing and available shelter has been sacrificed to misguided tax, spending and credit policies which were supposed to achieve price stability but have failed to meet that goal. As a result, we do not have decent housing or price stability. The vision of the Housing Act of 1968, the result of three decades of enlightened Democratic housing policy, has been lost. The Democratic Party reasserts these goals and pledges to achieve them. The Democratic Party believes it is time for a housing and urban develop policy which recognizes the needs and difficulties of both the buying and renting public and the housing industry. We support a revitalized housing program which will be able to meet the public's need for housing at reasonable cost and the industry's need for relief from years of stagnation and now-chronic unemployment. We support direct federal subsidies and low interest loans to encourage the construction of low and moderate income housing. Such subsidies shall not result in unreasonable profit for builders, developers or credit institutions. We support the expansion of the highly successful programs of direct federal subsidies to provide housing for the elderly. We call for greatly increased emphasis on the rehabilitation of existing housing to rebuild our neighborhoods - a priority which is undercut by the current pattern of federal housing money which includes actual prohibitions to the use of funds for rehabilitation. We encourage public and private commitments to the preservation and renovation of our country's historic landmarks so that they can continue as a vital part of our commercial and residential architectural heritage. We will work to assure that credit institutions make greater efforts to direct mortgage money into the financing of private housing. We will take all necessary steps to prohibit the practice of red-lining by private financial institutions, the FHA, and the secondary mortgage market which have had the effect of depriving certain areas of the necessary mortgage funds which they need to upgrade themselves. We will further encourage an increase in loans and subsidies for housing and rehabilitation, especially in poverty stricken areas. We support greater flexibility in the use of community development block grants at the local level. The current Housing and Community Development Act should be reformed and. restructured so that its allocation, monitoring, and citizen participation features better address the needs of local communities, major cities and underdeveloped rural areas. The revitalization of our cities must proceed with an understanding that housing, jobs and related community facilities are all critical to a successful program. The Democratic Party will create the necessary incentives to insure that private and public jobs are available to meet the employment needs of these communities and pledges a more careful planning process for the location of the federal government's own employment-creation facilities. The Democratic Party proposes a revitalization of the Federal Housing Administration as a potent institution to stabilize new construction and existing housing markets. To this end, the Agency's policies must be simplified, its operating practices and insurance rate structures modernized and the sense of public service which was the hallmark of the FHA for so many years must be restored, In addition, we propose automatic triggering of direct production subsidies and a steady flow of mortgage funds during periods when housing starts fall below acceptable levels. Women, the elderly, single persons and minorities are still excluded from exercising their right to select shelter in the areas of their choice, and many ""high-risk"" communities are systematically denied access to the capital they require. The Democratic Party pledges itself to the aggressive enforcement of the Fair Housing Act to the promotion and enforcement of equal opportunity in housing; and to the pursuit of new regulatory and incentive policies aimed at providing minority groups and women with equal access to mortgage credit. In addition to direct attacks upon such known violations of the law, a comprehensive approach to these problems must include policies aimed at the underlying causes of unequal credit allocations. The Democratic Party pledges itself to aggressive policies designed to assure lenders that their commitments will be backed by government resources, so that investment risks will be shared by the public and private sectors. The Special Needs of Older Cities The Democratic Party recognizes that a number of major, older cities - including the nation's largest city - have been forced to undertake even greater social responsibilities, which have resulted in unprecedented fiscal crises. There is a national interest in helping such cities in their present travail, and a new Democratic President and the Congress shall undertake a massive effort to do so. Law Enforcement and Law Observance The total crime bill in the United States has been estimated at $90-billion a year, almost as much as the cost of our national defense. But over and above the economic impact, the raging and unchecked growth of crime seriously impairs the confidence of many of our citizens in their ability to walk on safe streets, to live securely in peaceful and happy homes, and to work Safely in their places of business. Fear mounts along with the crime rate. Homes are made into fortresses. In large sections of every major city, people are afraid to go out at night. Outside big cities, the crime rate is growing even faster, so that suburbs, small towns and rural areas are no longer secure havens. Defaulting on their ""law and order"" promises, the Republicans in the last eight years have let the rising tide of crime soil the highest levels of government, allowed the crime rate to skyrocket and failed to reform the criminal justice system. Recognizing that law enforcement is essentially a local responsibility, we declare that control of crime is an urgent national priority and pledge the efforts of the Democratic Party to insure that the federal government act effectively to reverse these trends and to be an effective partner to the cities and states in a well-coordinated war on crime. We must restore confidence in the criminal justice system by insuring that detection, conviction and punishment of lawbreakers is swift and sure; that the criminal justice system is just and efficient that jobs, decent housing and educational opportunities provide a real alternative to crime to those who suffer enforced poverty and injustice. We pledge equally vigorous prosecution and punishment for corporate crime, consumer fraud and deception; programs to combat child abuse and crimes against the elderly; criminal laws that reflect national needs; application of the law with a balanced and fair hand; a judiciary that renders equal justice for all; criminal sentences that provide punishment that actually punishes and rehabilitation that actually rehabilitates; and a correctional system emphasizing effective job training, educational and post-release programs. Only such measures will restore the faith of the citizens in our criminal justice system. Toward these ends, we support a major reform of the criminal justice system, but we oppose any legislative effort to introduce repressive and anti-civil libertarian measures in the guise of reform of the criminal code. The Law Enforcement Assistance Administration has not done its job adequately. Federal funding for crime-fighting must be wholly revamped to more efficiently assist local and state governments in strengthening their law enforcement and criminal justice systems, rather than spend money on the purchase of expensive equipment, much of it useless. Citizen confidence in law enforcement can be enhanced through increased citizen participation, by informing citizens of police and prosecutor policies, assuring that police departments reflect a cross-section of the communities they serve, establishing neighborhood forums to settle simple disputes, restoring the grand jury to fair and vigorous independence, establishing adequate victim compensation programs, and reaffirming our respect for the individual's right to privacy. Coordinated action is necessary to end the vicious cycle of drug addiction and crime. We must break up organized crime syndicates dealing in drugs, take necessary action to get drug pushers off the streets, provide drug users with effective rehabilitation programs, including medical assistance, ensure that all young people are aware of the costs of a life of drug dependency, and use worldwide efforts to stop international production and trafficking in illicit drugs . A Democratic Congress in 1974 passed the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act to come to grips with the fact that juveniles account for almost half of the serious crimes in the United States, and to remedy the fact that federal programs thus far have not met the crisis of juvenile delinquency. We pledge funding and implementation of this Act, which has been ignored by the Republican Administration. Handguns simplify and intensify violent crime. Ways must be found to curtail the availability of these weapons. The Democratic Party must provide the leadership for a coordinated federal and state effort to strengthen the presently inadequate controls over the manufacture, assembly, distribution and possession of handguns and to ban Saturday night specials. Furthermore, since people and not guns commit crimes, we support mandatory sentencing for individuals convicted of committing a felony with a gun. The Democratic Party, however, affirms the right of sportsmen to possess guns for purely hunting and target-shooting purposes. The full implementation of these policies will not in themselves stop lawlessness. To insure professionally trained and equitably rewarded police forces, law enforcement officers must be properly recruited and trained, and provided with decent wages, working conditions, support staff, and federal death benefits for those killed in line of duty. Effective police forces cannot operate without just and speedy court systems. We must reform bail and pre-trial detention procedures. We must assure speedy trials and ease court congestion by increasing the number of judges, prosecutors and public defenders. We must improve and streamline courthouse management procedures, require criminal justice records to be accurate and responsible, and establish fair and more uniform sentencing for crimes. Courts should give priority to crimes which are serious enough to deserve imprisonment. Law enforcement should emphasize the prosecution of crimes against persons and property as a higher priority than victimless crimes. Current rape laws need to be amended to abolish archaic evidence rules that discriminate against rape victims. We pledge that the Democratic Party will not tolerate abuses of governmental processes and unconstitutional action by the government itself. Recognizing the value of legitimate intelligence efforts to combat espionage and major crime, we call for new legislation to ensure that these efforts will no longer be used as an excuse for abuses such as bugging, wiretaps, mail opening and disruption aimed at lawful political and private activities. The Attorney General in the next Democratic administration will be an independent, non-political official of the highest integrity. If lawlessness is found at any level, in any branch, immediate and decisive action will be taken to root it out. To that end, we will establish the machinery for appointing an independent Special Prosecutor whenever needed. As a party, as a nation, we must commit ourselves to the elimination of injustice wherever it plagues our government, our people and our future. Transportation An effective national transportation policy must be grounded in an understanding of all transportation systems and their consequences for costs, reliability, safety, environmental quality and energy savings. Without public transportation, the rights of all citizens to jobs and social services cannot be met. To that end, we will work to expand substantially the discretion available to states and cities in the use of federal transportation money, for either operating expenses or capital programs on the modes of transportation which they choose. A greater share of Highway Trust Fund money should also be available on a flexible basis. We will change further the current restrictive limits on the use of mass transit funds by urban and rural localities so that greater amounts can be used as operating subsidies; we emphatically oppose the Republican administration's efforts to reduce federal operating subsidies. We are committed to dealing with the transportation needs of rural America by upgrading secondary roads and bridges and by completion of the original plan of 1956 for the interstate highway system where it benefits rural Americans. Among other benefits, these measures would help overcome the problems of getting products to market, and services to isolated persons in need. We will take whatever action is necessary to reorganize and revitalize our nation's railroads. We are also committed to the support of healthy trucking and bus, inland waterway and air transport systems. A program of national rail and road rehabilitation and improved mass transit would not only mean better transportation for our people, but it would also put thousands of unemployed construction workers back to work and make them productive tax-paying citizens once again. Further, it would move toward the Democratic Party's goal of assuring balanced transportation services for all areas of the nation-urban and rural. Such a policy is intended to reorganize both pressing urban needs and the sorry state of rural public transportation. Rural Development The problems of rural America are closely linked to those of our cities. Rural poor and the rural elderly suffer under the same economic pressures and have at least as many social needs as their counterparts in the cities. The absence of rural jobs and rural vitality and the continuing demise of the family farm have prompted a migration to our cities which is beyond the capacity of the cities to absorb. Over 20 million Americans moved to urban areas between 1940 and 1960 alone. We pledge to develop programs to make the family farm economically healthy again so as to be attractive to young people. To that end, the Democratic Party pledges to strengthen the economy and thereby create jobs in our great agricultural and rural areas by the full implementation and funding of the Rural Development Act of 1972 and by the adoption of an agricultural policy which recognizes that our capacity to produce food and fiber is one of our greatest assets. While it is bad enough to be poor, or old, or alone in the city, it is worse in the country, We are therefore committed to overcome the problems of rural as well as urban isolation and poverty by insuring the existence of adequate health facilities, critically-needed community facilities such as water supply and sewage disposal systems, decent housing, adequate educational opportunity and needed transportation throughout rural America. As discussed in the transportation section, we believe that transportation dollars should be available in a manner to permit their flexible use. In rural areas this means they could be used for such needs as secondary road improvement, taxi systems, buses, or other systems to overcome the problems of widely dispersed populations, to facilitate provisions of social services and to assure access of citizens to meet human needs. Two thousand family farms are lost per week. To help assure that family farms stay in the family where they belong, we will push increases in relevant estate tax exemptions. This increased exemption, when coupled with programs to increase generally the vitality of rural America, should mean that the demise of the family farm can be reversed. We will seek adequate levels of insured and guaranteed loans for electrification and telephone facilities. Only such a coordinated program can make rural America again attractive and vigorous, as it needs to be if we are to deal with the challenges facing the nation as a whole. Administration of Federal Aid Federal aid programs impose jurisdictional and administrative complications which substantially diminish the good accomplished by the federal expenditure of about $50-billion annually on state and local governments. An uncoordinated policy regarding eligibility requirements, audit guidelines, accounting procedures and the like compromise the over 800 categorical aid programs and threaten to bog down the more broadly conceived flexible block grant programs. The Democratic Party is committed to cutting through this chaos and simplifying the grant process for both recipient governments and program administrators. The Democratic Party also reaffirms the role of state and general purpose local governments as the principal governments in the orderly administration of federal aide and revenue sharing programs. V. Natural Resources and Environmental Quality Energy Almost three years have passed since the oil embargo. Yet, by any measure, the nation's energy lifeline is in far greater peril today. America is running out of energy - natural gas, gasoline and oil. The economy is already being stifled. The resulting threat of unemployment and diminished production is already present. If America, as we know it, is to survive, we must move quickly to develop renewable sources of energy. The Democratic Party will strive to replace the rapidly diminishing supply of petroleum and natural gas with solar, geothermal, wind, tide and other forms of energy, and we recommend that the federal government promptly expand whatever funds are required to develop new systems of energy. We have grown increasingly dependent on imported oil. Domestic production, despite massive price increases, continues to decline. Energy stockpiles, while authorized, are yet to be created. We have no agreements with any producing nations for security of supply. Efforts to develop alternative energy sources have moved forward slowly. Production of our most, available and plentiful alternative - coal - is not increasing. Energy conservation is still a slogan, instead of a program. Republican energy policy has failed because it is based on illusions; the illusion of a free market in energy that does not exist, the illusion that ever-increasing energy prices will not harm the economy, and the illusion of an energy program based on unobtainable independence. The time has come to deal with the realities of the energy crisis, not its illusions. The realities are that rising energy prices, falling domestic supply, increasing demand, and the threat to national security of growing imports, have not been contained by the private sector. The Democratic energy platform begins with a recognition that the federal government has an important role to play in insuring the nation's energy future, and that it must be given the tools it needs to protect the economy and the nation's consumers from arbitrary and excessive energy price increases and help the nation embark on a massive domestic energy program focusing on conservation, coal conversion, exploration and development of new technologies to insure an adequate short-term and long-term supply of energy for the nation's needs. A nation advanced enough and wealthy enough to send a man to the moon must dedicate itself to developing alternate sources of energy. Energy Pricing Enactment of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 established oil ceiling prices at levels sufficient to maximize domestic production but still below OPEC equivalents. The act was a direct result of the Democratic Congress commitment to the principle that beyond certain levels. increasing energy prices simply produce high-cost energy - without producing any additional energy supplies. This oil-pricing lesson should also be applied to natural gas. Those not pressing to turn natural gas price regulation over to OPEC, while arguing the rhetoric of so-called deregulation, must not prevail. The pricing of new natural gas is in need of reform. We should narrow the gap between oil and natural gas prices with new natural gas ceiling prices that maximize production and investment while protecting the economy and the consumer. Any reforms in the pricing of new natural gas should not be at the cost of severe economic dislocations that would accelerate inflation and increase unemployment . An examination must be made of advertising cost policies of utilities and the imposition of these costs on the consumer. Advertising costs used to influence public policy ought to be borne by stockholders of the utility companies and not by the consumers. Domestic Supply and Demand The most promising neglected domestic option for helping balance our energy budget is energy conservation. But major investments in conservation are still not being made. The Democratic Party will support legislation to establish national building performance standards on a regional basis designed to improve energy efficiency. We will provide new incentives for aiding individual homeowners, particularly average income families and the poor in undertaking conservation investments. We will support the reform of utility rate structures and regulatory rules to encourage conservation and ease the utility rate burden on residential users, farmers and other consumers who can least afford it; make more efficient use of electrical generating capacity, and we will aggressively pursue implementation of automobile efficiency standards and appliance labeling programs already established by Democratic initiative in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. Coal currently comprises 80 per cent of the nations energy resources, but produces only 16 per cent of the nation's energy. The Democratic Party believes that the United States' coal production can and must be increased without endangering the health and safety of miners, diminishing the land and water resources necessary for increased food production, and sacrificing the personal and property rights of farmers, ranchers and Indian tribes. We must encourage the production of the highest quality coal, closest to consuming markets, in order to insure that investments in energy production reinforce the economics of energy producing and consuming regions. Improved rail transportation systems will make coal available where it is actually needed, and will insure a rail transport network required for a healthy industrial and agricultural economy. We support an active federal role in the research and development of clean burning and commercially competitive coal burning systems and technologies, and we encourage the conversion to coal of industrial users of natural gas and imported oil. Air quality standards that make possible the burning of coal without danger to the public health or degradation of the nation's clear air must be developed and implemented. The Democratic Party wants to put an end to the economic depression, loss of life and environmental destruction that has long accompanied irresponsible coal development in Appalachia. Strip mining legislation designed to protect and restore the environment, while ending the uncertainty over the rules governing future coal mining, must be enacted. The huge reserves of oil, gas and coal on federal territory, including the outer continental shelf, belong to all the people. The Republicans have pursued leasing policies which give the public treasury the least benefit and the energy industry the most benefit from these public resources. Consistent with environmentally sound practices, new leasing procedures must be adopted to correct these policies, as well as insure the timely development of existing leases. Major federal initiatives, including major governmental participation in early high-risk development projects, are required if we are to harness renewable resources like solar, wind, geothermal, the oceans, and other new technologies such as fusion, fuel cells and the conservation of solid waste and starches into energy. The Ford Administration has failed to provide those initiatives, and, in the process, has denied American workers important new opportunities for employment in the building and servicing of emerging new energy industries. U.S. dependence on nuclear power should be kept to the minimum necessary to meet our needs. We should apply stronger safety standards as we regulate its use. And we must be honest with our people concerning its problems and dangers as well as its benefits. An increasing share of the nuclear research dollar must be invested in finding better solutions to the problems of nuclear waste disposal, reactor safety and nuclear safeguards - both domestically and internationally . Competition in the Domestic Petroleum Industry Legislation must be enacted to insure energy administrators and legislators access to information they need for making the kind of informed decisions that future energy policy will require. We believe full disclosure of data on reserves, supplies and costs of production should be mandated by law It is increasingly clear that there is no free, competitive market for crude oil in the United States. Instead, through their control of the nation's oil pipelines, refineries and marketing, the major oil producers have the capability of controlling the field and often the downstream price of almost all oil. When competition inadequate to insure free markets and maximum benefit to American consumers exists, we support effective restrictions on the right of major companies to own all phases of the oil industry. We also support the legal prohibition against corporate ownership of competing types of energy, such as oil and coal. We believe such ""horizontal"" concentration of economic power to be dangerous both to the national interest and to the functioning of the competitive system. Improved Energy Planning Establishment of a more orderly system for setting energy goals and developing programs for reaching those goals should be undertaken. The current proliferation of energy jurisdictions among many executive agencies underscores the need for a more coordinated system. Such a system should be undertaken, and provide for centralization of overall energy planning in a specific executive agency and an assessment of the capital needs for all priority programs to increase production and conservation of energy. Mineral Resources As with energy resources, many essential mineral resources may soon be inadequate to meet our growing needs unless we plan more wisely than we have with respect to energy. The Democratic Party pledges to undertake a long-range assessment of supply of our mineral reserves as well as the demand for them. Agriculture As a nation, we are blessed with rich resources of land, water and climate. When the supporting technology has been used to preserve and promote the family ownership and operation of farms and ranches, the people have been well served. America's farm families have demonstrated their ability and eagerness to produce food in sufficient quantity to feed their fellow citizens and share with hungry people around the world as well. Yet this national asset has been neither prudently developed nor intelligently used. The eight-year record of the Nixon-Ford administration is a record of lost opportunities, failure to meet the challenges of agricultural statesmanship, and favoritism to the special pleading of giant corporate agricultural interests. Republican misrule in agriculture has caused wide fluctuations in prices to producers, inflated food prices to consumers, unconscionable profiteering on food by business, unscrupulous shipping practices by grain traders, and the mishandling of our abundance in export markets. Republican agricultural policy has spelled high food prices, unstable farm income, windfalls for commodity speculators and multinational corporations, and confrontations between farmer and consumer. Foremost attention must be directed to the establishment of a national food and fiber policy which will be fair to both producer and consumer, and be based on the family farm agricultural system which has served the nation and the world so well for so long. Maximum agricultural production will be the most effective means of achieving an adequate food and fiber supply and reasonable price stability to American consumers. Without parity income assurance to farmers, full production cannot be achieved in an uncertain economy. We must assure parity returns to farmers based on costs of production plus a reasonable profit. We must continue and intensify efforts to expand agriculture's long-term markets abroad, and at the same time we must prevent irresponsible and inflationary sales from the American granary to foreign purchasers. Aggressive but stable and consistent export policy must be our goal. The production of food and fiber in America must be used as part of a constructive foreign policy based on long-term benefits at home and abroad, but not at the expense of the farmers. Producers shall be encouraged to produce at full capacity within the limits of good conservation practices, including the use of recycled materials, if possible and desirable, to restore natural soil fertility. Any surplus production needed to protect the people of the world from famine shall be stored on the farm in such a manner as to isolate it from the market place. Excess production beyond the needs of the people for food shall be converted to industrial purposes. Farmers as individual producers must deal constantly with organized suppliers and marketers, and compete with non-farm conglomerates. To assist them in bargaining for the tools of production, and to strengthen the institution of the family farm, the Democratic Party will: support the Capper-Volstead Act in its present form; curb the influence of non-farm conglomerates which, through the elimination of competition in the marketplace, pose a threat to farmers; support the farmer cooperatives and bargaining associations; scrutinize and remedy any illegal concentrations and price manipulations of farm equipment and supply industries; revitalize basic credit programs for farmers; provide adequate credit tailored to the needs of young farmers; assure access for farmers and rural residents to energy, transportation, electricity and telephone services; reinstate sound, locally administered soil conservation programs; eliminate tax shelter farming; and overhaul federal estate and gift taxes to alleviate some of the legal problems faced by farm families who would otherwise be forced to liquidate their assets to pay the tax. Long overdue are programs of assistance to farm workers in housing, employment, health, social services and education . To protect the health of our citizens the government shall insure that all agricultural imports must meet the same quality standards as those imposed on agricultural products produced in the United States and that only quality American agricultural products be exported. Fisheries America's fisheries must be protected and enhanced as a renewable resource through ecologically sound conservation practices and meaningful international agreements and compacts between individual states. Environmental Quality The Democratic Party's strong commitment to environmental quality is based on its conviction that environmental protection is not simply an aesthetic goal, but is necessary to achieve a more just society. Cleaning up air and water supplies and controlling the proliferation of dangerous chemicals is a necessary part of a successful national health program. Protecting the worker from workplace hazards is a key element of our full employment program. Occupational disease and death must not be the price of a weekly wage. The Democratic Party, through the Congress, has recognized the need for basic environmental security, and has authored a comprehensive program to achieve this objective. In eight years, the efforts to implement that program have been thwarted by an administration committed only to unfounded allegations that economic growth and environmental protection are incompatible . Quite to the contrary, the Democratic Party believes that a concern for the environment need not and must not stand in the way of a much-needed policy of high economic growth. Moreover, environmental protection creates jobs. Environmental legislation enacted since 1970 already has produced more than one million jobs, and we pledge to continue to work for additional laws to protect, restore and preserve the environment while providing still more jobs. Today, permanently harmful chemicals are dispersed, and irrecoverable land is rendered worthless. If we are to avoid repeated environmental crises, we must now renew our efforts to restore both environmental quality and economic growth. Those who would use the environment must assume the burden of demonstrating that it will not be abused. For too long this burden has been on government agencies representing the public, to assess and hopefully correct the damage that has already been done. Our irreplaceable natural and aesthetic resources must be managed to ensure abundance for future generations. Strong land and ocean use planning is an essential element of such management. The artifacts of the desert, the national forests, the wilderness areas, the endangered species, the coastal beaches and barrier dunes and other precious resources are in danger. They cannot be restored. They must be protected. Economic inequities created by subsidies for virgin materials to the disadvantage of recycled materials must be eliminated. Depletion allowances and unequal freight rates serve to discourage the growing numbers of businesses engaged in recycling efforts. Environmental research and development within the public sector should be increased substantially. For the immediate future, we must learn how to correct the damage we have already done, but more importantly, we need research on how to build a society in which renewable and non-renewable resources are used wisely and efficiently. Federal environmental anti-pollution requirement programs should be as uniform as possible to eliminate economic discrimination. A vigorous program with national minimum environmental standards fully implemented, recognizing basic regional differences, will ensure that states and workers are not penalized by pursuing environmental programs. The technological community should be encouraged to produce better pollution control equipment, and more importantly, to produce technology which produces less pollution. VI. International Relations The next Democratic administration must and will initiate a new American foreign policy. Eight-years of Nixon-Ford diplomacy have left our nation isolated abroad and divided at home. Policies have been developed and applied secretly and arbitrarily by the executive department from the time of secret bombing in Cambodia to recent covert assistance in Angola. They have been policies that relied on ad hoc unilateral maneuvering, and a balance-of-power diplomacy suited better to the last century than to this one. They have disdained traditional American principles which once earned the respect of other peoples while inspiring our own. Instead of efforts to foster freedom and justices in the world, the Republican administration has built a sorry record of disregard for human rights manipulative interference in the internal affairs of other nations, and, frequently a greater concern for our relations with totalitarian adversaries than with our democratic allies. And its efforts to preserve rather than reform, the international status quo betray a self-fulfilling pessimism that contradicts a traditional American belief in the possibility of human progress. Defense policy and spending for military forces must be consistent with meeting the real security needs of the American people We recognize that the security of our nation depends first and foremost on the internal strength of American society - economic, social and political. We also recognize that serious international threats to our security, such as shortages of food and raw materials, are not solely military in nature and cannot be met by military force or the threat of force. The Republican Administration has, through mismanagement and misguided policies, undermined the security of our nation by neglecting human needs at home while, for the first time in our nation's history, increasing military spending after a war. Billions of dollars have been diverted into wasteful, extravagant and, in some instances, destabilizing military programs. Our country can-and under a Democratic administration it will - work vigorously for the adoption of policies of full employment and economic growth which will enable us to meet both the justified domestic needs of our citizens and our needs for an adequate national defense. A Democratic administration will work to create a foreign policy that does justice to the strength and decency of the American people through adherence to these fundamental principles and priorities: We will act on the premise that candor in policy-making with all its liabilities, is preferable to deceit. The Congress will be involved in the major international decisions of our government, and our foreign policies will be openly and consistently presented to the American people. For even if diplomatic tactics and national security information must sometimes remain secrets there can be no excuse for formulating and executing basic policy Without public understanding and support. Our policy must be based on our nation's commitment to the ideal of individual freedom and justice. Experience has taught us not to rely solely on military strength or economic power, as necessary as they are, in pursuit of our international objectives. We must rely too on the moral strength of our democratic values - the greatest inspiration to our friends and the attribute most feared by our enemies. We will ensure that human needs are not sacrificed to military spending, while maintaining the military forces we require for our security. We will strengthen our ties to the other great democracies, working together to resolve common economic and social problems as well as to keep our defenses strong. We will restore the Democratic tradition of friendship and support to Third World nations. We must also seek areas of cooperation with our traditional adversaries. There is no other option, for human survival itself is at stake. But pursuit of detente will require maintenance of a strong American military deterrent, hard bargaining for our own interest, recognition of continuing competition, and a refusal to oversell the immediate benefits of such a policy to the American public. We will reaffirm the fundamental American commitment to human rights across the globe. America must work for a release of all political prisoners - men and women who are in jail simply because they have opposed peacefully the policies of their governments or have aided others who have - in all countries. America must take a firm stand to support and implement existing U.S. law to bring about liberalization of emigration policy in countries which limit or prohibit free emigration. America must be resolute in its support of the right of workers to organize and of trade unions to act freely and independently, and in its support of freedom of the press. America must continue to stand as a bulwark in support of human liberty in all countries. A return to the politics of principle requires a reaffirmation of human freedom throughout the world. The Challenge of Interdependence The International Economy Eight years of mismanagement of the American economy have contributed to global recession and inflation. The most important contribution a Democratic administration will make to the returning health of the world economy will be to restore the health of our own economy, with all that means to international economic stability and progress. We are committed to trade policies that can benefit a full employment economy - through creation of new jobs for American workers, new markets for American farmers and businesses, and lower prices and a wider choice of goods for American consumers. Orderly reductions in trade barriers should be negotiated on a reciprocal basis that does not allow other nations to deny us access to their markets while enjoying access to ours. These measures must be accompanied by improved programs to ease dislocations and to relieve the hardship of American workers affected by foreign competition. The Democratic Party will also seek to promote higher labor standards in those nations where productivity far outstrips wage rates, harming American workers through unfair exploitation of foreign labor, and encouraging American capital to pursue low wage opportunities that damage our own economy and weaken the dollar. We will exert leadership in international efforts to strengthen the world economic system. The Ford administration philosophy of reliance on the international ""market economy"" is insufficient in a world where some governments and multinational corporations are active in managing and influencing market forces. We pledge constant efforts to keep world monetary systems functioning properly in order to provide a reasonably stable economic environment for business and to prevent the importation of inflation. We will support reform of the international monetary system to strengthen institutional means of coordinating national economic policies, especially with our European and Japanese allies, thus facilitating efforts by our government and others to achieve full employment. The Democratic Party is committed to a strong and competitive merchant fleet, built in the United States and manned by American seamen, as an instrument of international relations and national security. In order to revitalize our merchant Feet, the party pledges itself to a higher level of coordination of maritime policy, reaffirmation of the objectives of the Merchant Marine Acts of 1936 and 1970, and the development of a national cargo policy which assures the U.S. Beet a fair participation in all U.S. trade. A Democratic administration will vigorously pursue international negotiations to insure that the multinational activities of corporations, whether American or foreign, he made more responsible to the international community. We will give priority attention to the establishment of an international code of conduct for multinational corporations and host countries. We will encourage multinational corporations - before they relocate production across international boundaries - to make sufficient advance arrangements for the workers whose jobs will be affected. We will eliminate bribery and other corrupt practices. We will prevent these corporations from interfering in the political systems of the countries in which they operate. If such a code cannot be negotiated or proves to be unenforceable, our country should reserve the right to take unilateral action directed toward each of these problems, specifically including the outlawing of bribes and other improper payments to government officials of other nations. In pursuit of open and fair international economic relationships, we will seek mechanisms, including legislation, to ensure that foreign governments cannot introduce third party boycotts or racial and religious discrimination into the conduct of American foreign commerce. Energy The United States must be a leader in promoting cooperation among the industrialized countries in developing alternative energy sources and reducing energy consumption, thus reducing our dependence on imports from the Middle East and restraining high energy prices. Under a Democratic Administration, the United States also will support international efforts to develop the vast energy potential of the developing countries. We will also actively seek to limit the dangers inherent in the international development of atomic energy and in the proliferation of nuclear weapons, Steps to be given high priority will include: revitalization of the Nonproliferation Treaty, expansion of the International Atomic Energy Agency and other international safeguards and monitoring of national facilities, cooperation against potential terrorism involving nuclear weapons, agreement by suppliers not to transfer enrichment or reprocessing facilities, international assurance of supply of nuclear fuel only to countries cooperating with strict nonproliferation measures, subsidization of multinational nuclear facilities, and gradual conversion to international control of non-weapons fissionable material. The Developing World We have a historic opportunity in the next decade to improve the extent and quality of cooperation between the rich and poor countries. The potential benefits to our nation of a policy of constructive cooperation with the developing world would be considerable: uninterrupted access at reasonable cost to raw materials and to basic commodities; lower rates of global inflation, improved world markets for our goods; and a more benign atmosphere for international negotiation in general. Above all, the prospects for the maintenance of peace will be vastly higher in a world in which fewer and fewer people suffer the pangs of hunger and the yoke of economic oppression. We support efforts to stabilize and increase export earnings of developing countries through our participation in reasonable commodity arrangements. We support strengthening of global financing mechanisms and trade liberalization efforts. We will assist in promoting greater developing country capital markets. Because our country provides food and fiber to all the world, the American farmer is heavily dependent on world markets. These markets must be developed in a way that prevents the wild gyrations of food prices and the periodic shortages that have been common under recent Republican Administrations. We pledge significant financial support to the International Fund for Agricultural Development; more effective food aid through further revision of the U.S. Food for Peace program; significant contributions to a multinational world food reserve system, with appropriate safeguards for American farmers; and continuing efforts to promote American food exports. The proliferation in arms, both conventional and nuclear, is a principal potential source of conflict in the developing as well as the industrialized world. The United States should limit significantly conventional arms sales and reduce military aid to developing countries, should include conventional arms transfers on the arms control agenda, and should regulate country-by-country justification for U.S. arms transfers, whether by sales or aid. Such sales or aid must be justified in terms of foreign policy benefits to the United States and not simply because of their economic value to American weapons producers. A primary object of American aid, both military and economic, is first of all to enhance the condition of freedom in the world. The United States should not provide aid to any government - anywhere in the world - which uses secret police, detention without charges, and torture to enforce its powers. Exceptions to this policy should be rare, and the aid provided should be limited to that which is absolutely necessary. The United States should be open and unashamed in its exercise of diplomatic efforts to encourage the observance of human rights in countries which receive American aid. Current world population growth is a threat to the long-range well-being of mankind. We pledge to support effective voluntary family planning around the world, as well as at home, and to recognize officially the link between social and economic development and the willingness of the individual to limit family size. To be true to the traditional concern of Americans for the disadvantaged and the oppressed, our aid programs should focus on alleviating poverty and on support of the quest for human liberty and dignity. We will work to see that the United States does its fair share in international development assistance efforts, including participation in the fifth replenishment of the World Bank's International Development Association. We will implement a foreign assistance policy which emphasizes utilization of multilateral and regional development institutions, and one that includes a review of aid programs, country by country, to reinforce those projects whose financial benefits go to the people most in need and which are consistent with overall United States foreign policy goals. The World Environment Decay of the environment knows no national boundary. A government committed to protect our environment knows no national boundary. A government committed to protect our environment at home must also seek international cooperation in defending the global environment. Working through and supporting such organizations as the United Nations Environmental Program, we will join other governments in more effective efforts to preserve the quality and resources of the oceans; to preserve endangered species of fish and wildlife; to reverse the encroachment of the deserts, the erosion of the world's agricultural lands, and the accelerating destruction of its forests; to limit pollution of the atmosphere; and to control alterations of the global climate. Criminal Justice Rights of Americans Abroad We will protect the rights and interests of Americans charged with crimes or jailed in foreign countries by vigorously exerting all appropriate efforts to guarantee humane treatment and due process and to secure extradition to the United States where appropriate. International Drug Traffic We call for the use of diplomatic efforts to stop international production and trafficking in illicit drugs including the possible cut-off of foreign aid to noncooperating countries. Defense Policy The size and structure of our military forces must be carefully related to the demands of our foreign policies in this new era. These should be based on a careful assessment of what will be needed in the long-run to deter our potential adversaries, to fight successfully, if necessary, conventional wars in areas in which our national security is threatened, and to reassure our allies and friends - notably in Western Europe, Japan and the Near East. To this end, our strategic nuclear forces must provide a strong and credible deterrent to nuclear attack and nuclear blackmail. Our conventional forces must be strong enough to deter aggression in areas whose security is vital to our own. In a manner consistent with these objectives, we should seek those disarmament and arms control agreements which will contribute to mutual reductions in both nuclear and conventional arms. The hallmarks of the Nixon-Ford administration's defense policy, however, have been stagnation and vulnerability. By its reluctance to make changes in those features of our armed forces which were designed to deal with the problems of the past, the Administration has not only squandered defense dollars, but also neglected making improvements which area needed to increase our forces' fighting effectiveness and their capability to deter future aggression. By its undue emphasis on the overall size of the defense budget as the primary measure of both our national resolve and the proficiency of our armed forces, the administration has forgotten that we are seeking not to outspend, but to be able to deter and, if necessary, outfight our potential adversaries. While we must spend whatever is legitimately needed for defense, cutbacks on duplication and waste are both feasible and essential. Barring any major change in the international situation, with the proper management, with the proper kind of investment of defense dollars, and with the proper choice of military programs we believe we can reduce present defense spending by about $5-billion to $7-billion. We must be tough-minded about the development of new weapons systems which add only marginal military value. The size of our defense budget should not be dictated by bureaucratic imperatives or the needs of defense contractors but by our assessment of international realities. In order to provide for a comprehensive review of the B-1 test and evaluation program, no decision regarding B-1 production should be made prior to February 1977. The Pentagon has one of the federal government's most overgrown bureaucracies. The Department of Defense can be operated more effectively and efficiently and its budget reduced, without in any way compromising our defense posture. Our armed forces have many more admirals and generals today than during World War II, when our fighting force was much larger than now. We can reduce the ratio of officers to men and of support forces to combat troops. Misdirected efforts such as the construction of pork-barrel projects under the jurisdiction of the Defense Department can be terminated. Exotic arms systems which serve no defense or foreign policy purpose should not be initiated. By ignoring opportunities to use our advanced technology innovatively to obtain maximum effectiveness in weapons and minimize complexity and cost, the Republican administration has failed to reverse the trend toward increasingly intricate and expensive weapons systems. Thus. it has helped to put our forces - particularly the Navy - on the dangerous path of becoming both smaller in numbers and more vulnerable. A new approach is needed. Our strategic nuclear forces should be structured to ensure their ability to survive nuclear attack, thereby assuring deterrence of nuclear war. Successful nuclear deterrence is the single most important task of our armed forces. We should, however, avoid becoming diverted into making expenditures which have only symbolic or prestige value or which themselves contribute to nuclear instability The United States Navy must remain the foremost fleet in the world. Our naval forces should be improved to stress survivability and our modern technology should he used in new ways to keep the essential sea lanes open. Concretely we should put more stress on new sensors and armaments and give priority to a navy consisting of a greater number of smaller and less vulnerable vessels. Our land forces should be structured to fight effectively in support of our political and military commitments. To this end, modern, well-equipped and highly mobile land forces are more important than large numbers of sparsely-equipped infantry divisions . Our tactical air forces should be designed to establish air superiority quickly in the event of hostilities, and to support our land and naval forces. We can and will make significant economies in the overhead and support Structure of our military forces. The defense procurement system should be reformed to require, wherever possible and consistent with efforts to encourage full participation by small and minority businesses, advertised competitive bids and other improvements in procurement procedure so as to encourage full and fair competition among potential contractors and to cut the current waste in defense procurement. A more equitable formula should be considered for distribution of defense contracts and other federal procurement on a state or regional basis. The United States and other nations share a common interest in reducing military expenditures and transferring the savings into activities which raise living standards. In order to smooth the path for such changes, the Executive Branch and the Congress should encourage long-range planning by defense-dependent communities and managements of defense firms and unions. This process should take place within the context of the Democratic Party's commitment to planned full employment. Our civilian and military intelligence agencies should be structured to provide timely and accurate information and analysis of foreign affairs and military matters. Covert action must be used only in the most compelling cases where the national security of the U.S. is vitally involved; assassination must be prohibited. There should be full and thorough congressional oversight of our intelligence agencies. The constitutional rights of American citizens can and must be fully protected, and intelligence abuses corrected, without endangering the confidentiality of properly classified intelligence or compromising the fundamental intelligence mission . U.S.-U.S.S.R. Relations The United States and the Soviet Union are the only powers who, by rivalry or miscalculation, could bring general nuclear war upon our civilization. A principal goal must be the continued reduction of tension with the U.S.S.R. This can, however, only be accomplished by fidelity to our principles and interests and through businesslike negotiations about specific issues, not by the bad bargains, dramatic posturing, and the stress on general declarations that have characterized the Nixon-Ford administration's detente policy. Soviet actions continue to pose severe threats to peace and stability in many parts of the world and to undermine support in the West for fruitful negotiations toward mutually beneficial agreements. The U.S.S.R. has undertaken a major military buildup over the last several years in its navy, in its strategic forces, and in its land forces stationed in Eastern Europe and Asia. It has sought one-sided advantages in negotiations, and has exerted political and military pressure in such areas as the Near East and Africa, not hesitating to dispatch to Angola its own advisors as well as the expeditionary forces of its clients. The continued U.S.S.R. military dominance of many Eastern European countries remains a source of oppression for the peoples of those nations, an oppression we do not accept and to which we are morally opposed. Any attempt by the Soviet Union similarly to dominate other parts of Europe - such as Yugoslavia - would be an action posing a grave threat to peace. Eastern Europe will not truly be an area of stability until these countries regain their independence and become part of a large European framework. Our task is to establish U.S.-U.S.S.R. relations on a stable basis, avoiding excesses of both hope and fear. Patience, a clear sense of our own priorities, and a willingness to negotiate specific firm agreements in areas of mutual interest can return balance to relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. In the field of nuclear disarmament and arms control we should work toward: limitations on the international spread of fissionable materials and nuclear weapons; specific strategic arms limitation agreements which will increase the stability of the strategic balance and reduce the risk of nuclear war, emphasizing mutual reductions and limitations on future weapons deployment which most threaten the strategic balance because their characteristics indicate a potential firststrike use; a comprehensive ban on nuclear tests; mutual reduction with the Soviet Union and others, under assured safeguards, of our nuclear arsenals, leading ultimately to the elimination of such arsenals; mutual restrictions with the Soviet Union and others on sales or other transfers of arms to developing countries; and conventional arms agreements and mutual and balanced force reductions in Europe. However, in the area of strategic arms limitation, the U.S. should accept only such agreements that would not over-all limit the U.S. to levels of intercontinental strategic forces inferior to the limits provided for the Soviet Union. In the long-run, further development of more extensive economic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union may bring significant benefit to both societies. The U.S.S.R. has sought, however, through unfair trade practices to dominate such strategic fields as merchant shipping. Rather than effectively resisting such efforts, the Nixon-Ford administration has looked favorably on such steps as subsidizing U.S.-U.S.S.R. trade by giving the Soviet Union concessionary credits, promoting trade increases because of a short-run hope of using trade to modify political behavior, and even placing major United States energy investments in pawn to Soviet Union policy. Where bilateral trade agreements with the U.S.S.R. are to our economic advantage, we should pursue them, but our watch-words would be tough bargaining and concrete economic, political or other benefits for the United States. We should also press the Soviet Union to take a greater share of responsibility in multilateral solutions to such problems as creating adequate world grain reserves. Our stance on the issue of human rights and political liberties in the Soviet Union is important to American self-respect and our moral standing in the world. We should continually remind the Soviet Union, by word and conduct, of its commitments in Helsinki to the free flow of people and ideas and of how offensive we and other free people find its violations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As part of our programs of official, technical, trade, cultural and other exchanges with the U.S.S.R., we should press its leaders to open their society to a genuine interchange of people and ideas. We must avoid assuming that the whole of American-Soviet relations is greater than the sum of its parts, that any agreement is superior to none, or that we can negotiate effectively as supplicants. We must realize that our firmness can help build respect for us and improve the long-run opportunities for mutually-beneficial concrete agreements. We must beware of the notion that Soviet-American relations are a seamless web in which concessions in one area will bring us benefits in others. By the same token, we must husband our resources to concentrate on what is most important to us. Detente must be military as well as political. More fundamentally, we must recognize that the general character of our foreign policies will not and must not be set by our direct relationship with the Soviet Union. Our allies and friends must come first. Nor can the pursuit of our interests elsewhere in the world be dominated by concern for Soviet views. For example, American policy toward China should continue to be based on a desire for a steady improvement and broadening of relations, whatever the tenor and direction of Chinese-Soviet relations. Above all, we must be open, honest, mature and patient with ourselves and with our allies. We must recognize that, in the long-run, an effective policy toward the Soviet Union can only be grounded on honest discussion, and on a national and, to some extent, an international consensus. Our own institutions, especially the Congress, must be consulted and must help formulate our policy. The governments of our allies and friends must be made partners in our undertakings. Haste and secret bilateral executive arrangements in our dealings with the U.S.S.R. can only promote a mood of uncertainty and suspicion which undermines the public support essential to effective and stable international relations. America in the World Community Many of the critical foreign policy issues we face require global approaches, but an effective international role for the United States also demands effective working with the special interests of specific foreign nations and regions. The touchstone of our policy must be our own interests, which in turn means that we should not seek or expect to control events everywhere. Indeed, intelligent pursuit of our objectives demands a realization that even where our interests are great and our involvement essential, we do not act alone, but in a world setting where others have interests and objectives as well. We cannot give expression to our national values without continuing to play a strong role in the affairs of the United Nations and its agencies. Firm and positive advocacy of our positions is essential. We should make a major effort at reforming and restructuring the U.N. systems. The intensity of interrelated problems is rapidly increasing, and it is likely that in the future, the issues of war and peace will be more a function of economic and social problems than of the military security problems that have dominated international relations since 1945. The heat of debate at the General Assembly should not obscure the value of our supporting United Nations involvement in keeping the peace and in the increasingly complex technical and social problems-such as pollution, health, economic development and population growth-that challenge the world community, But we must let the world know that anti-American polemics is no substitute for sound policy and that the United Nations is weakened by harsh rhetoric from other countries or by blasphemous resolutions such as the one equating Zionism and racism. A Democratic Administration should seek a fair and comprehensive Law-of-the-Sea Treaty that will balance the interests of the developed and less developed countries. Europe The nations of Western Europe, together with Japan, are among our closest allies. Except for our closest neighbors in this hemisphere, it is in these regions where our interests are most strongly linked with those of other nations. At the same time, the growing economic and political strength of Europe and Japan creates areas of conflict and tension in a relationship both sides must keep close and healthy. On the great economic issues - trade, energy, employment, international finance, resources - we must work with the Europeans, the Japanese and other nations to serve our long-run mutual interests in stability and growth, and in the development of poorer nations. The military security of Europe is fundamental to our own. To that end, NATO remains a vital commitment. We should retain in Europe a U.S. contribution to NATO forces so that they are sufficient to deter or defeat attack without premature resort to nuclear weapons. This does not exclude moderate reductions in manpower levels made possible by more efficiency, and it affirmatively requires a thorough reform and overhaul of NATO forces, plans and deployments. We encourage our European allies to increase their share of the contributions to NATO defense, both in terms of troops and hardware. By mutual agreement or through modernizations, the thousands of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe should be reduced, saving money and manpower and increasing our own and international security. Europe, like the rest of the world, faces substantial political change. We cannot control that process. However, we can publicly make known our preference for developments consistent with our interests and principles. In particular, we should encourage the most rapid possible growth of stable democratic institutions in Spain, and a continuation on the path of democracy of Portugal and Greece, opposing authoritarian takeover from either left or right. We can make clear our sense of the risks and dangers of Communist participation in Western European governments, while being equally clear that we will work on a broad range of non-military matters with any legally-constituted government that is prepared to do the same with us. We similarly must reaffirm our support for the continued growth and cohesion of the institutions of the European community. The voice of the United States should be heard in Northern Ireland against violence and terror, against the discrimination, repression and deprivation which brought about that civil strife, and for the efforts of the parties toward a peaceful resolution of the future of Northern Ireland. Pertinent alliances such as NATO and international organizations such as the United Nations should be fully apprised of the interests of the United States with respect to the status of Ireland in the international community of nations. We must do all that is possible, consistent with our interest in a strong NATO in Southern Europe and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean, to encourage a fair settlement of the Cyprus issue, which continues to extract human costs. Middle East We shall continue to seek a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. The cornerstone of our policy is a firm commitment to the independence and security of the State of Israel. This special relationship does not prejudice improved relations with other nations in the region. Real peace in the Middle East will permit Israel and her Arab neighbors to turn their energies to internal development and will eliminate the threat of world conflict spreading from tensions there. The Middle East conflict is complex, and a realistic, pragmatic approach is essential. Our policy must be based on firm adherence to these fundamental principles of Middle East policy: We will continue our consistent support of Israel, including sufficient military and economic assistance to maintain Israel's deterrent strength in the region, and the maintenance of U.S. military forces in the Mediterranean adequate to deter military intervention by the Soviet Union. We steadfastly oppose any move to isolate Israel in the international arena or suspend it from the United Nations or its constituent organizations. We will avoid efforts to impose on the region an externally devised formula for settlements and will provide support for initiatives toward settlement, based on direct face to-face negotiation between the parties and normalization of relations and a full peace within secure and defensible boundaries. We vigorously support the free passage of shipping in the Middle East - especially in the Suez Canal. We recognize that the solution to the problems of Arab and Jewish refugees must be among the factors taken into account in the course of continued progress toward peace. Such problems cannot be solved, however. by recognition of terrorist groups which refuse to acknowledge their adversary's right to exist, or groups which have no legitimate claim to represent the people for whom they purport to be speaking. We support initiation of government enforcement action to insure that stated U.S. policy - in opposition to boycotts against friendly countries - is fully and vigorously implemented. We recognize and support the established status of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. with free access to all its holy places provided to all faiths. As a symbol of this stand, the U.S. Embassy should be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Asia We remain a Pacific power with important stakes and objectives in the region, but the Vietnam War has taught us the folly of becoming militarily involved where our vital interests were not at stake. Friendship and cooperation with Japan are the cornerstone of our Asian interests and policy. Our commitment to the security of Japan is central to our own, and it is an essential condition to a constructive peaceful role for that nation in the future of Asia. In our economic dealings with Japan, we must make clear our insistence on mutuality of benefits and opportunities, while focusing on ways to expand our trade avoiding economic shocks and resultant retaliation on either side. We must avoid the ""shocks"" to Japan which have resulted from Republican foreign policy. We reaffirm our commitment to the security of the Republic of Korea, both in itself and as a key to the security of Japan. However, on a prudent and carefully planned basis, we can redeploy, and gradually phase out, the U.S. ground forces, and can withdraw the nuclear weapons now stationed in Korea without endangering that support as long as our tactical air and naval forces in the region remain strong. Our continued resolve in the area should not be misunderstood. However, we deplore the denial of human rights in the Republic of Korea just as we deplore the brutal and aggressive acts of the regime in North Korea. We have learned, at a tragically high price, certain lessons regarding Southeast Asia. We should not seek to control the political future of that region. Rather, we should encourage and welcome peaceful relations with the nations of that area. In conjunction with the fullest possible accounting of our citizens still listed as missing in action, we should move toward normalized relations with Vietnam. No foreign policy that reflects traditional American humanitarian concerns can be indifferent to the plight of the peoples of the Asian subcontinent. The recent improvement in relations with China, which has received bipartisan support, is a welcome recognition that there are few areas in which our vital interests clash with those of China. Our relations with China should continue to develop on peaceful lines, including early movement toward normalizing diplomatic relations in the context of a peaceful resolution of the future of Taiwan. The Americas We recognize the fundamental importance of close relations and the easing of economic tension with our Canadian and Mexican neighbors. In the last eight years, our relations with Latin America have deteriorated amid high-level indifference, increased military domination of Latin American governments, and revelations of extensive American interference in the internal politics of Chile and other nations. The principles of the Good Neighbor Policy and the Alliance for Progress, under which we are committed to working with the nations of the Americas as equals, remain valid today but seem to have been forgotten by the present administration. The U.S. should adopt policies on trade, aid and investment that include commodity agreements and an appropriate system of trade preferences. We must make clear our revulsion at the systematic violations of basic human rights that have occurred under some Latin American military regimes. We pledge support for a new Panama Canal treaty, which insures the interests of the United States in that waterway, recognizes the principles already agreed upon, takes into account the interests of the Canal work force, and which will have wide hemispheric support. Relations with Cuba can only be normalized if Cuba refrains from interference in the internal affairs of the United States and releases all U.S. citizens currently detained in Cuban prisons and labor camps for political reasons. We can move towards such relations if Cuba abandons its provocative international actions and policies . Africa Eight years of indifference, accompanied by increasing cooperation with racist regimes, have left our influence and prestige in Africa at an historical low. We must adopt policies that recognize the intrinsic importance of Africa and its development to the United States, and the inevitability of majority rule on that continent. The first task is to formulate a rational African policy in terms of enlightened U.S. African priorities, not a corollary of U.S.-Soviet policy. Angola demonstrated that we must have sound relations with Black Africa and disassociate our policies from those of South Africa to achieve the desired African response to Soviet expansionism in Africa. Our policy must foster high-level U.S.-Africa communications and establish a sound basis for dealing when crises arise. The next Democratic administration will work aggressively to involve black Americans in foreign policy positions, at home and abroad, and in decisions affecting African interests. To promote African economic development, the U.S. should undertake increased bilateral and multilateral assistance, continue congressional initiatives in food assistance and food production, with special aid to the Sahel and implementation of the Sahel Development Plan; and carry forward our commitment to negotiate with developing countries on key trade and economic issues such as commodity arrangements and trade preferences . Our policy must be reformulated towards unequivocal and concrete support of majority rule in Southern Africa, recognizing that our true interests lie in peaceful progress toward a free South Africa for all South Africans, black and white. As part of our commitment to the development of a free and democratic South Africa, we should support the position of African nations in denying recognition to ""homelands"" given pseudoindependence by the South African government under its current policy of ""separate development."" The Republican administration's relaxation of the arms embargo against South Africa must be ended, and the embargo tightened to prevent transfers of military significance, particularly of nuclear material. The U.S. government should not engage in any activity regarding Namibia that would recognize or support the illegal South African administration, including granting tax credits to U.S. companies doing business in Namibia and paying taxes to South Africa. Moreover, the U.S. government should deny tax advantages to all corporations doing business in South Africa and Rhodesia who support or participate in apartheid practices and policies . The U.S. government should fully enforce the U.N.-ordered Rhodesia sanctions, seek universal compliance with such measures, and repeal the Byrd Amendment. Efforts should be made to normalize relations with Angola.",139585,21303,"preamble we meet to adopt a democratic platform, and to nominate democratic candidates for president and vice president of the united states, almost years from the day that our revolutionary founders declared this country's independence from the british crown. the founder of the democratic party, thomas jefferson of virginia - set forth the reasons for this separation and expressed the basic tenets of democratic government: that all persons are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness - that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among people, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. these truths may still be self-evident, but they have been tragically abused by our national government during the past eight years. two republican administrations have both misused and mismanaged the powers of national government, obstructing the pursuit of economic and social opportunity, causing needless hardship and despair among millions of our fellow citizens. two republican administrations have betrayed the people's trust and have created suspicion and distrust of government through illegal and unconstitutional actions. we acknowledge that no political party, nor any president or vice president, possesses answers to all of the problems that face us as a nation, but neither do we concede that every human problem is beyond our control. we recognize further that the present distrust of government cannot be transformed easily into confidence. it is within our power to recapture, in this governing of this nation, the basic tenets of fairness, equality, opportunity and rule of law that motivated our revolutionary founders. we do pledge a government that has as its guiding concern, the needs and aspirations of all the people, rather than the perquisites and special privilege of the few. we do pledge a government that is not afraid to admit its mistakes. we do pledge a government that will be committed to a fairer distribution of wealth, income and power. we do pledge a government in which the new democratic president will work closely with the leaders of the congress on a regular, systematic basis so that the people can see the results of unity. we do pledge a government in which the democratic members in both houses of congress will seek a unity of purpose on the principles of the party. now, as we enter our 200th year as a nation, we as a party, with a sense of our own limitations, but also with a sense of our obligations, pledge a reaffirmation of this nation's founding principles. in this platform of the democratic party, we present a clear alternative to the failures of preceding administrations and a projection of the common future to which we aspire: a world at peace; a just society of equals; a society without violence; a society in consonance with its natural environment, affording freedom to the individual and the opportunity to develop to the fullest human potential. i. full employment, price stability and balanced growth the democratic party's concern for human dignity and freedom has been directed at increasing the economic opportunities for all our citizens and reducing the economic deprivation and inequities that have stained the record of american democracy. today, millions of people are unemployed. unemployment represents mental anxiety, fear of harassment over unpaid bills, idle hours, loss of self-esteem, strained family relationships, deprivation of children and youth, alcoholism, drug abuse and crime. a job is a key measure of a person's place in society - whether as a full-fledged participant or on the outside. jobs are the solution to poverty, hunger and other basic needs of workers and their families. jobs enable a person to translate legal rights of equality into reality. our industrial capacity is also wastefully underutilized. there are houses to build, urban centers to rebuild, roads and railroads to construct and repair, rivers to clean, and new sources of energy to develop. something is wrong when there is work to be done, and the people who are willing to do it are without jobs. what we have lacked is leadership. republican mismanagement during the past years, the american economy has suffered five major recessions, all under republican administrations. during the past eight years, we have had two costly recessions with continuing unprecedented peacetime inflation. ""stagflation"" has become a new word in our language just as it has become a product of republican economic policy. never before have we had soaring inflation in the midst of a major recession. stagnation, waste and human suffering are the legacy left to the american people by republican economic policies. during the past five years, u.s. economic growth has averaged only / per cent per year compared with an historical average of about per cent. because of this shortfall, the nation has lost some $-billion in the production of goods and services, and, if republican rule continues, we can expect to lose another $-$-billion by . ten million people are unemployed right now, and twenty to thirty million were jobless at some time in each of the last two years. for major groups in the labor force - minorities, women, youth, older workers, farm, factory and construction workers - unemployment has been, and remains, at depression levels. the rising cost of food, clothing, housing, energy and health care has eroded the income of the average american family, and has pushed persons on fixed incomes to the brink of economic disaster. since , the annual rate of inflation has averaged more than per cent and is projected by the ford administration to continue at an unprecedented peacetime rate of to per cent until . the depressed production and high unemployment rates of the nixon-ford administrations have produced federal deficits totalling $-billion. those who should be working and paying taxes are collecting unemployment compensation or other welfare payments in order to survive. for every one per cent increase in the unemployment rate - for every one million americans out of work - we all pay $-billion more in unemployment compensation and $-billion in welfare and related costs, and lose $-billion in taxes. in fiscal , $-billion was lost to the federal government through increased recession-related expenditures and lost revenues. in addition, state and local governments lost $-billion in revenues. a return to full employment will eliminate such deficits. with prudent management of existing programs, full employment revenues will permit the financing of national democratic initiatives. for millions of americans, the republican party has substituted welfare for work. huge sums will be spent on food stamps and medical care for families of the unemployed. social insurance costs are greatly increased. this year alone the federal government will spend nearly $-billion on unemployment compensation. in contrast, spending on job development is only $ /-billion. the goal of the new democratic administration will be to turn unemployment checks into pay checks. what democrats can achieve in contrast to the record of republican mismanagement, the most recent eight years of democratic leadership, under john f. kennedy and lyndon b. johnson, produced economic growth that was virtually uninterrupted. the unemployment rate dropped from . per cent in to . per cent in , and most segments of the population benefited. inflation increased at an average annual rate of only per cent, and the purchasing power of the average family steadily increased. in , about million people were living in poverty. over the next eight years, / million people moved out of poverty because of training opportunities, increased jobs and higher incomes. since , the number of persons living in poverty has remained virtually unchanged. we have met the goals of full employment with stable prices in the past and can do it again. the democratic party is committed to the right of all adult americans willing, able and seeking work to have opportunities for useful jobs at living wages. to make that commitment meaningful, we pledge ourselves to the support of legislation that will make every responsible effort to reduce adult unemployment to per cent within years. modernizing economic policy to meet our goals we must set annual targets for employment, production and price stability; the federal reserve must be made a full partner in national economic decisions and become responsive to the economic goals of congress and the president, credit must be generally available at reasonable interest rates; tax, spending and credit policies must be carefully coordinated with our economic goals, and coordinated within the framework of national economic planning. of special importance is the need for national economic planning capability. this planning capability should provide roles for congress and the executive as equal partners in the process and provide for full participation by the private sector, and state and local government. government must plan ahead just like any business, and this type of planning can be implemented without the creation of a new bureaucracy but rather through the well defined use of existing bodies and techniques. if we do not plan, but continue to react to crisis after crisis, our economic performance will be further eroded. full employment policies institutional reforms and the use of conventional tax, spending and credit policies must be accompanied by a broad range of carefully-targeted employment programs that will reduce unemployment in the private sector, and in regions, states and groups that have special employment problems. the lack of formal coordination among federal, state and local governments is a major obstacle to full employment. the absence of economic policy coordination is particularly visible during times of high unemployment. recessions reduce tax revenues, and increase unemployment-related expenditures for state and local governments. to maintain balanced budgets or reduce budget deficits these governments are forced to increase taxes and cut services-actions that directly undermine federal efforts to stimulate the economy. consistent and coherent economic policy requires federal anti-recession grant programs to state and local government, accompanied by public employment, public works projects and direct stimulus to the private sector. in each case, the programs should be phased in automatically when unemployment rises and phased out as it declines. even during periods of normal economic growth there are communities and regions of the country - particularly central cities and rural areas - that do not fully participate in national economic prosperity. the democratic party has supported national economic policies which have consciously sought to aid regions in the nation which have been afflicted with poverty, or newer regions which have needed resources for development. these policies were soundly conceived and have been successful. today, we have different areas and regions in economic decline and once again face a problem of balanced economic growth. to restore balance, national economic policy should be designed to target federal resources in areas of greatest need. to make low interest loans to businesses and state and local governments for the purpose of encouraging private sector investment in chronically depressed areas, we endorse consideration of programs such as a domestic development bank or federally insured taxable state and local bonds with adequate funding, proper management and public disclosure. special problems faced by young people, especially minorities, entering the labor force persist regardless of the state of the economy. to meet the needs of youth, we should consolidate existing youth employment programs; improve training, apprenticeship, internship and job-counseling programs at the high school and college levels; and permit youth participation in public employment projects. there are people who will be especially difficult to employ. special means for training and locating jobs for these people in the private sector, and, to the extent required, in public employment, should be established. every effort should be made to create jobs in the private sector. clearly, useful public jobs are far superior to welfare and unemployment payments. the federal government has the responsibility to ensure that all americans able, willing and seeking work are provided opportunities for useful jobs. equal employment opportunity we must be absolutely certain that no person is excluded from the fullest opportunity for economic and social participation in our society on the basis of sex, age, color religion or national origin. minority unemployment has historically been at least double the aggregate unemployment rate, with incomes at two-thirds the national average. special emphasis must be placed on closing this gap. accordingly, we reaffirm this party's commitment to full and vigorous enforcement of all equal opportunities laws and affirmative action. the principal agencies charged with anti-discrimination enforcement in jobs - the equal employment opportunity commission, the department of labor, and the justice department - are locked into such overlapping and uncoordinated strategies that a greatly improved government-wide system for the delivery of equal job and promotion opportunities must be developed and adequate funding committed to that end. new remedies to provide equal opportunities need exploration. anti-inflation policies the economic and social costs of inflation have been enormous. inflation is a tax that erodes the income of our workers, distorts business investment decisions, and redistributes income in favor of the rich americans on fixed incomes, such as the elderly, are often pushed into poverty by this cruel tax. the ford administration and its economic advisors have been consistently wrong about the sources and cures of the inflation that has plagued our nation and our people. fighting inflation by curtailing production and increasing unemployment has done nothing to restrain it. with the current high level of unemployment and low level of capacity utilization, we can increase production and employment without rekindling inflation. a comprehensive anti-inflation policy; must be established to assure relative price stability. such a program should emphasize increased production and productivity and should take other measures to enhance the stability and flexibility of our economy. the see-saw progress of our economy over the past eight years has disrupted economic growth. much of the instability has been created by stop-and-go monetary policies. high interest rates and the recurring underutilization of our manufacturing plant and equipment have retarded new investment. the high cost of credit has stifled small business and virtually halted the housing industry. unemployment in the construction industry has been raised to depression levels and home ownership has been priced beyond the reach of the majority of our people. stable economic growth with moderate interest rates will not only place downward pressure on prices through greater efficiency and productivity, but will reduce the prospects for future shortages of supply by increasing the production of essential goods and services and by providing a more predictable environment for business investment. the government must also work to improve the ability of our economy to respond to change competition in the private sector a reexamination, reform and consolidation of the existing regulatory structure. and promotion of a freer but fair system of international trade will aid in achieving that goal. at times. direct government involvement in wage and price decisions may be required to ensure price stability. but we do not believe that such involvement requires a comprehensive system of mandatory controls at this time. it will require that business and labor must meet fair standards of wage and price change. a strong domestic council on price and wage stability should he established with particular attention to restraining price increases in those sectors of our economy where prices are ""administered"" and where price competition does not exist. the federal government should hold public hearings. investigate and publish facts an price, profit, wage and interest rate increases that seriously threaten national price stability. such investigations and proper planning can focus public opinion and awareness on the direction of price, profit, wage and interest rate decisions. finally, tax policy should be used if necessary to maintain the real income of workers as was done with the tax cut. economic justice the democratic party has a long history of opposition to the undue concentration of wealth and economic power. it is estimated that about three-quarters of the country's total wealth is owned by one-fifth of the people. the rest of our population struggles to make ends meet in the face of rising prices and taxes. anti-trust enforcement the next democratic administration will commit itself to move vigorously against anti-competitive concentration of power within the business sector. this can he accomplished in part by strengthening the anti-trust laws and insuring adequate commitment and resources for the enforcement of these laws. but we must go beyond this negative remedy to a positive policy for encouraging the development of small business including the family farm. small businesses a healthy and growing small business community is a prerequisite for increasing competition and a thriving national economy while most people would accept this view, the federal government has in the past impeded the growth of small business. to alleviate the unfavorable conditions for small business, we must make every effort to assure the availability of loans to small business, including direct government loans at reasonable interest rates, particularly to those in greatest need, such as minority-owned businesses. for example, efforts should be made to strengthen minority business programs, and increase minority opportunities for business ownership. we support similar programs and opportunities for women. federal contract and procurement opportunities in such areas as housing, transportation and energy should support efforts to increase the volume of minority and small business involvement. regulatory agencies and the regulated small business must work together to see that federal regulations are met, without applying a stranglehold on the small firm or farm and with less paperwork and red tape. tax reform economic justice will also require a firm commitment to tax reform at all levels. in recent years there has been a shift in the tax burden from the rich to the working people of this country. the internal revenue code offers massive tax welfare to the wealthiest income groups in the population and only higher taxes for the average citizen. in , there were people with adjusted income of $. or more who still managed to pay no tax. most families pay between and per cent of their incomes in taxes. we have had endless talk about the need for tax reform and fairness in our federal tax system. it is now time for action. we pledge the democratic party to a complete overhaul of the present tax system, which will review all special tax provisions to ensure that they are justified and distributed equitably among our citizens. a responsible democratic tax reform program could save over $-billion in the first year with larger savings in the future. we will strengthen the internal revenue tax code so that high income citizens pay a reasonable tax on all economic income. we will reduce the use of unjustified tax shelters in such areas as oil and gas, taxloss farming, real estate, and movies. we will eliminate unnecessary and ineffective tax provisions to business and substituting effective incentives to encourage small business and capital formation in all businesses. our commitment to full employment and sustained purchasing power will also provide a strong incentive for capital formation. we will end abuses in the tax treatment of income from foreign sources; such as special tax treatment and incentives for multinational corporations that drain jobs and capital from the american economy. we will overhaul federal estate and gift taxes to provide an effective and equitable structure to promote tax justice and alleviate some of the legitimate problems faced by farmers, small business men and women and others who would otherwise be forced to liquidate assets in order to pay the tax. we will seek and eliminate provisions that encourage uneconomic corporate mergers and acquisitions. we will eliminate tax inequities that adversely affect individuals on the basis of sex or marital status. we will curb expense account deductions. and we will protect the rights of all taxpayers against oppressive procedures harassment and invasions of privacy by the internal revenue service. at present, many federal government tax and expenditure programs have a profound but unintended and undesirable impact on jobs and on where people and business locate. tax policies and other indirect subsidies have promoted deterioration of cities and regions. these policies should be reversed. there are other areas of taxation where change is also needed. the ford administration's unwise and unfair proposal to raise the regressive social security tax gives new urgency to the democratic party's goal of redistributing the burden of the social security tax by raising the wage base for earnings subject to the tax with effective exemptions and deductions to ease the impact on low income workers and two-earner families. further revision in the social security program will be required so that women are treated as individuals. the democratic party should make a reappraisal of the appropriate sources of federal revenues. the historical distribution of the tax burden between corporations and individuals, and among the various types of federal taxes, has changed dramatically in recent years. for example, the corporate tax share of federal revenue has declined from per cent in to per cent in . labor standards and rights the purpose of fair labor standards legislation has been the maintenance of the minimum standards necessary for the health, efficiency and general well-being of workers. recent inflation has eroded the real value of the current minimum wage. this rapid devaluation of basic income for working people makes a periodic review of the level of the minimum wage essential. such a review should insure that the minimum wage rate at least keep pace with the increase in the cost of living. raising the pay standard for overtime work, additional hiring of part-time persons and flexible work schedules will increase the independence of workers and create additional job opportunities, especially for women. we also support the principle of equal pay for comparable work. we are committed to full implementation and enforcement of the equal credit opportunity act. over a generation ago this nation established a labor policy whose purpose is to encourage the practice and procedure of collective bargaining and the right of workers to organize to obtain this goal. the democratic party is committed to extending the benefit of the policy to all workers and to removing the barriers to its administration. we support the right of public employees and agricultural workers to organize and bargain collectively. we urge the adoption of appropriate federal legislation to ensure this goal. we will seek to amend the fair labor standards act to speed up redress of grievances of workers asserting their legal rights. we will seek to enforce and, where necessary, to amend the national labor relations act to eliminate delays and inequities and to provide for more effective remedies and administration. we will support the full right of construction workers to picket a job site peacefully. we will seek repeal of section (b) of the taft-hartley act which allows states to legislate the anti-union open shop. we will maintain strong support for the process of voluntary arbitration, and we will enact minimum federal standards for workers compensation laws and for eligibility, benefit amounts, benefit duration and other essential features of the unemployment insurance program. unemployment insurance should cover all wage and salary workers. the occupational safety and health act of should cover all employees and be enforced as intended when the law was enacted. early and periodic review of its provisions should be made to insure that they are reasonable and workable. the democratic party will also seek to enact a comprehensive mine safety law, utilizing the most effective and independent enforcement by the federal government and support special legislation providing adequate compensation to coal miners and their dependents who have suffered disablement or death as a result of the black lung disease. we believe these policies will put america back to work, bring balanced growth to our economy and give all americans an opportunity to share in the expanding prosperity that will come from a new democratic administration. ii. government reform and business accountability the current republican administration did not invent inept government, but it has saddled the country with ineffective government; captive government, subservient to the special pleading of private economic interests; insensitive government, trampling over the rights of average citizens; and remote government, secretive and unresponsive. democrats believe that the cure for these ills is not the abandonment of governmental responsibility for addressing national problems, but the restoration of legitimate popular control over the organs and activities of government. there must be an ever-increasing accountability of government to the people. the democratic party is pledged to the fulfillment of four fundamental citizen rights of governance: the right to competent government; the right to responsive government; the right to integrity in government; the right to fair dealing by government . the right to competent government the democratic party is committed to the adoption of reforms such as zero-based budgeting, mandatory reorganization timetables, and sunset laws which do not jeopardize the implementation of basic human and political rights. these reforms are designed to terminate or merge existing agencies and programs, or to renew them only after assuring elimination of duplication, overlap, and conflicting programs and authorities, and the matching of funding levels to public needs. in addition, we seek flexibility to reflect changing public needs, the use of alternatives to regulation and the elimination of special interest favoritism and bias. to assure that government remains responsive to the people's elected representatives, the democratic party supports stepped-up congressional agency oversight and program evaluation, including full implementation of the congressional budget process; an expanded. more forceful role for the general accounting office in performing legislative audits for congress; and restraint by the president in exercising executive privilege designed to withhold necessary information from congress. the right to responsive government to begin to restore the shaken faith of americans that the government in washington is their government - responsive to their needs and desires, not the special interests of wealth, entrenched political influence, or bureaucratic self-interest - government decision-making must be opened up to citizen advocacy and participation. governmental decision-making behind closed doors is the natural enemy of the people. the democratic party is committed to openness throughout government: at regulatory commissions, advisory committee meetings and at hearings. public calendars of scheduled meetings between regulators and the regulated, and freedom of information policies, should be designed to facilitate rather than frustrate citizen access to documents and information. all persons and citizen groups must be given standing to challenge illegal or unconstitutional government action in court and to compel appropriate action. where a court or an agency finds evidence of government malfeasance or neglect those who brought forward such evidence should be compensated for their reasonable expenses in doing so. democrats have long sought - against fierce republican and big business opposition - the creation and maintenance of an independent consumer agency with the staff and power to intervene in regulatory matters on behalf of the consuming and using public. many states have already demonstrated that such independent public or consumer advocates can win important victories for the public interest in proceedings before state regulatory agencies and courts. this nation's civil service numbers countless strong and effective public servants. it was the resistance of earnest and steadfast federal workers that stemmed the nixon-ford efforts to undermine the integrity of the civil service. the reorganization of government which we envision will protect the job rights of civil servants and permit them to more effectively serve the public. the democratic party is committed to the review and overhaul of civil service laws to assure: insulation from political cronyism, accountability for nonfeasance as well as malfeasance, protection for the public servant who speaks out to identify corruption or failure, performance standards and incentives to reward efficiency and innovation and to assure non. discrimination and affirmative action in the recruitment, hiring and promotion of civil service employees. : we support the revision of the hatch act so as to extend to federal workers the same political rights enjoyed by other americans as a birthright, while still protecting the civil service from political abuse. the right to integrity in government the democratic party is pledged to the concept of full public disclosure by major public officials and urges appropriate legislation to effectuate this policy. we support divestiture of all financial holdings which directly conflict with official responsibilities and the development of uniform standards, review procedures and sanctions to identify and eliminate potential conflicts of interest. tough, competent regulatory commissioners with proven commitment to the public interest are urgently needed. we will seek restrictions on ""revolving door"" careerism - the shuttling back and forth of officials between jobs in regulatory or procurement agencies and in regulated industries and government contractors. all diplomats, federal judges and other major officials should be selected on a basis of qualifications. at all levels of government services, we will recruit, appoint and promote women and minorities. we support legislation to ensure that the activities of lobbyists be more thoroughly revealed both within the congress and the executive agencies. the democratic party has led the fight to take the presidency off the auction block by championing the public financing of presidential elections. the public has responded with enthusiastic use of the $ income tax checkoff. similar steps must now he taken for congressional candidates. we call for legislative action to provide for partial public financing on a matching basis of the congressional elections, and the exploration of further reforms to insure the integrity of the electoral process. the right to fair dealing by government a citizen has the right to expect fair treatment from government democrats are determined to find a means to make that right a reality. an office of citizen advocacy should be established as part of the executive branch independent of any agency, with full access to agency records and with both the power and the responsibility to investigate complaints. freedom of information requirements must he interpreted in keeping with the right at the individual to be free from anonymous accusation or slander. each citizen has the right to know and to review any information directly concerning him or her held by the government for any purpose whatsoever under the freedom of information act and the privacy act of , other than those exceptions set out in the freedom of information act. such information should be forthcoming promptly, without harassment and at a minimal cost to the citizen. appropriate remedies must be found for citizens who suffer hardship as the result of abuse of investigative or prosecutorial powers. business accountability the democratic party believes that competition is preferable to regulation and that government has a responsibility to seek the removal of unreasonable restraints and barriers to competition. to restore and. where necessary, to stimulate the operation of market forces. unnecessary regulations should he eliminated or revised. and the burden at excessive paperwork and red tape imposed on citizens and businesses should be removed. the democratic party encourages innovation and efficiency in the private sector. the democratic party also believes that strengthening consumer sovereignty - the ability of consumers to exercise free choice, to demand satisfaction, and to obtain direct redress of grievances - is similarly preferable to the present indirect government protection of consumers. however, government must not shark its responsibility to impose and rigorously enforce regulation where necessary to ensure health, safety and fairness. we reiterate our support for unflinching antitrust enforcement. and for the selection of an attorney general free of political obligation and committed to rigorous antitrust prosecution. we shall encourage consumer groups to establish and operate consumer cooperatives that will enable consumers to provide themselves marketplace alternatives and to provide a competitive spur to profit-oriented enterprises. we support responsible cost saving in the delivery of professional services including the use of low-cost paraprofessionals, efficient group practice and federal standards for state no-fault insurance programs. we reiterate our support for full funding of neighborhood legal services for the poor. the democratic party is also committed to strengthening the knowledge and bargaining power of consumers through government-supported systems for developing objective product performance standards; advertising and labeling requirements for the disclosure of essential consumer information; and efficient and low-cost redress of consumer complaints including strengthened small claims courts, informal dispute settlement mechanisms, and consumer class actions. the democratic party is committed to making the u.s. postal service function properly as an essential public service. we reaffirm the historic democratic commitment to assure the wholesomeness of consumer products such as food, chemicals, drugs and cosmetics, and the safety of automobiles, toys and appliances. regulations demanding safe performance can be developed in a way that minimizes their own costs and actually stimulates product innovation beneficial to consumers. iii. government and human needs the american people are demanding that their national government act more efficiently and effectively in those areas of urgent human needs such as welfare reform, health care and education. however, beyond these strong national initiatives, state and local governments must be given an increased, permanent role in administering social programs. the federal government's role should be the constructive one of establishing standards and goals with increased state and local participation. there is a need for a new blueprint for the public sector, one which identifies and responds to national problems, and recognizes the proper point of administration for both new and existing programs. in shifting administrative responsibility, such programs must meet minimum federal standards. government must concentrate, not scatter, its resources. it should not divide our people by inadequate and demeaning programs. the initiatives we propose do not require larger bureaucracy. they do require committed government. the democratic party realizes that accomplishing our goals in the areas of human needs will require time and resources. additional resources will become available as we implement our full-employment policies. federal revenues also grow over time. after full-employment has been achieved, $-billion of increased revenue will be generated by a fully operating economy each year. the program detailed in the areas of human needs cannot be accomplished immediately, but an orderly beginning can be made and the effort expanded as additional resources become available. health care in , national health expenditures averaged $ per person - an almost per cent increase in four years. inflation and recession have combined to erode the effectiveness of the medicare and medicaid programs . an increasingly high proportion of health costs have been shifted back to the elderly. an increasing republican emphasis on restricting eligibility and services is emasculating basic medical care for older citizens who cannot meet the rising costs of good health. we need a comprehensive national health insurance system with universal and mandatory coverage. such a national health insurance system should be financed by a combination of employer-employee shared payroll taxes and general tax revenues. consideration should be given to developing a means of support for national health insurance that taxes all forms of economic income. we must achieve all that is practical while we strive for what is ideal, taking intelligent steps to make adequate health services a right for all our people. as resources permit, this system should not discriminate against the mentally ill. maximum personal interrelationships between patients and their physicians should be preserved. we should experiment with new forms of medical care delivery to mold a national health policy that will meet our needs in a fiscally responsible manner. we must shift our emphasis in both private and public health care away from hospitalization and acute-care services to preventive medicine and the early detection of the major cripplers and killers of the american people. we further support increased federal aid to government laboratories as well as private institutions to seek the cure to heart disease, cancer, sickle cell anemia, paralysis from spinal cord injury, drug addiction and other such inflictions. national health insurance must also bring about a more responsive consumer oriented system of health care delivery. incentives must be used to increase the number of primary health care providers, and shift emphasis away from limited-application, technology- intensive programs. by reducing the barriers to primary preventive care, we can lower the need for costly hospitalization. communities must be encouraged to avoid duplication of expensive technologies and meet the genuine needs of their populations. the development of community health centers must be resumed. we must develop new health careers, and promote a better distribution of health care professionals, including the more efficient use of paramedics. all levels of government should concern themselves with increasing the number of doctors and paramedical personnel in the field of primary health care. a further need is the comprehensive treatment of mental illness, including the development of community mental health centers that provide comprehensive social services not only to alleviate, but to prevent mental stresses resulting from social isolation and economic dislocation. of particular importance is improved access to the health care system by underserved population groups. we must have national health insurance with strong built-in cost and quality controls. rates for institutional care and physicians' services should be set in advance, prospectively. alternative approaches to health care delivery, based on prepayment financing, should be encouraged and developed. americans are currently spending $-billion for health care - .% of our gross national product. a return to full employment and the maintenance thereafter of stable economic growth will permit the orderly and progressive development of a comprehensive national health insurance program which is federally financed. savings will result from the removal of inefficiency and waste in the current multiple public and private insurance programs and the structural integration of the delivery system to eliminate duplication and waste the cost of such a program need not exceed the share of the gnp this nation currently expends on health care; but the resulting improvement of health service would represent a major improvement in the quality of life enjoyed by americans at all economic levels. welfare reform fundamental welfare reform is necessary. the problems with our current chaotic and inequitable system of public assistance are notorious, existing welfare programs encourage family instability. they have few meaningful work incentives. they do little or nothing for the working poor on substandard incomes, the patchwork of federal, state and local programs encourages unfair variations in benefit levels among the states, and benefits in many states are well below the standards for even lowest-income budgets. of the current programs, only food stamps give universal coverage to all americans in financial need. cash assistance, housing aid and health care subsidies divide recipients into arbitrary categories. people with real needs who do not fit existing categories are ignored altogether. the current complexity of the welfare structure requires armies of bureaucrats at all levels of government. food stamps, aid to families with dependent children, and medicaid are burdened by unbelievably complex regulations, statutes and court orders. both the recipients of these benefits, and the citizen who pays for them, suffer as a result. the fact that our current system is administered and funded at different levels of government makes it difficult to take initiatives to improve the status of the poor. we should move toward replacement of our existing inadequate and wasteful system with a simplified system of income maintenance, substantially financed by the federal government, which includes a requirement that those able to work be provided with appropriate available jobs or job training opportunities. those persons who are physically able to work (other than mothers with dependent children) should be required to accept appropriate available jobs or job training. this maintenance system should embody certain basic principles. first and most important, it should provide an income floor both for the working poor and the poor not in the labor market. it must treat stable and broken families equally. it must incorporate a simple schedule of work incentives that guarantees equitable levels of assistance to the working poor. this reform may require an initial additional investment, but it offers the prospect of stabilization of welfare costs over the long run, and the assurance that the objectives of this expenditure will be accomplished. as an interim step, and as a means of providing immediate federal fiscal relief to state and local governments, local governments should no longer be required to bear the burden of welfare costs. further, there should be a phased reduction in the states' share of welfare costs. civil and political rights to achieve a just and healthy society and enhance respect and trust in our institutions, we must insure that all citizens are treated equally before the law and given the opportunity, regardless of race, color, sex, religion, age, language or national origin, to participate fully in the economic, social and political processes and to vindicate their legal and constitutional rights. in reaffirmation of this principle, an historic commitment of the democratic party, we pledge vigorous federal programs and policies of compensatory opportunity to remedy for many americans the generations of injustice and deprivation; and full funding of programs to secure the implementation and enforcement of civil rights. we seek ratification of the equal rights amendment, to insure that sex discrimination in all its forms will be ended, implementation of title ix, and elimination of discrimination against women in all federal programs. we support the right of all americans to vote for president no matter where they live; vigorous enforcement of voting rights legislation to assure the constitutional rights of minority and language-minority citizens; the passage of legislation providing for registration by mail in federal elections to erase existing barriers to voter participation; and full home rule for the district of columbia, including authority over its budget and local revenues, elimination of federal restrictions in matters which are purely local and voting representation in the congress, and the declaration of the birthday of the great civil rights leader, martin luther king jr., as a national holiday. we pledge effective and vigorous action to protect citizens privacy from bureaucratic and technological intrusions such as wiretapping and bugging without judicial scrutiny and supervision; and a full and complete pardon for those who are in legal or financial jeopardy because of their peaceful opposition to the vietnam war, with deserters to be considered on a case-by-case basis. we fully recognize the religious and ethical nature of the concerns which many americans have on the subject of abortion. we feel, however, that it is undesirable to attempt to amend the u.s. constitution to overturn the supreme court decision in this area. the democratic party reaffirms and strengthens its legal and moral trust responsibilities to the american indian. we believe it is honorable to obey and implement our treaty obligations to the first americans. in discharging our duty, we shall exert all and necessary assistance to afford the american indians the protection of their land, their water and their civil rights. federal laws relating to american indians and the functions and purposes of the bureau of indian affairs should be re-examined. we support a provision in the immigration laws to facilitate acquisition of citizenship by resident aliens. we are committed to puerto rico's right to enjoy full self-determination and a relationship that can evolve in ways that will most benefit u.s. citizens in puerto rico. the democratic party respects and supports the present desire of the people of puerto rico to freely associate in permanent union with the united states, as an autonomous commonwealth or as a state. education the goal of our educational policy is to provide our citizens with the knowledge and skills they need to live successfully. in pursuing this goal, we will seek adequate funding, implementation and enforcement of requirements in the education programs already approved by congress. we should strengthen federal support of existing programs that stress improvement of reading and math skills. title i of the elementary and secondary education act must reach those it is intended to benefit to effectively increase these primary skills ""break-throughs"" in compensatory education require a concentration of resources by each individual child and a mix of home and school activities that is not possible with the underfunded republican programs. compensatory education is realistic only when there is a stable sequence of funding that allows proper planning and continuity of programs, an impossibility under republican veto and impoundment politics. we should also work to expand federal support in areas of educational need that have not yet been addressed sufficiently by the public schools - education of the handicapped, bilingual education and vocational education, and early childhood education. we propose federally financed, family-centered developmental and educational child care programs - operated by the public schools or other local organizations, including both private and community - and that they be available to all who need and desire them. we support efforts to provide for the basic nutritional needs of students. we recognize the right of all citizens to education pursuant to title vi of the civil rights act of , and the need in affected communities for bilingual and bicultural educational programs. we call for compliance with civil rights requirements in hiring and promotion in school systems. for the disadvantaged child, equal opportunity requires concentrated spending. and for all children, we must guarantee that jurisdictions of differing financial capacity can spend equal amounts on education. these goals do not conflict but complement each other. the principle that a child's education should depend on the property wealth of his or her school jurisdiction has been discredited in the last few years. with increased federal funds, it is possible to enhance educational opportunity by eliminating spending disparities within state borders. state-based equalizations, even state takeover of education costs, to relieve the overburdened property taxpayer and to avoid the inequities in the existing finance system, should be encouraged. the essential purpose of school desegregation is to give all children the same educational opportunities. mite will continue to support that goal. the supreme court decision of and the aftermath were based on the recognition that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal, it is clearly our responsibility as a party and as citizens to support the principles of our constitution. the democratic party pledges its concerted help through special consultation, matching funds incentive grants and other mechanisms to communities which seek education integrated both in terms of race and economic class, through equitable, reasonable and constitutional arrangements. mandatory transportation of students beyond their neighborhoods for the purpose of desegregation remains a judicial tool of last resort for the purpose of achieving school desegregation. the democratic party will be an active ally of those communities which seek to enhance the quality as well as the integration of educational opportunities. we encourage a variety of other measures including the redrawing of attendance lines, pairing of schools, use of the ""magnet school"" concept, strong fair housing enforcement, and other techniques for the achievement of racial and economic integration . the party reaffirms its support of public school education. the party also renews its commitment to the support of a constitutionally acceptable method of providing tax aid for the education of all pupils in non-segregated schools in order to insure parental freedom in choosing the best education for their children. specifically, the party will continue to advocate constitutionally permissible federal education legislation which provides for the equitable participation in federal programs of all low and moderate income pupils attending all the nation's schools. the party commits itself to support of adult education and training which will provide skills upgrading. in higher education, our party is strongly committed to extending post-secondary opportunities for students from low and middle-income families, including older students and students who can attend only part-time. the basic educational opportunity grants should be funded at the full payment schedule, and campus-based programs of aid must be supported to provide a reasonable choice of institutions as well as access. with a coordinated and reliable system of grants, loans and work study, we can relieve the crisis in costs that could shut all but the affluent out of our colleges and universities. the federal government and the states must develop strategies to support institutions of higher education from both public and private sources. the federal government should directly provide cost of education payments to all higher education institutions, including predominantly black colleges, to help cover per-student costs which far exceed those covered by tuition and fees. finally, government must systematically support basic and applied research in the liberal arts, the sciences, education and the professions - without political interference or bureaucratic restraint. the federal investment in graduate education should be sustained and selectively increased to meet the need for highly trained individuals. trainee-ships and fellowships should be provided to attract the most talented students, especially among minority groups and women . libraries should receive continuous and guaranteed support and the presently impounded funds for nationwide library planning and development should be released immediately. social services the nixon-ford administration would limit eligibility for federally-subsidized social services to the very poor. social services can make significant changes in the lives of the non-poor, as well. the problems of alcoholism, drug abuse, mental retardation, child abuse or neglect, and mental illness arise at every income level, and quality day-care has become increasingly urgent for low- and middle-income families. federal grants to the states should support a broad community-based program of social services to low- and middle-income families, to assure that these programs reach their intended populations. the states are now being required to take over an increasing share of existing social service programs. in , the ceiling for federal social service grants was frozen at $.-billion, and subsequent inflation of per cent has reduced the effective federal aid to existing programs. while there must certainly be a ceiling on such grants it should be raised to compensate for inflation and to encourage states and localities to expand social services to low- and moderate-income families. disabled citizens we support greater recognition of the problems of the disabled and legislation assuring that all people with disabilities have reasonable access to all public accommodations and facilities. the democratic party supports affirmative action goals for employment of the disabled. older citizens the democratic party has always emphasized that adequate income and health care for senior citizens are basic federal government responsibilities. the recent failure of government to reduce unemployment and alleviate the impact of the rising costs of food, housing and energy have placed a heavy burden on those who live on fixed and limited incomes, especially the elderly. our other platform proposals in these areas are designed to help achieve an adequate income level for the elderly. we will not permit an erosion of social security benefits, and while our ultimate goal is a health security system ensuring comprehensive and quality care for all americans, health costs paid by senior citizens under the present system must be reduced. we believe that medicare should be made available to americans abroad who are eligible for social security. democrats strongly support employment programs and the liberalization of the allowable earnings limitation under social security for older americans who wish to continue working and living as productive citizens. we will put an end to delay in implementation of nutrition programs for the elderly and give high priority to a transportation policy for senior citizens under the older americans act. we pledge to enforce vigorously health and safety standards for nursing homes, and seek alternatives which allow senior citizens where possible to remain in their own homes. veterans america's veterans have been rhetorically praised by the nixon-ford administration at the same time that they have been denied adequate medical, education, pension and employment benefits. vietnam veterans have borne the brunt of unemployment and economic mismanagement at home. as late as december , the unemployment rate for vietnam veterans was over per cent. younger vietnam veterans (ages -) have had unemployment rates almost twice the rate of similarly-aged non-veterans. job training, placement, and information and counseling programs for veterans are inadequate. the veterans administration health care program requires adequate funding and improved management and health care delivery in order to provide high quality service and effectively meet the changing needs of the patient population. the next democratic administration must act to rescue pensioner veterans below the poverty line. thirty per cent of the veterans and per cent of the widows receiving pensions have total incomes below the poverty line. cost of living increases should be automatic in the veterans' pension and disability system. educational assistance should be expanded two years for those veterans already enrolled and drawing benefits in va-approved educational and training programs . the arts and humanities we recognize the essential role played by the arts and humanities in the development of america. our nation cannot afford to be materially rich and spiritually poor. we endorse a strong role for the federal government in reinforcing the vitality and improving the economic strength of the nation's artists and arts institutions, while recognizing that artists must be absolutely free of any government control. we would support the growth and development of the national endowments for the arts and humanities through adequate funding, the development of special anti-recession employment programs for artists, copyright reforms to protect the rights of authors, artists and performers, and revision of the tax laws that unfairly penalize artists. we further pledge our support for the concept and adequate financing of public broadcasting. iv. states, counties and cities more than eight years ago, the werner commission on civil disorders concluded that the disorders of the 1960s were caused by the deteriorating conditions of life in our urban centers - abject poverty, widespread unemployment, uninhabitable housing, declining services, rampant crime and disintegrating families. many of these same problems plagued rural america as well. little has been done by the republican administrations to deal with these fundamental challenges to our society. this policy of neglect gives the lie to the current administration's rhetorical commitment to state and local governments. by tolerating intolerable unemployment, by vetoing programs for the poor, the old, and the ill, by abandoning the veterans and the young, and by withholding necessary funds for the decaying cities, the nixon-ford years have been years of retrogression in the nation's efforts to meet the needs of our cities. by abdicating responsibility for meeting these needs at the national level, the current administration has placed impossible burdens on fiscally hard-pressed state and local governments. in turn, local governments have been forced to rely excessively on the steadily diminishing and regressive property tax - which was originally designed to cover property related services and was never intended to support the services now required in many of our cities and towns. federal policies and programs have inadvertently exacerbated the urban crisis. within the framework of a new partnership of federal, state and local governments, and the private sector, the democratic party is pledged to the development of america's first national urban policy. central to the success of that policy are the democratic party's commitments to full employment, incentives for urban and rural economic development, welfare reform, adequate health care, equalization of education expenditures, energy conservation and environmental quality. if progress were made in these areas, much of the inappropriately placed fiscal burden would be removed, and local governments could better fulfill their appropriate responsibilities. to assist further in relieving both the fiscal and service delivery problems of states and local governments, the democratic party reaffirms its support for general revenue sharing as a base for the fiscal health of all levels of government, acknowledging that the civil rights and citizens' participation provisions must be strengthened. we further believe that there must be an increase in the annual funding to compensate for the erosion of inflation. we believe the distribution formula should be adjusted to reflect better community and state needs, poverty levels, and tax effort. finally, to alleviate the financial burden placed on our cities by the combination of inflation and recession, the democratic party restates its support for an emergency anti-recession aid to states and cities particularly hard hit by recession. housing and community development in the past eight republican years, housing has become a necessity priced as a luxury. housing prices have nearly doubled in the past six years and housing starts have dropped by almost one-quarter the effect is that over three-fourths of american families cannot afford to buy an average-priced home. the basic national goal of providing decent housing and available shelter has been sacrificed to misguided tax, spending and credit policies which were supposed to achieve price stability but have failed to meet that goal. as a result, we do not have decent housing or price stability. the vision of the housing act of , the result of three decades of enlightened democratic housing policy, has been lost. the democratic party reasserts these goals and pledges to achieve them. the democratic party believes it is time for a housing and urban develop policy which recognizes the needs and difficulties of both the buying and renting public and the housing industry. we support a revitalized housing program which will be able to meet the public's need for housing at reasonable cost and the industry's need for relief from years of stagnation and now-chronic unemployment. we support direct federal subsidies and low interest loans to encourage the construction of low and moderate income housing. such subsidies shall not result in unreasonable profit for builders, developers or credit institutions. we support the expansion of the highly successful programs of direct federal subsidies to provide housing for the elderly. we call for greatly increased emphasis on the rehabilitation of existing housing to rebuild our neighborhoods - a priority which is undercut by the current pattern of federal housing money which includes actual prohibitions to the use of funds for rehabilitation. we encourage public and private commitments to the preservation and renovation of our country's historic landmarks so that they can continue as a vital part of our commercial and residential architectural heritage. we will work to assure that credit institutions make greater efforts to direct mortgage money into the financing of private housing. we will take all necessary steps to prohibit the practice of red-lining by private financial institutions, the fha, and the secondary mortgage market which have had the effect of depriving certain areas of the necessary mortgage funds which they need to upgrade themselves. we will further encourage an increase in loans and subsidies for housing and rehabilitation, especially in poverty stricken areas. we support greater flexibility in the use of community development block grants at the local level. the current housing and community development act should be reformed and. restructured so that its allocation, monitoring, and citizen participation features better address the needs of local communities, major cities and underdeveloped rural areas. the revitalization of our cities must proceed with an understanding that housing, jobs and related community facilities are all critical to a successful program. the democratic party will create the necessary incentives to insure that private and public jobs are available to meet the employment needs of these communities and pledges a more careful planning process for the location of the federal government's own employment-creation facilities. the democratic party proposes a revitalization of the federal housing administration as a potent institution to stabilize new construction and existing housing markets. to this end, the agency's policies must be simplified, its operating practices and insurance rate structures modernized and the sense of public service which was the hallmark of the fha for so many years must be restored, in addition, we propose automatic triggering of direct production subsidies and a steady flow of mortgage funds during periods when housing starts fall below acceptable levels. women, the elderly, single persons and minorities are still excluded from exercising their right to select shelter in the areas of their choice, and many ""high-risk"" communities are systematically denied access to the capital they require. the democratic party pledges itself to the aggressive enforcement of the fair housing act to the promotion and enforcement of equal opportunity in housing; and to the pursuit of new regulatory and incentive policies aimed at providing minority groups and women with equal access to mortgage credit. in addition to direct attacks upon such known violations of the law, a comprehensive approach to these problems must include policies aimed at the underlying causes of unequal credit allocations. the democratic party pledges itself to aggressive policies designed to assure lenders that their commitments will be backed by government resources, so that investment risks will be shared by the public and private sectors. the special needs of older cities the democratic party recognizes that a number of major, older cities - including the nation's largest city - have been forced to undertake even greater social responsibilities, which have resulted in unprecedented fiscal crises. there is a national interest in helping such cities in their present travail, and a new democratic president and the congress shall undertake a massive effort to do so. law enforcement and law observance the total crime bill in the united states has been estimated at $-billion a year, almost as much as the cost of our national defense. but over and above the economic impact, the raging and unchecked growth of crime seriously impairs the confidence of many of our citizens in their ability to walk on safe streets, to live securely in peaceful and happy homes, and to work safely in their places of business. fear mounts along with the crime rate. homes are made into fortresses. in large sections of every major city, people are afraid to go out at night. outside big cities, the crime rate is growing even faster, so that suburbs, small towns and rural areas are no longer secure havens. defaulting on their ""law and order"" promises, the republicans in the last eight years have let the rising tide of crime soil the highest levels of government, allowed the crime rate to skyrocket and failed to reform the criminal justice system. recognizing that law enforcement is essentially a local responsibility, we declare that control of crime is an urgent national priority and pledge the efforts of the democratic party to insure that the federal government act effectively to reverse these trends and to be an effective partner to the cities and states in a well-coordinated war on crime. we must restore confidence in the criminal justice system by insuring that detection, conviction and punishment of lawbreakers is swift and sure; that the criminal justice system is just and efficient that jobs, decent housing and educational opportunities provide a real alternative to crime to those who suffer enforced poverty and injustice. we pledge equally vigorous prosecution and punishment for corporate crime, consumer fraud and deception; programs to combat child abuse and crimes against the elderly; criminal laws that reflect national needs; application of the law with a balanced and fair hand; a judiciary that renders equal justice for all; criminal sentences that provide punishment that actually punishes and rehabilitation that actually rehabilitates; and a correctional system emphasizing effective job training, educational and post-release programs. only such measures will restore the faith of the citizens in our criminal justice system. toward these ends, we support a major reform of the criminal justice system, but we oppose any legislative effort to introduce repressive and anti-civil libertarian measures in the guise of reform of the criminal code. the law enforcement assistance administration has not done its job adequately. federal funding for crime-fighting must be wholly revamped to more efficiently assist local and state governments in strengthening their law enforcement and criminal justice systems, rather than spend money on the purchase of expensive equipment, much of it useless. citizen confidence in law enforcement can be enhanced through increased citizen participation, by informing citizens of police and prosecutor policies, assuring that police departments reflect a cross-section of the communities they serve, establishing neighborhood forums to settle simple disputes, restoring the grand jury to fair and vigorous independence, establishing adequate victim compensation programs, and reaffirming our respect for the individual's right to privacy. coordinated action is necessary to end the vicious cycle of drug addiction and crime. we must break up organized crime syndicates dealing in drugs, take necessary action to get drug pushers off the streets, provide drug users with effective rehabilitation programs, including medical assistance, ensure that all young people are aware of the costs of a life of drug dependency, and use worldwide efforts to stop international production and trafficking in illicit drugs . a democratic congress in passed the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act to come to grips with the fact that juveniles account for almost half of the serious crimes in the united states, and to remedy the fact that federal programs thus far have not met the crisis of juvenile delinquency. we pledge funding and implementation of this act, which has been ignored by the republican administration. handguns simplify and intensify violent crime. ways must be found to curtail the availability of these weapons. the democratic party must provide the leadership for a coordinated federal and state effort to strengthen the presently inadequate controls over the manufacture, assembly, distribution and possession of handguns and to ban saturday night specials. furthermore, since people and not guns commit crimes, we support mandatory sentencing for individuals convicted of committing a felony with a gun. the democratic party, however, affirms the right of sportsmen to possess guns for purely hunting and target-shooting purposes. the full implementation of these policies will not in themselves stop lawlessness. to insure professionally trained and equitably rewarded police forces, law enforcement officers must be properly recruited and trained, and provided with decent wages, working conditions, support staff, and federal death benefits for those killed in line of duty. effective police forces cannot operate without just and speedy court systems. we must reform bail and pre-trial detention procedures. we must assure speedy trials and ease court congestion by increasing the number of judges, prosecutors and public defenders. we must improve and streamline courthouse management procedures, require criminal justice records to be accurate and responsible, and establish fair and more uniform sentencing for crimes. courts should give priority to crimes which are serious enough to deserve imprisonment. law enforcement should emphasize the prosecution of crimes against persons and property as a higher priority than victimless crimes. current rape laws need to be amended to abolish archaic evidence rules that discriminate against rape victims. we pledge that the democratic party will not tolerate abuses of governmental processes and unconstitutional action by the government itself. recognizing the value of legitimate intelligence efforts to combat espionage and major crime, we call for new legislation to ensure that these efforts will no longer be used as an excuse for abuses such as bugging, wiretaps, mail opening and disruption aimed at lawful political and private activities. the attorney general in the next democratic administration will be an independent, non-political official of the highest integrity. if lawlessness is found at any level, in any branch, immediate and decisive action will be taken to root it out. to that end, we will establish the machinery for appointing an independent special prosecutor whenever needed. as a party, as a nation, we must commit ourselves to the elimination of injustice wherever it plagues our government, our people and our future. transportation an effective national transportation policy must be grounded in an understanding of all transportation systems and their consequences for costs, reliability, safety, environmental quality and energy savings. without public transportation, the rights of all citizens to jobs and social services cannot be met. to that end, we will work to expand substantially the discretion available to states and cities in the use of federal transportation money, for either operating expenses or capital programs on the modes of transportation which they choose. a greater share of highway trust fund money should also be available on a flexible basis. we will change further the current restrictive limits on the use of mass transit funds by urban and rural localities so that greater amounts can be used as operating subsidies; we emphatically oppose the republican administration's efforts to reduce federal operating subsidies. we are committed to dealing with the transportation needs of rural america by upgrading secondary roads and bridges and by completion of the original plan of for the interstate highway system where it benefits rural americans. among other benefits, these measures would help overcome the problems of getting products to market, and services to isolated persons in need. we will take whatever action is necessary to reorganize and revitalize our nation's railroads. we are also committed to the support of healthy trucking and bus, inland waterway and air transport systems. a program of national rail and road rehabilitation and improved mass transit would not only mean better transportation for our people, but it would also put thousands of unemployed construction workers back to work and make them productive tax-paying citizens once again. further, it would move toward the democratic party's goal of assuring balanced transportation services for all areas of the nation-urban and rural. such a policy is intended to reorganize both pressing urban needs and the sorry state of rural public transportation. rural development the problems of rural america are closely linked to those of our cities. rural poor and the rural elderly suffer under the same economic pressures and have at least as many social needs as their counterparts in the cities. the absence of rural jobs and rural vitality and the continuing demise of the family farm have prompted a migration to our cities which is beyond the capacity of the cities to absorb. over million americans moved to urban areas between and alone. we pledge to develop programs to make the family farm economically healthy again so as to be attractive to young people. to that end, the democratic party pledges to strengthen the economy and thereby create jobs in our great agricultural and rural areas by the full implementation and funding of the rural development act of and by the adoption of an agricultural policy which recognizes that our capacity to produce food and fiber is one of our greatest assets. while it is bad enough to be poor, or old, or alone in the city, it is worse in the country, we are therefore committed to overcome the problems of rural as well as urban isolation and poverty by insuring the existence of adequate health facilities, critically-needed community facilities such as water supply and sewage disposal systems, decent housing, adequate educational opportunity and needed transportation throughout rural america. as discussed in the transportation section, we believe that transportation dollars should be available in a manner to permit their flexible use. in rural areas this means they could be used for such needs as secondary road improvement, taxi systems, buses, or other systems to overcome the problems of widely dispersed populations, to facilitate provisions of social services and to assure access of citizens to meet human needs. two thousand family farms are lost per week. to help assure that family farms stay in the family where they belong, we will push increases in relevant estate tax exemptions. this increased exemption, when coupled with programs to increase generally the vitality of rural america, should mean that the demise of the family farm can be reversed. we will seek adequate levels of insured and guaranteed loans for electrification and telephone facilities. only such a coordinated program can make rural america again attractive and vigorous, as it needs to be if we are to deal with the challenges facing the nation as a whole. administration of federal aid federal aid programs impose jurisdictional and administrative complications which substantially diminish the good accomplished by the federal expenditure of about $-billion annually on state and local governments. an uncoordinated policy regarding eligibility requirements, audit guidelines, accounting procedures and the like compromise the over categorical aid programs and threaten to bog down the more broadly conceived flexible block grant programs. the democratic party is committed to cutting through this chaos and simplifying the grant process for both recipient governments and program administrators. the democratic party also reaffirms the role of state and general purpose local governments as the principal governments in the orderly administration of federal aide and revenue sharing programs. v. natural resources and environmental quality energy almost three years have passed since the oil embargo. yet, by any measure, the nation's energy lifeline is in far greater peril today. america is running out of energy - natural gas, gasoline and oil. the economy is already being stifled. the resulting threat of unemployment and diminished production is already present. if america, as we know it, is to survive, we must move quickly to develop renewable sources of energy. the democratic party will strive to replace the rapidly diminishing supply of petroleum and natural gas with solar, geothermal, wind, tide and other forms of energy, and we recommend that the federal government promptly expand whatever funds are required to develop new systems of energy. we have grown increasingly dependent on imported oil. domestic production, despite massive price increases, continues to decline. energy stockpiles, while authorized, are yet to be created. we have no agreements with any producing nations for security of supply. efforts to develop alternative energy sources have moved forward slowly. production of our most, available and plentiful alternative - coal - is not increasing. energy conservation is still a slogan, instead of a program. republican energy policy has failed because it is based on illusions; the illusion of a free market in energy that does not exist, the illusion that ever-increasing energy prices will not harm the economy, and the illusion of an energy program based on unobtainable independence. the time has come to deal with the realities of the energy crisis, not its illusions. the realities are that rising energy prices, falling domestic supply, increasing demand, and the threat to national security of growing imports, have not been contained by the private sector. the democratic energy platform begins with a recognition that the federal government has an important role to play in insuring the nation's energy future, and that it must be given the tools it needs to protect the economy and the nation's consumers from arbitrary and excessive energy price increases and help the nation embark on a massive domestic energy program focusing on conservation, coal conversion, exploration and development of new technologies to insure an adequate short-term and long-term supply of energy for the nation's needs. a nation advanced enough and wealthy enough to send a man to the moon must dedicate itself to developing alternate sources of energy. energy pricing enactment of the energy policy and conservation act of established oil ceiling prices at levels sufficient to maximize domestic production but still below opec equivalents. the act was a direct result of the democratic congress commitment to the principle that beyond certain levels. increasing energy prices simply produce high-cost energy - without producing any additional energy supplies. this oil-pricing lesson should also be applied to natural gas. those not pressing to turn natural gas price regulation over to opec, while arguing the rhetoric of so-called deregulation, must not prevail. the pricing of new natural gas is in need of reform. we should narrow the gap between oil and natural gas prices with new natural gas ceiling prices that maximize production and investment while protecting the economy and the consumer. any reforms in the pricing of new natural gas should not be at the cost of severe economic dislocations that would accelerate inflation and increase unemployment . an examination must be made of advertising cost policies of utilities and the imposition of these costs on the consumer. advertising costs used to influence public policy ought to be borne by stockholders of the utility companies and not by the consumers. domestic supply and demand the most promising neglected domestic option for helping balance our energy budget is energy conservation. but major investments in conservation are still not being made. the democratic party will support legislation to establish national building performance standards on a regional basis designed to improve energy efficiency. we will provide new incentives for aiding individual homeowners, particularly average income families and the poor in undertaking conservation investments. we will support the reform of utility rate structures and regulatory rules to encourage conservation and ease the utility rate burden on residential users, farmers and other consumers who can least afford it; make more efficient use of electrical generating capacity, and we will aggressively pursue implementation of automobile efficiency standards and appliance labeling programs already established by democratic initiative in the energy policy and conservation act. coal currently comprises per cent of the nations energy resources, but produces only per cent of the nation's energy. the democratic party believes that the united states' coal production can and must be increased without endangering the health and safety of miners, diminishing the land and water resources necessary for increased food production, and sacrificing the personal and property rights of farmers, ranchers and indian tribes. we must encourage the production of the highest quality coal, closest to consuming markets, in order to insure that investments in energy production reinforce the economics of energy producing and consuming regions. improved rail transportation systems will make coal available where it is actually needed, and will insure a rail transport network required for a healthy industrial and agricultural economy. we support an active federal role in the research and development of clean burning and commercially competitive coal burning systems and technologies, and we encourage the conversion to coal of industrial users of natural gas and imported oil. air quality standards that make possible the burning of coal without danger to the public health or degradation of the nation's clear air must be developed and implemented. the democratic party wants to put an end to the economic depression, loss of life and environmental destruction that has long accompanied irresponsible coal development in appalachia. strip mining legislation designed to protect and restore the environment, while ending the uncertainty over the rules governing future coal mining, must be enacted. the huge reserves of oil, gas and coal on federal territory, including the outer continental shelf, belong to all the people. the republicans have pursued leasing policies which give the public treasury the least benefit and the energy industry the most benefit from these public resources. consistent with environmentally sound practices, new leasing procedures must be adopted to correct these policies, as well as insure the timely development of existing leases. major federal initiatives, including major governmental participation in early high-risk development projects, are required if we are to harness renewable resources like solar, wind, geothermal, the oceans, and other new technologies such as fusion, fuel cells and the conservation of solid waste and starches into energy. the ford administration has failed to provide those initiatives, and, in the process, has denied american workers important new opportunities for employment in the building and servicing of emerging new energy industries. u.s. dependence on nuclear power should be kept to the minimum necessary to meet our needs. we should apply stronger safety standards as we regulate its use. and we must be honest with our people concerning its problems and dangers as well as its benefits. an increasing share of the nuclear research dollar must be invested in finding better solutions to the problems of nuclear waste disposal, reactor safety and nuclear safeguards - both domestically and internationally . competition in the domestic petroleum industry legislation must be enacted to insure energy administrators and legislators access to information they need for making the kind of informed decisions that future energy policy will require. we believe full disclosure of data on reserves, supplies and costs of production should be mandated by law it is increasingly clear that there is no free, competitive market for crude oil in the united states. instead, through their control of the nation's oil pipelines, refineries and marketing, the major oil producers have the capability of controlling the field and often the downstream price of almost all oil. when competition inadequate to insure free markets and maximum benefit to american consumers exists, we support effective restrictions on the right of major companies to own all phases of the oil industry. we also support the legal prohibition against corporate ownership of competing types of energy, such as oil and coal. we believe such ""horizontal"" concentration of economic power to be dangerous both to the national interest and to the functioning of the competitive system. improved energy planning establishment of a more orderly system for setting energy goals and developing programs for reaching those goals should be undertaken. the current proliferation of energy jurisdictions among many executive agencies underscores the need for a more coordinated system. such a system should be undertaken, and provide for centralization of overall energy planning in a specific executive agency and an assessment of the capital needs for all priority programs to increase production and conservation of energy. mineral resources as with energy resources, many essential mineral resources may soon be inadequate to meet our growing needs unless we plan more wisely than we have with respect to energy. the democratic party pledges to undertake a long-range assessment of supply of our mineral reserves as well as the demand for them. agriculture as a nation, we are blessed with rich resources of land, water and climate. when the supporting technology has been used to preserve and promote the family ownership and operation of farms and ranches, the people have been well served. america's farm families have demonstrated their ability and eagerness to produce food in sufficient quantity to feed their fellow citizens and share with hungry people around the world as well. yet this national asset has been neither prudently developed nor intelligently used. the eight-year record of the nixon-ford administration is a record of lost opportunities, failure to meet the challenges of agricultural statesmanship, and favoritism to the special pleading of giant corporate agricultural interests. republican misrule in agriculture has caused wide fluctuations in prices to producers, inflated food prices to consumers, unconscionable profiteering on food by business, unscrupulous shipping practices by grain traders, and the mishandling of our abundance in export markets. republican agricultural policy has spelled high food prices, unstable farm income, windfalls for commodity speculators and multinational corporations, and confrontations between farmer and consumer. foremost attention must be directed to the establishment of a national food and fiber policy which will be fair to both producer and consumer, and be based on the family farm agricultural system which has served the nation and the world so well for so long. maximum agricultural production will be the most effective means of achieving an adequate food and fiber supply and reasonable price stability to american consumers. without parity income assurance to farmers, full production cannot be achieved in an uncertain economy. we must assure parity returns to farmers based on costs of production plus a reasonable profit. we must continue and intensify efforts to expand agriculture's long-term markets abroad, and at the same time we must prevent irresponsible and inflationary sales from the american granary to foreign purchasers. aggressive but stable and consistent export policy must be our goal. the production of food and fiber in america must be used as part of a constructive foreign policy based on long-term benefits at home and abroad, but not at the expense of the farmers. producers shall be encouraged to produce at full capacity within the limits of good conservation practices, including the use of recycled materials, if possible and desirable, to restore natural soil fertility. any surplus production needed to protect the people of the world from famine shall be stored on the farm in such a manner as to isolate it from the market place. excess production beyond the needs of the people for food shall be converted to industrial purposes. farmers as individual producers must deal constantly with organized suppliers and marketers, and compete with non-farm conglomerates. to assist them in bargaining for the tools of production, and to strengthen the institution of the family farm, the democratic party will: support the capper-volstead act in its present form; curb the influence of non-farm conglomerates which, through the elimination of competition in the marketplace, pose a threat to farmers; support the farmer cooperatives and bargaining associations; scrutinize and remedy any illegal concentrations and price manipulations of farm equipment and supply industries; revitalize basic credit programs for farmers; provide adequate credit tailored to the needs of young farmers; assure access for farmers and rural residents to energy, transportation, electricity and telephone services; reinstate sound, locally administered soil conservation programs; eliminate tax shelter farming; and overhaul federal estate and gift taxes to alleviate some of the legal problems faced by farm families who would otherwise be forced to liquidate their assets to pay the tax. long overdue are programs of assistance to farm workers in housing, employment, health, social services and education . to protect the health of our citizens the government shall insure that all agricultural imports must meet the same quality standards as those imposed on agricultural products produced in the united states and that only quality american agricultural products be exported. fisheries america's fisheries must be protected and enhanced as a renewable resource through ecologically sound conservation practices and meaningful international agreements and compacts between individual states. environmental quality the democratic party's strong commitment to environmental quality is based on its conviction that environmental protection is not simply an aesthetic goal, but is necessary to achieve a more just society. cleaning up air and water supplies and controlling the proliferation of dangerous chemicals is a necessary part of a successful national health program. protecting the worker from workplace hazards is a key element of our full employment program. occupational disease and death must not be the price of a weekly wage. the democratic party, through the congress, has recognized the need for basic environmental security, and has authored a comprehensive program to achieve this objective. in eight years, the efforts to implement that program have been thwarted by an administration committed only to unfounded allegations that economic growth and environmental protection are incompatible . quite to the contrary, the democratic party believes that a concern for the environment need not and must not stand in the way of a much-needed policy of high economic growth. moreover, environmental protection creates jobs. environmental legislation enacted since already has produced more than one million jobs, and we pledge to continue to work for additional laws to protect, restore and preserve the environment while providing still more jobs. today, permanently harmful chemicals are dispersed, and irrecoverable land is rendered worthless. if we are to avoid repeated environmental crises, we must now renew our efforts to restore both environmental quality and economic growth. those who would use the environment must assume the burden of demonstrating that it will not be abused. for too long this burden has been on government agencies representing the public, to assess and hopefully correct the damage that has already been done. our irreplaceable natural and aesthetic resources must be managed to ensure abundance for future generations. strong land and ocean use planning is an essential element of such management. the artifacts of the desert, the national forests, the wilderness areas, the endangered species, the coastal beaches and barrier dunes and other precious resources are in danger. they cannot be restored. they must be protected. economic inequities created by subsidies for virgin materials to the disadvantage of recycled materials must be eliminated. depletion allowances and unequal freight rates serve to discourage the growing numbers of businesses engaged in recycling efforts. environmental research and development within the public sector should be increased substantially. for the immediate future, we must learn how to correct the damage we have already done, but more importantly, we need research on how to build a society in which renewable and non-renewable resources are used wisely and efficiently. federal environmental anti-pollution requirement programs should be as uniform as possible to eliminate economic discrimination. a vigorous program with national minimum environmental standards fully implemented, recognizing basic regional differences, will ensure that states and workers are not penalized by pursuing environmental programs. the technological community should be encouraged to produce better pollution control equipment, and more importantly, to produce technology which produces less pollution. vi. international relations the next democratic administration must and will initiate a new american foreign policy. eight-years of nixon-ford diplomacy have left our nation isolated abroad and divided at home. policies have been developed and applied secretly and arbitrarily by the executive department from the time of secret bombing in cambodia to recent covert assistance in angola. they have been policies that relied on ad hoc unilateral maneuvering, and a balance-of-power diplomacy suited better to the last century than to this one. they have disdained traditional american principles which once earned the respect of other peoples while inspiring our own. instead of efforts to foster freedom and justices in the world, the republican administration has built a sorry record of disregard for human rights manipulative interference in the internal affairs of other nations, and, frequently a greater concern for our relations with totalitarian adversaries than with our democratic allies. and its efforts to preserve rather than reform, the international status quo betray a self-fulfilling pessimism that contradicts a traditional american belief in the possibility of human progress. defense policy and spending for military forces must be consistent with meeting the real security needs of the american people we recognize that the security of our nation depends first and foremost on the internal strength of american society - economic, social and political. we also recognize that serious international threats to our security, such as shortages of food and raw materials, are not solely military in nature and cannot be met by military force or the threat of force. the republican administration has, through mismanagement and misguided policies, undermined the security of our nation by neglecting human needs at home while, for the first time in our nation's history, increasing military spending after a war. billions of dollars have been diverted into wasteful, extravagant and, in some instances, destabilizing military programs. our country can-and under a democratic administration it will - work vigorously for the adoption of policies of full employment and economic growth which will enable us to meet both the justified domestic needs of our citizens and our needs for an adequate national defense. a democratic administration will work to create a foreign policy that does justice to the strength and decency of the american people through adherence to these fundamental principles and priorities: we will act on the premise that candor in policy-making with all its liabilities, is preferable to deceit. the congress will be involved in the major international decisions of our government, and our foreign policies will be openly and consistently presented to the american people. for even if diplomatic tactics and national security information must sometimes remain secrets there can be no excuse for formulating and executing basic policy without public understanding and support. our policy must be based on our nation's commitment to the ideal of individual freedom and justice. experience has taught us not to rely solely on military strength or economic power, as necessary as they are, in pursuit of our international objectives. we must rely too on the moral strength of our democratic values - the greatest inspiration to our friends and the attribute most feared by our enemies. we will ensure that human needs are not sacrificed to military spending, while maintaining the military forces we require for our security. we will strengthen our ties to the other great democracies, working together to resolve common economic and social problems as well as to keep our defenses strong. we will restore the democratic tradition of friendship and support to third world nations. we must also seek areas of cooperation with our traditional adversaries. there is no other option, for human survival itself is at stake. but pursuit of detente will require maintenance of a strong american military deterrent, hard bargaining for our own interest, recognition of continuing competition, and a refusal to oversell the immediate benefits of such a policy to the american public. we will reaffirm the fundamental american commitment to human rights across the globe. america must work for a release of all political prisoners - men and women who are in jail simply because they have opposed peacefully the policies of their governments or have aided others who have - in all countries. america must take a firm stand to support and implement existing u.s. law to bring about liberalization of emigration policy in countries which limit or prohibit free emigration. america must be resolute in its support of the right of workers to organize and of trade unions to act freely and independently, and in its support of freedom of the press. america must continue to stand as a bulwark in support of human liberty in all countries. a return to the politics of principle requires a reaffirmation of human freedom throughout the world. the challenge of interdependence the international economy eight years of mismanagement of the american economy have contributed to global recession and inflation. the most important contribution a democratic administration will make to the returning health of the world economy will be to restore the health of our own economy, with all that means to international economic stability and progress. we are committed to trade policies that can benefit a full employment economy - through creation of new jobs for american workers, new markets for american farmers and businesses, and lower prices and a wider choice of goods for american consumers. orderly reductions in trade barriers should be negotiated on a reciprocal basis that does not allow other nations to deny us access to their markets while enjoying access to ours. these measures must be accompanied by improved programs to ease dislocations and to relieve the hardship of american workers affected by foreign competition. the democratic party will also seek to promote higher labor standards in those nations where productivity far outstrips wage rates, harming american workers through unfair exploitation of foreign labor, and encouraging american capital to pursue low wage opportunities that damage our own economy and weaken the dollar. we will exert leadership in international efforts to strengthen the world economic system. the ford administration philosophy of reliance on the international ""market economy"" is insufficient in a world where some governments and multinational corporations are active in managing and influencing market forces. we pledge constant efforts to keep world monetary systems functioning properly in order to provide a reasonably stable economic environment for business and to prevent the importation of inflation. we will support reform of the international monetary system to strengthen institutional means of coordinating national economic policies, especially with our european and japanese allies, thus facilitating efforts by our government and others to achieve full employment. the democratic party is committed to a strong and competitive merchant fleet, built in the united states and manned by american seamen, as an instrument of international relations and national security. in order to revitalize our merchant feet, the party pledges itself to a higher level of coordination of maritime policy, reaffirmation of the objectives of the merchant marine acts of and , and the development of a national cargo policy which assures the u.s. beet a fair participation in all u.s. trade. a democratic administration will vigorously pursue international negotiations to insure that the multinational activities of corporations, whether american or foreign, he made more responsible to the international community. we will give priority attention to the establishment of an international code of conduct for multinational corporations and host countries. we will encourage multinational corporations - before they relocate production across international boundaries - to make sufficient advance arrangements for the workers whose jobs will be affected. we will eliminate bribery and other corrupt practices. we will prevent these corporations from interfering in the political systems of the countries in which they operate. if such a code cannot be negotiated or proves to be unenforceable, our country should reserve the right to take unilateral action directed toward each of these problems, specifically including the outlawing of bribes and other improper payments to government officials of other nations. in pursuit of open and fair international economic relationships, we will seek mechanisms, including legislation, to ensure that foreign governments cannot introduce third party boycotts or racial and religious discrimination into the conduct of american foreign commerce. energy the united states must be a leader in promoting cooperation among the industrialized countries in developing alternative energy sources and reducing energy consumption, thus reducing our dependence on imports from the middle east and restraining high energy prices. under a democratic administration, the united states also will support international efforts to develop the vast energy potential of the developing countries. we will also actively seek to limit the dangers inherent in the international development of atomic energy and in the proliferation of nuclear weapons, steps to be given high priority will include: revitalization of the nonproliferation treaty, expansion of the international atomic energy agency and other international safeguards and monitoring of national facilities, cooperation against potential terrorism involving nuclear weapons, agreement by suppliers not to transfer enrichment or reprocessing facilities, international assurance of supply of nuclear fuel only to countries cooperating with strict nonproliferation measures, subsidization of multinational nuclear facilities, and gradual conversion to international control of non-weapons fissionable material. the developing world we have a historic opportunity in the next decade to improve the extent and quality of cooperation between the rich and poor countries. the potential benefits to our nation of a policy of constructive cooperation with the developing world would be considerable: uninterrupted access at reasonable cost to raw materials and to basic commodities; lower rates of global inflation, improved world markets for our goods; and a more benign atmosphere for international negotiation in general. above all, the prospects for the maintenance of peace will be vastly higher in a world in which fewer and fewer people suffer the pangs of hunger and the yoke of economic oppression. we support efforts to stabilize and increase export earnings of developing countries through our participation in reasonable commodity arrangements. we support strengthening of global financing mechanisms and trade liberalization efforts. we will assist in promoting greater developing country capital markets. because our country provides food and fiber to all the world, the american farmer is heavily dependent on world markets. these markets must be developed in a way that prevents the wild gyrations of food prices and the periodic shortages that have been common under recent republican administrations. we pledge significant financial support to the international fund for agricultural development; more effective food aid through further revision of the u.s. food for peace program; significant contributions to a multinational world food reserve system, with appropriate safeguards for american farmers; and continuing efforts to promote american food exports. the proliferation in arms, both conventional and nuclear, is a principal potential source of conflict in the developing as well as the industrialized world. the united states should limit significantly conventional arms sales and reduce military aid to developing countries, should include conventional arms transfers on the arms control agenda, and should regulate country-by-country justification for u.s. arms transfers, whether by sales or aid. such sales or aid must be justified in terms of foreign policy benefits to the united states and not simply because of their economic value to american weapons producers. a primary object of american aid, both military and economic, is first of all to enhance the condition of freedom in the world. the united states should not provide aid to any government - anywhere in the world - which uses secret police, detention without charges, and torture to enforce its powers. exceptions to this policy should be rare, and the aid provided should be limited to that which is absolutely necessary. the united states should be open and unashamed in its exercise of diplomatic efforts to encourage the observance of human rights in countries which receive american aid. current world population growth is a threat to the long-range well-being of mankind. we pledge to support effective voluntary family planning around the world, as well as at home, and to recognize officially the link between social and economic development and the willingness of the individual to limit family size. to be true to the traditional concern of americans for the disadvantaged and the oppressed, our aid programs should focus on alleviating poverty and on support of the quest for human liberty and dignity. we will work to see that the united states does its fair share in international development assistance efforts, including participation in the fifth replenishment of the world bank's international development association. we will implement a foreign assistance policy which emphasizes utilization of multilateral and regional development institutions, and one that includes a review of aid programs, country by country, to reinforce those projects whose financial benefits go to the people most in need and which are consistent with overall united states foreign policy goals. the world environment decay of the environment knows no national boundary. a government committed to protect our environment knows no national boundary. a government committed to protect our environment at home must also seek international cooperation in defending the global environment. working through and supporting such organizations as the united nations environmental program, we will join other governments in more effective efforts to preserve the quality and resources of the oceans; to preserve endangered species of fish and wildlife; to reverse the encroachment of the deserts, the erosion of the world's agricultural lands, and the accelerating destruction of its forests; to limit pollution of the atmosphere; and to control alterations of the global climate. criminal justice rights of americans abroad we will protect the rights and interests of americans charged with crimes or jailed in foreign countries by vigorously exerting all appropriate efforts to guarantee humane treatment and due process and to secure extradition to the united states where appropriate. international drug traffic we call for the use of diplomatic efforts to stop international production and trafficking in illicit drugs including the possible cut-off of foreign aid to noncooperating countries. defense policy the size and structure of our military forces must be carefully related to the demands of our foreign policies in this new era. these should be based on a careful assessment of what will be needed in the long-run to deter our potential adversaries, to fight successfully, if necessary, conventional wars in areas in which our national security is threatened, and to reassure our allies and friends - notably in western europe, japan and the near east. to this end, our strategic nuclear forces must provide a strong and credible deterrent to nuclear attack and nuclear blackmail. our conventional forces must be strong enough to deter aggression in areas whose security is vital to our own. in a manner consistent with these objectives, we should seek those disarmament and arms control agreements which will contribute to mutual reductions in both nuclear and conventional arms. the hallmarks of the nixon-ford administration's defense policy, however, have been stagnation and vulnerability. by its reluctance to make changes in those features of our armed forces which were designed to deal with the problems of the past, the administration has not only squandered defense dollars, but also neglected making improvements which area needed to increase our forces' fighting effectiveness and their capability to deter future aggression. by its undue emphasis on the overall size of the defense budget as the primary measure of both our national resolve and the proficiency of our armed forces, the administration has forgotten that we are seeking not to outspend, but to be able to deter and, if necessary, outfight our potential adversaries. while we must spend whatever is legitimately needed for defense, cutbacks on duplication and waste are both feasible and essential. barring any major change in the international situation, with the proper management, with the proper kind of investment of defense dollars, and with the proper choice of military programs we believe we can reduce present defense spending by about $-billion to $-billion. we must be tough-minded about the development of new weapons systems which add only marginal military value. the size of our defense budget should not be dictated by bureaucratic imperatives or the needs of defense contractors but by our assessment of international realities. in order to provide for a comprehensive review of the b- test and evaluation program, no decision regarding b- production should be made prior to february . the pentagon has one of the federal government's most overgrown bureaucracies. the department of defense can be operated more effectively and efficiently and its budget reduced, without in any way compromising our defense posture. our armed forces have many more admirals and generals today than during world war ii, when our fighting force was much larger than now. we can reduce the ratio of officers to men and of support forces to combat troops. misdirected efforts such as the construction of pork-barrel projects under the jurisdiction of the defense department can be terminated. exotic arms systems which serve no defense or foreign policy purpose should not be initiated. by ignoring opportunities to use our advanced technology innovatively to obtain maximum effectiveness in weapons and minimize complexity and cost, the republican administration has failed to reverse the trend toward increasingly intricate and expensive weapons systems. thus. it has helped to put our forces - particularly the navy - on the dangerous path of becoming both smaller in numbers and more vulnerable. a new approach is needed. our strategic nuclear forces should be structured to ensure their ability to survive nuclear attack, thereby assuring deterrence of nuclear war. successful nuclear deterrence is the single most important task of our armed forces. we should, however, avoid becoming diverted into making expenditures which have only symbolic or prestige value or which themselves contribute to nuclear instability the united states navy must remain the foremost fleet in the world. our naval forces should be improved to stress survivability and our modern technology should he used in new ways to keep the essential sea lanes open. concretely we should put more stress on new sensors and armaments and give priority to a navy consisting of a greater number of smaller and less vulnerable vessels. our land forces should be structured to fight effectively in support of our political and military commitments. to this end, modern, well-equipped and highly mobile land forces are more important than large numbers of sparsely-equipped infantry divisions . our tactical air forces should be designed to establish air superiority quickly in the event of hostilities, and to support our land and naval forces. we can and will make significant economies in the overhead and support structure of our military forces. the defense procurement system should be reformed to require, wherever possible and consistent with efforts to encourage full participation by small and minority businesses, advertised competitive bids and other improvements in procurement procedure so as to encourage full and fair competition among potential contractors and to cut the current waste in defense procurement. a more equitable formula should be considered for distribution of defense contracts and other federal procurement on a state or regional basis. the united states and other nations share a common interest in reducing military expenditures and transferring the savings into activities which raise living standards. in order to smooth the path for such changes, the executive branch and the congress should encourage long-range planning by defense-dependent communities and managements of defense firms and unions. this process should take place within the context of the democratic party's commitment to planned full employment. our civilian and military intelligence agencies should be structured to provide timely and accurate information and analysis of foreign affairs and military matters. covert action must be used only in the most compelling cases where the national security of the u.s. is vitally involved; assassination must be prohibited. there should be full and thorough congressional oversight of our intelligence agencies. the constitutional rights of american citizens can and must be fully protected, and intelligence abuses corrected, without endangering the confidentiality of properly classified intelligence or compromising the fundamental intelligence mission . u.s.-u.s.s.r. relations the united states and the soviet union are the only powers who, by rivalry or miscalculation, could bring general nuclear war upon our civilization. a principal goal must be the continued reduction of tension with the u.s.s.r. this can, however, only be accomplished by fidelity to our principles and interests and through businesslike negotiations about specific issues, not by the bad bargains, dramatic posturing, and the stress on general declarations that have characterized the nixon-ford administration's detente policy. soviet actions continue to pose severe threats to peace and stability in many parts of the world and to undermine support in the west for fruitful negotiations toward mutually beneficial agreements. the u.s.s.r. has undertaken a major military buildup over the last several years in its navy, in its strategic forces, and in its land forces stationed in eastern europe and asia. it has sought one-sided advantages in negotiations, and has exerted political and military pressure in such areas as the near east and africa, not hesitating to dispatch to angola its own advisors as well as the expeditionary forces of its clients. the continued u.s.s.r. military dominance of many eastern european countries remains a source of oppression for the peoples of those nations, an oppression we do not accept and to which we are morally opposed. any attempt by the soviet union similarly to dominate other parts of europe - such as yugoslavia - would be an action posing a grave threat to peace. eastern europe will not truly be an area of stability until these countries regain their independence and become part of a large european framework. our task is to establish u.s.-u.s.s.r. relations on a stable basis, avoiding excesses of both hope and fear. patience, a clear sense of our own priorities, and a willingness to negotiate specific firm agreements in areas of mutual interest can return balance to relations between the united states and the soviet union. in the field of nuclear disarmament and arms control we should work toward: limitations on the international spread of fissionable materials and nuclear weapons; specific strategic arms limitation agreements which will increase the stability of the strategic balance and reduce the risk of nuclear war, emphasizing mutual reductions and limitations on future weapons deployment which most threaten the strategic balance because their characteristics indicate a potential firststrike use; a comprehensive ban on nuclear tests; mutual reduction with the soviet union and others, under assured safeguards, of our nuclear arsenals, leading ultimately to the elimination of such arsenals; mutual restrictions with the soviet union and others on sales or other transfers of arms to developing countries; and conventional arms agreements and mutual and balanced force reductions in europe. however, in the area of strategic arms limitation, the u.s. should accept only such agreements that would not over-all limit the u.s. to levels of intercontinental strategic forces inferior to the limits provided for the soviet union. in the long-run, further development of more extensive economic relations between the united states and the soviet union may bring significant benefit to both societies. the u.s.s.r. has sought, however, through unfair trade practices to dominate such strategic fields as merchant shipping. rather than effectively resisting such efforts, the nixon-ford administration has looked favorably on such steps as subsidizing u.s.-u.s.s.r. trade by giving the soviet union concessionary credits, promoting trade increases because of a short-run hope of using trade to modify political behavior, and even placing major united states energy investments in pawn to soviet union policy. where bilateral trade agreements with the u.s.s.r. are to our economic advantage, we should pursue them, but our watch-words would be tough bargaining and concrete economic, political or other benefits for the united states. we should also press the soviet union to take a greater share of responsibility in multilateral solutions to such problems as creating adequate world grain reserves. our stance on the issue of human rights and political liberties in the soviet union is important to american self-respect and our moral standing in the world. we should continually remind the soviet union, by word and conduct, of its commitments in helsinki to the free flow of people and ideas and of how offensive we and other free people find its violations of the universal declaration of human rights. as part of our programs of official, technical, trade, cultural and other exchanges with the u.s.s.r., we should press its leaders to open their society to a genuine interchange of people and ideas. we must avoid assuming that the whole of american-soviet relations is greater than the sum of its parts, that any agreement is superior to none, or that we can negotiate effectively as supplicants. we must realize that our firmness can help build respect for us and improve the long-run opportunities for mutually-beneficial concrete agreements. we must beware of the notion that soviet-american relations are a seamless web in which concessions in one area will bring us benefits in others. by the same token, we must husband our resources to concentrate on what is most important to us. detente must be military as well as political. more fundamentally, we must recognize that the general character of our foreign policies will not and must not be set by our direct relationship with the soviet union. our allies and friends must come first. nor can the pursuit of our interests elsewhere in the world be dominated by concern for soviet views. for example, american policy toward china should continue to be based on a desire for a steady improvement and broadening of relations, whatever the tenor and direction of chinese-soviet relations. above all, we must be open, honest, mature and patient with ourselves and with our allies. we must recognize that, in the long-run, an effective policy toward the soviet union can only be grounded on honest discussion, and on a national and, to some extent, an international consensus. our own institutions, especially the congress, must be consulted and must help formulate our policy. the governments of our allies and friends must be made partners in our undertakings. haste and secret bilateral executive arrangements in our dealings with the u.s.s.r. can only promote a mood of uncertainty and suspicion which undermines the public support essential to effective and stable international relations. america in the world community many of the critical foreign policy issues we face require global approaches, but an effective international role for the united states also demands effective working with the special interests of specific foreign nations and regions. the touchstone of our policy must be our own interests, which in turn means that we should not seek or expect to control events everywhere. indeed, intelligent pursuit of our objectives demands a realization that even where our interests are great and our involvement essential, we do not act alone, but in a world setting where others have interests and objectives as well. we cannot give expression to our national values without continuing to play a strong role in the affairs of the united nations and its agencies. firm and positive advocacy of our positions is essential. we should make a major effort at reforming and restructuring the u.n. systems. the intensity of interrelated problems is rapidly increasing, and it is likely that in the future, the issues of war and peace will be more a function of economic and social problems than of the military security problems that have dominated international relations since . the heat of debate at the general assembly should not obscure the value of our supporting united nations involvement in keeping the peace and in the increasingly complex technical and social problems-such as pollution, health, economic development and population growth-that challenge the world community, but we must let the world know that anti-american polemics is no substitute for sound policy and that the united nations is weakened by harsh rhetoric from other countries or by blasphemous resolutions such as the one equating zionism and racism. a democratic administration should seek a fair and comprehensive law-of-the-sea treaty that will balance the interests of the developed and less developed countries. europe the nations of western europe, together with japan, are among our closest allies. except for our closest neighbors in this hemisphere, it is in these regions where our interests are most strongly linked with those of other nations. at the same time, the growing economic and political strength of europe and japan creates areas of conflict and tension in a relationship both sides must keep close and healthy. on the great economic issues - trade, energy, employment, international finance, resources - we must work with the europeans, the japanese and other nations to serve our long-run mutual interests in stability and growth, and in the development of poorer nations. the military security of europe is fundamental to our own. to that end, nato remains a vital commitment. we should retain in europe a u.s. contribution to nato forces so that they are sufficient to deter or defeat attack without premature resort to nuclear weapons. this does not exclude moderate reductions in manpower levels made possible by more efficiency, and it affirmatively requires a thorough reform and overhaul of nato forces, plans and deployments. we encourage our european allies to increase their share of the contributions to nato defense, both in terms of troops and hardware. by mutual agreement or through modernizations, the thousands of tactical nuclear weapons in europe should be reduced, saving money and manpower and increasing our own and international security. europe, like the rest of the world, faces substantial political change. we cannot control that process. however, we can publicly make known our preference for developments consistent with our interests and principles. in particular, we should encourage the most rapid possible growth of stable democratic institutions in spain, and a continuation on the path of democracy of portugal and greece, opposing authoritarian takeover from either left or right. we can make clear our sense of the risks and dangers of communist participation in western european governments, while being equally clear that we will work on a broad range of non-military matters with any legally-constituted government that is prepared to do the same with us. we similarly must reaffirm our support for the continued growth and cohesion of the institutions of the european community. the voice of the united states should be heard in northern ireland against violence and terror, against the discrimination, repression and deprivation which brought about that civil strife, and for the efforts of the parties toward a peaceful resolution of the future of northern ireland. pertinent alliances such as nato and international organizations such as the united nations should be fully apprised of the interests of the united states with respect to the status of ireland in the international community of nations. we must do all that is possible, consistent with our interest in a strong nato in southern europe and stability in the eastern mediterranean, to encourage a fair settlement of the cyprus issue, which continues to extract human costs. middle east we shall continue to seek a just and lasting peace in the middle east. the cornerstone of our policy is a firm commitment to the independence and security of the state of israel. this special relationship does not prejudice improved relations with other nations in the region. real peace in the middle east will permit israel and her arab neighbors to turn their energies to internal development and will eliminate the threat of world conflict spreading from tensions there. the middle east conflict is complex, and a realistic, pragmatic approach is essential. our policy must be based on firm adherence to these fundamental principles of middle east policy: we will continue our consistent support of israel, including sufficient military and economic assistance to maintain israel's deterrent strength in the region, and the maintenance of u.s. military forces in the mediterranean adequate to deter military intervention by the soviet union. we steadfastly oppose any move to isolate israel in the international arena or suspend it from the united nations or its constituent organizations. we will avoid efforts to impose on the region an externally devised formula for settlements and will provide support for initiatives toward settlement, based on direct face to-face negotiation between the parties and normalization of relations and a full peace within secure and defensible boundaries. we vigorously support the free passage of shipping in the middle east - especially in the suez canal. we recognize that the solution to the problems of arab and jewish refugees must be among the factors taken into account in the course of continued progress toward peace. such problems cannot be solved, however. by recognition of terrorist groups which refuse to acknowledge their adversary's right to exist, or groups which have no legitimate claim to represent the people for whom they purport to be speaking. we support initiation of government enforcement action to insure that stated u.s. policy - in opposition to boycotts against friendly countries - is fully and vigorously implemented. we recognize and support the established status of jerusalem as the capital of israel. with free access to all its holy places provided to all faiths. as a symbol of this stand, the u.s. embassy should be moved from tel aviv to jerusalem. asia we remain a pacific power with important stakes and objectives in the region, but the vietnam war has taught us the folly of becoming militarily involved where our vital interests were not at stake. friendship and cooperation with japan are the cornerstone of our asian interests and policy. our commitment to the security of japan is central to our own, and it is an essential condition to a constructive peaceful role for that nation in the future of asia. in our economic dealings with japan, we must make clear our insistence on mutuality of benefits and opportunities, while focusing on ways to expand our trade avoiding economic shocks and resultant retaliation on either side. we must avoid the ""shocks"" to japan which have resulted from republican foreign policy. we reaffirm our commitment to the security of the republic of korea, both in itself and as a key to the security of japan. however, on a prudent and carefully planned basis, we can redeploy, and gradually phase out, the u.s. ground forces, and can withdraw the nuclear weapons now stationed in korea without endangering that support as long as our tactical air and naval forces in the region remain strong. our continued resolve in the area should not be misunderstood. however, we deplore the denial of human rights in the republic of korea just as we deplore the brutal and aggressive acts of the regime in north korea. we have learned, at a tragically high price, certain lessons regarding southeast asia. we should not seek to control the political future of that region. rather, we should encourage and welcome peaceful relations with the nations of that area. in conjunction with the fullest possible accounting of our citizens still listed as missing in action, we should move toward normalized relations with vietnam. no foreign policy that reflects traditional american humanitarian concerns can be indifferent to the plight of the peoples of the asian subcontinent. the recent improvement in relations with china, which has received bipartisan support, is a welcome recognition that there are few areas in which our vital interests clash with those of china. our relations with china should continue to develop on peaceful lines, including early movement toward normalizing diplomatic relations in the context of a peaceful resolution of the future of taiwan. the americas we recognize the fundamental importance of close relations and the easing of economic tension with our canadian and mexican neighbors. in the last eight years, our relations with latin america have deteriorated amid high-level indifference, increased military domination of latin american governments, and revelations of extensive american interference in the internal politics of chile and other nations. the principles of the good neighbor policy and the alliance for progress, under which we are committed to working with the nations of the americas as equals, remain valid today but seem to have been forgotten by the present administration. the u.s. should adopt policies on trade, aid and investment that include commodity agreements and an appropriate system of trade preferences. we must make clear our revulsion at the systematic violations of basic human rights that have occurred under some latin american military regimes. we pledge support for a new panama canal treaty, which insures the interests of the united states in that waterway, recognizes the principles already agreed upon, takes into account the interests of the canal work force, and which will have wide hemispheric support. relations with cuba can only be normalized if cuba refrains from interference in the internal affairs of the united states and releases all u.s. citizens currently detained in cuban prisons and labor camps for political reasons. we can move towards such relations if cuba abandons its provocative international actions and policies . africa eight years of indifference, accompanied by increasing cooperation with racist regimes, have left our influence and prestige in africa at an historical low. we must adopt policies that recognize the intrinsic importance of africa and its development to the united states, and the inevitability of majority rule on that continent. the first task is to formulate a rational african policy in terms of enlightened u.s. african priorities, not a corollary of u.s.-soviet policy. angola demonstrated that we must have sound relations with black africa and disassociate our policies from those of south africa to achieve the desired african response to soviet expansionism in africa. our policy must foster high-level u.s.-africa communications and establish a sound basis for dealing when crises arise. the next democratic administration will work aggressively to involve black americans in foreign policy positions, at home and abroad, and in decisions affecting african interests. to promote african economic development, the u.s. should undertake increased bilateral and multilateral assistance, continue congressional initiatives in food assistance and food production, with special aid to the sahel and implementation of the sahel development plan; and carry forward our commitment to negotiate with developing countries on key trade and economic issues such as commodity arrangements and trade preferences . our policy must be reformulated towards unequivocal and concrete support of majority rule in southern africa, recognizing that our true interests lie in peaceful progress toward a free south africa for all south africans, black and white. as part of our commitment to the development of a free and democratic south africa, we should support the position of african nations in denying recognition to ""homelands"" given pseudoindependence by the south african government under its current policy of ""separate development."" the republican administration's relaxation of the arms embargo against south africa must be ended, and the embargo tightened to prevent transfers of military significance, particularly of nuclear material. the u.s. government should not engage in any activity regarding namibia that would recognize or support the illegal south african administration, including granting tax credits to u.s. companies doing business in namibia and paying taxes to south africa. moreover, the u.s. government should deny tax advantages to all corporations doing business in south africa and rhodesia who support or participate in apartheid practices and policies . the u.s. government should fully enforce the u.n.-ordered rhodesia sanctions, seek universal compliance with such measures, and repeal the byrd amendment. efforts should be made to normalize relations with angola.","['preamble', 'meet', 'adopt', 'democratic', 'platform', 'nominate', 'democratic', 'candidates', 'president', 'vice', 'president', 'united',

Republican Party,1976,1970,rep_1976.csv,CSV,"Preamble To you, an American citizen: You are about to read the 1976 Republican Platform. We hope you will also find time to read the Democrats' Platform. Compare You will see basic differences in how the two parties propose to represent you . ""The Platform is the Party's contract with the people."" This is what it says on the cover of the official printing of the Democrat Platform. So it should be. The Democrats' Platform repeats the same thing on every page: More government, more spending, more inflation. Compare. This Republican Platform says exactly the opposite - less government, less spending, less inflation. In other words, we want you to retain more of your own money, money that represents the worth of your labors, to use as you see fit for the necessities and conveniences of life. No matter how many statements to the contrary that Mr. Carter makes, he is firmly attached to a contract with you to vastly increase the powers of government. Is bigger government in Washington really what you want? Make no mistake: You cannot have bigger programs in Washington and less government by Washington. You must choose. What is the cost of these added or expanded programs? The Democrats' Platform is deliberately vague. When they tell you, as they do time after time, that they will ""expand federal support,"" you are left to guess the cost. The price tag of five major Democrat Platform promises could add as much as $100-billion to the annual cost of government. But the Democrats' Platform proposes over 60 new or expanded spending programs and the expansion or creation of some 22 Washington agencies, offices or bureaus. In fact, the total of all Democrat proposals can be as high as $200-billion a year While this must be a rough estimate, it does give you a clue to the magnitude and direction of these commitments: The Democrats' Platform can increase federal spending by 50 percent. If a Democrat Congress passes the Democrat Platform and it is signed by a Democrat President, what happens then? The Democrats could raise your taxes by 50 per cent to pay for the new programs Or the Democrats could not raise taxes and the result would be a runaway inflation. Of course, contract or no contract, the Democrats may not honor their promises, Are you prepared to risk it? In stark contrast to the Democrats' Platform, we offer you a responsive and moderate alternative based on these principles: - We believe that liberty can be measured by how much freedom you have to make your own decisions - even your own mistakes. Government must step in when your liberties impinge on your neighbors. Government must protect your constitutional rights. Government must deal with other governments and protect you from aggressors. Government must assure equal opportunity. And government must be compassionate in caring for those citizens who are unable to care for themselves. - Our federal system of local-state-national government is designed to sort out on what level these actions should be taken. Those concerns of a national character - such as air and water pollution that do not respect state boundaries or the national transportation system or efforts to safeguard your civil liberties - must, of course, be handled on the national level. - As a general rule, however, we believe that government action should be taken first by the government that resides as close to you as possible. Governments tend to become less responsive to your needs the farther away they are from you. Thus, we prefer local and state government to national government, and decentralized national government wherever possible. - We also believe that you, often acting through voluntary organizations, should have the opportunity to solve many of the social problems of your community. This spirit of freely helping others is uniquely American and should be encouraged in every way by government. - Every dollar spent by government is a dollar earned by you. Government must always ask: Are your dollars being wisely spent? Can we afford it? Is it not better for the country to leave your dollars in your pocket? - Your elected officials, their appointees, and government workers are expected to perform their public acts with honesty, openness, diligence, and special integrity. At the heart of our system must be confidence that these people are always working for you. - We believe that your initiative and energy create jobs, our standard of living and the underlying economic strength of the country. Government must work for the goal of justice and the elimination of unfair practices, but no government has yet designed a more productive economic system or one which benefits as many people . - The beauty of our land is our legacy to our children. It must be protected by us so that they can pass it on intact to their children . - The United States must always stand for peace and liberty in the world and the rights of the individual. We must form sturdy partnerships with our allies for the preservation of freedom. We must be ever willing to negotiate differences, but equally mindful that there are American ideals that cannot be compromised. Given that there are other nations with potentially hostile designs, we recognize that we can reach our goals only while maintaining a superior national defense that is second to none. We support these principles because they are right, knowing full well that they will not be easy to achieve. Acting with restraint is most difficult when confronted by an opposition Congress that is determined to promise everything to everybody. And this is what the Democrat Congress has been doing. A document, such as this Platform, which refuses to knuckle under to special interest groups, will be accused of being ""uncaring."" Yet it is exactly because we do care about your basic freedom to manage your own life with a minimum of government interference, because we do care about encouraging permanent and meaningful jobs, because we do care about your getting paid in sound dollars, because we do care about resisting the use of your tax dollars for wasteful or unproven programs-it is for these reasons that we are proposing only actions that the nation can afford and are opposing excessive tinkering with an economic system-that works better than any other in the world. Our great American Republic was founded on the principle: ""one nation under God, with liberty and justice for all."" This bicentennial year marks the anniversary of the greatest secular experiment in history: That of seeking to determine that a people are truly capable of self-government: It was our ""Declaration"" which put the world and posterity on notice ""that all Men are...endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights"" and that those rights must not be taken from those to whom God has given them. Recently, Peggy Pinder, a 23-year-old student from Grinnell, Iowa, who is a delegate to this convention, said that she joined our party ""because Republicans understand the place of government in the people's lives better than the Democrats. Republicans try to find ways to take care of needs through the private sector first while it seems automatic for Democrats to take care of them through the governmental system ."" The perception of Peggy Pinder governs this Platform. Aren't these the principles that you want your elected representatives to have? Jobs and Inflation We believe it is of paramount importance that the American people understand that the number one destroyer of jobs is inflation. We wish to stress that the number one cause of inflation is the government's expansion of the nation's supply of money and credit needed to pay for deficit spending. It is above all else deficit spending by the federal government which erodes the purchasing power of the dollar. Most Republicans in Congress seem to understand this fundamental cause-and-effect relationship and their support in sustaining over 40 Presidential vetoes in the past two years has prevented over $13-billion in federal spending. It is clear that most of the Democrats do not understand this vital principle, or, if they do, they simply don't care. Inflation is the direct responsibility of a spendthrift Democrat-controlled Congress that has been unwilling to discipline itself to live within our means. The temptation to spend and deficit spend for political reasons has simply been too great for most of our elected politicians to resist. Individuals, families, companies and most local and state governments must live within a budget. Why not Congress? Republicans hope every American realizes that if we are to permanently eliminate high unemployment, it is essential to protect the integrity of our money. That means putting an end to deficit spending. The danger, sooner or later, is runaway inflation. Wage and price controls are not the solution to inflation. They attempt to treat only the symptom - rising prices - not the cause. Historically, controls have always been a dismal failure, and in the end they create only shortages, black markets and higher prices. For these reasons the Republican Party strongly opposes any reimposition of such controls, on a standby basis or otherwise. Unfortunately, the Democrat-controlled Congress now persists in attempting to obtain control over our nation's money creation policies by taking away the independence of the Federal Reserve Board. The same people who have so massively expanded government spending should not be allowed politically to dominate our monetary policy. The independence of the Federal Reserve System must be preserved. Massive, federally-funded public employment programs, such as the Humphrey-Hawkins Bill currently embraced by the new National Platform of the Democrat Party will cost billions and can only be financed either through very large tax increases or through ever increasing levels of deficit spending. Although such government ""make-work"" programs usually provide a temporary stimulus to the economy, ""quick-fix"" solutions of this sort - like all narcotics - lead to addiction, larger and larger doses, and ultimately the destruction of far more jobs than they create Sound job creation can only be accomplished in the private sector of the economy. Americans must not be fooled into accepting government as the employer of last resort. Nor should we sit idly by while 2.5 million American jobs are threatened by imports of textile products. We encourage the renewal of the GATT Multifiber Arrangement and the signing of other necessary bilateral agreements to protect our domestic textile industry. In order to be able to provide more jobs, businesses must be able to expand; yet in order to build and expand, they must be profitable and able to borrow funds (savings) that someone else has been willing to part with on a temporary basis. In the long run, inflation discourages thrift, encourages debt and destroys the incentive to save which is the mainspring of capital formation. When our government - through deficit spending and debasement of the currency - destroys the incentive to save and to invest, it destroys the wellspring of American productivity. Obviously, when production falls, the number of jobs decline. The American people are beginning to understand that no government can ever add real wealth (purchasing power) to an economy by simply turning on the printing presses or by creating credit out of thin air. All government can do is confiscate and redistribute wealth. No nation can spend its way into prosperity; a nation can only spend its way into bankruptcy. Taxes and Government Spending The Republican Party recognizes that tax policies and spending policies are inseparable. If government spending is not controlled, taxes will inevitably rise either directly or through inflation. By failing to tie spending directly to income, the Democrat-controlled Congress has not kept faith with the American people. Every American knows he cannot continually live beyond his means. The Republican Party advocates a legislative policy to obtain a balanced federal budget and reduced tax rates. While the best tax reform is tax reduction, we recognize the need for structural tax adjustments to help the working men and women of our nation. To that end, we recommend tax credits for college tuition, post-secondary technical training and child care expenses incurred by working parents. Over the past two decades of Democrat-control of the Congress, our tax laws have become a nightmare of complexity and unfair tax preferences, virtually destroying the credibility of the system. Simplification should be a major goal of tax reform . We support economic and tax policies to insure the necessary job-producing expansion of our economy. These include hastening capital recovery through new systems of accelerated depreciation, removing the tax burden on equity financing to encourage more capital investment, ending the unfair double taxation of dividends, and supporting proposals to enhance the ability of our working and other citizens to own ""a piece of the action"" through stock ownership. When balanced by expenditure reductions, the personal exemption should be raised to $1,000. Agriculture and Rural Development The bounty of our farms is so plentiful that we may tend to forget what an amazing production achievement this really is. The American farmer and rancher produces enough food to feed over 56 people-a threefold increase in productivity in 20 years. Rural America must be maintained as a rewarding place to live. To accomplish this, our rural areas are entitled to services comparable to their urban neighbors, such as water and sewer systems, improved electricity and telephone service, adequate transportation, available and adequate financial credit, and employment opportunities which will allow small farmers to supplement their incomes. Farm exports have continued to expand under the policies of this Republican Administration - from a low of $6-billion in 1968, the last Democrat year, to $22 billion in 1975. These exports are not giveaway programs, most are earning dollars from the marketplaces of the world, establishing a favorable balance of trade and a higher standard of living for all. Through our farm exports we fight the problem of world hunger, especially with the humanitarian Food for Peace Program (Public Law 480) of the Eisenhower Administration and the Republican-controlled Congress of 1954. Republican farm policy has permitted farmers to use their crop land fully. We are at last moving toward making effective use of our superb resources. Net farm income from 1972 through 1975 averaged $26-billion, more than double the average of the 1960's. Government should not dictate to the productive men and women who work the land. To assure this, we support the continuation of the central principles of the Agricultural Act of 1973, with adjustments of target prices and loan levels to reflect increased production costs. We oppose government-controlled grain reserves, just as we oppose federal regulations that are unrealistic in farm practices, such as those imposed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We urge prompt action by Congress in amending the Grain Inspection Act to strengthen the present inspection system and restore its integrity. We firmly believe that when the nation asks our farmers to go all out to produce as much as possible for world-wide markets, the government should guarantee them unfettered access to those markets. Our farmers should not be singled out by export controls. Also, when a foreign nation subsidizes its farm exports, our farmers deserve a protection against such unfair practices. The federal government should assure that foreign imported commodities are equal in quality to our domestic commodities. Nations from whom we buy commodities should not be allowed to circumvent import restriction laws, such as the Meat Import Quota Act of 1964. We recognize the importance of the multilateral trade negotiations now in progress and urge our representatives to obtain the most beneficial agreements for our farmers and the nation's economy. In order to assure the consumers of America an uninterrupted source of food, it is necessary to pass labor relations legislation which is responsive to the welfare of workers and to the particular needs of ford production. Such legislation should recognize the need to prevent work stoppages during critical harvest periods. We must help farmers protect themselves from drought, flood and other natural disasters through a system of all-risk crop insurance through federal government reinsurance of private insurance companies combined with the existing disaster payment program. As in 1972, we urge prompt passage of the Republican-sponsored legislation now pending in Congress which will increase the estate tax exemption to $200,000, allow valuation of farm property on a current use basis and provide for extension of the time of payment in the case of farms and small businesses This overdue estate and gift tax legislation must be approved this year. We favor a liberalized marital deduction and oppose capital gains tax at death. Innovations in agriculture need to be encouraged by expanding research programs including new pest and predator control measures, and utilization of crops as a new energy resource, If we expect our farmers to produce an abundant food supply, they must have all the energy they need to produce, market and process their crops and livestock. We continue to support farmer cooperatives, including rural electric and telephone cooperatives, in their efforts to improve services to their members. We support the Capper-Volstead Act. We believe that non-farm corporations and tax-loss farming should be prevented from unfairly competing against family farms, which we support as the preferred method of farm organization. Since farmers are practicing conservationists, they should not be burdened with unrealistic environmental regulations. We are concerned about regulations issued by the Army Corps of Engineers that will regulate all ""routine"" agricultural and forestry activities on ""all"" our waters and wetland, and support legislation to exempt routine farming operations from these requirements. The adjudication of water rights should be a matter of state determination. Small Business Small business, so vital to our economic system, is free enterprise in its purest sense. It holds forth opportunity to the individual, regardless of race or sex, to fulfill the American dream. Small businesses are the base of our economy and its main source of strength. Some 9.6 million small firms generate 55 per cent of our private employment-or the livelihood of over 100 million Americans. Yet while small businesses have a unique place in our society, they also have unique problems that government must address. Therefore, we recommend that the Small Business Administration (SBA): - Assure adequate financing to those credit worthy firms that cannot now obtain funds through conventional channels; - Include the proper mix of loan programs to meet the needs of the many different types of firms that constitute the American small business community; - Serve as an aggressive advocate for small business and provide procurement, management and technological assistance. For survival, small businesses must have relief from the overwhelming burden placed on them by many regulatory bodies. Paperwork proliferation has grown out of control, and small business is not equipped to deal with this aggravation. The present tax structure does not allow small firms to generate enough capital to grow and create jobs. Estate taxes need liberalization to benefit the family business in the same manner as for the family farm. Encouraging investment in small businesses through more equitable tax treatment remains the best and least expensive method of creating productive employment. The Republican Party, recognizing that small and independent business is the backbone of the American competitive system, pledges itself to strengthen this vital institution. Antitrust The Republican Party believes in and endorses the concept that the American economy is traditionally dependent upon fair competition in the marketplace. To assure fair competition, antitrust laws must treat all segments of the economy equally. Vigorous and equitable enforcement of antitrust laws heightens competition and enables consumers to obtain the lowest possible price in the marketplace. Bureaucratic Overregulation We believe that the extent of federal regulation and bureaucratic interference in the lives of the American people must be reduced. The programs and activities of the federal government should be required to meet strict tests of their usefulness and effectiveness. In particular, we consider essential an analysis of the extensive growth of laws and regulations governing production processes and conditions and standards for consumer products, so as to determine whether the services and benefits the American people receive are worth the price they are paying for these services in higher taxes and consumer prices. We are intensely aware of the need to protect our environment and provide safe working conditions in American industry, while at the same time preventing the loss of jobs and the closing of small businesses through unrealistic or over-rigorous government regulations. We support a balanced approach that considers the requirements of a growing economy and provides jobs for American workers. The average businessman and employer is being overwhelmed by government-required paperwork. We support legislation to control and reduce the burden of federal paperwork, particularly that generated by the Internal Revenue Service and the Census Bureau. Government That Works We believe that Americans are fed up with and frustrated by national government that makes great promises and fails to deliver. We are. We think that Democrat Congresses - in control for 40 out of 44 years - are the grand masters of this practice. We think that national government that has grown so big that the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing has also caused the condition we are in. What we now have is a government organization that doesn't make any sense. It has not developed by design. It just grew - by whim, bureaucratic fighting, and the caving in of Democratic Congresses to special interest demands. So today we find that nine federal departments and 20 independent agencies are involved in education; seven departments and eight agencies in health; federal recreation areas are administered by six agencies in three departments, and so forth. What we need is a top-to-bottom overhaul. Two high level presidential commissions under two Presidents - one a Democrat, one a Republican - have investigated and come up with the same answer: There must be functional realignment of government, instead of the current arrangement by subject areas or constituencies . We want federal domestic departments to reflect the major purposes of government, such as natural resources, human resources, community development and the economic affairs. Unfortunately, the Democrat Congress has refused to address this problem. Now we insist that attention must be paid. Too often in the past, we have been content with organizational or procedural solutions to complex economic and social regulatory problems. We should no longer accept rhetoric as a substitute for concrete results. The President has proposed to Congress the Agenda for Government Reform Act, which would guarantee the systematic re-examination and reform of all federal regulatory activities within the next four years. This legislation requires Congress and the President to agree to undertake an exhaustive reassessment of the combined effects of all government regulations, and it requires them to adhere to a disciplined timetable to assure annual results. The American people deserve no less. Every agency of government must be made efficient, and every government regulation should be subjected to cost benefit analysis. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is a typical example of a well-intentioned regulatory effort which has imposed large costs but has not solved our problems. The beauty of America's original concept of government was its diversity, the belief that different purposes are best served by governments at different levels. In our lifetime, however, Democrat Congresses have allowed this system to become warped and over-nationalized. As powers have flowed to Washington, the ability to attend to our problems has often dried up in our communities and states. This trend must be reversed. Local government is simply more accountable to the people, and local people are perfectly capable of making decisions. We reaffirm the long standing principle of the Republican Party that the best government is the one closest to the people. It is less costly, more accountable, and more responsive to the people's needs. Our confidence in the people of this nation was demonstrated by initiating the Revenue Sharing Program. To date, $30-billion of federal tax dollars have been returned to the states and localities. This program is administered with fewer than 100 people and a computer. Revenue Sharing is an effort to reverse the trend toward centralization. Revenue Sharing must continue without unwarranted federal strictures and regulations. As a further step in this direction, the Republicans in Congress promoted the new concept of federal block grants to localities for much greater flexibility. Under block grants, federal funds can be tailored by the states and localities to the wishes of each community. There are now two block grant programs - in community development and employment training. Block grant programs should be extended to replace many existing categorical health, education, child nutrition and social programs. The Democrat Congress stands guilty of failing to enact these vital reforms. Our ultimate goal is to restore taxing and spending to the local level. The Republican Party has always believed that the proper role of government is to do only those things which individuals cannot do for themselves. We encourage individual initiative and oppose the trend of ever expanding government programs which is destroying the volunteer spirit in America. We firmly believe that community involvement is essential to the development of effective solutions to the problems confronting our country. While we oppose a uniform national primary, we encourage the concept of regional presidential primaries, which would group those states which voluntarily agree to have presidential primaries in a geographical area on a common date. We encourage full participation in our electoral process. We further recognize the sanctity and value of the ballot. In that regard, we oppose ""federal post card registration."" The possibilities could not only cheapen our ballot, but in fact threaten the entire electoral process. Control of the United States Congress by the Democrat Party for 40 of the past 44 years has resulted in a system dominated by powerful individuals and riddled with corruption. Recent events have demonstrated an unwillingness and inability by the Democrat Party to cleanse itself. Selective morality has been the order of the day. Positive Republican initiatives have languished in Democrat-controlled Congressional Committees while business as usual has continued in Washington. The American people demand and deserve reform of the United States Congress. We offer these proposals of far-reaching reform: - Repeal of legislation which permits automatic increases in the salaries of Members of Congress, congressional staffs, and official expense allowances. Public accountability demands that Members publicly vote on increases on the expenses of their office. Members' salary increases should not become effective until a new Congress is elected. - Elimination of proxy voting which allows Members to record votes in Committee without being present for the actual deliberations or vote on a measure. - Elimination of Democrat Caucus rules which allow a Party to bind its Members' votes on legislation. Each Member of Congress represents his constituency and must be free to vote in accordance with the dictates of his constituency and individual conscience. - A complete audit by the General Accounting Office of all congressional allowances and appropriate disciplinary measures for those who have violated the public trust. - Full public disclosure of financial interests by Members and divestiture of those interests which present conflicts of interest. - Changes in the House rules which would allow a House majority to require the House Ethics Committee to conduct an investigation into alleged misconduct by any Member of Congress if the Committee refuses to act on its own. - A complete overhaul and streamlining of the system which has permitted the proliferation of subcommittees. with overlapping responsibilities, vague jurisdictional definitions and a lack of legislative production . - Quarterly publication of names, titles and salaries of all Congressional employees. - Improved lobby disclosure legislation so that the people will know how much money is being spent to influence public officials . Citizens are demanding the end to the rapid and wasteful increase in the size of Washington government. All steps must be taken to insure that unnecessary federal agencies and programs are eliminated and that Congress carefully scrutinize the total budget of each agency. If it is determined that sunset laws and zero-based budgeting can accomplish these ends then they will have our support. Washington programs must be made as cost-effective as those in the states and localities. Among the many serious complaints that we wish to register on behalf of the American people is the poor operation of the United States Postal Service We note the low respect the public has for Congress - a Democrat-controlled institution - and wonder how the Democrats can possibly honor their pledge government when they have utterly failed to reform Congress. A Safe and Just Society Every American has a right to be protected from criminals. Violence has no place in our land. A society that excuses crime will eventually fall victim to it. The American people have been subjected to an m intolerable wave of violent crime. The victim of a crime should be treated with compassion and justice. The attacker must be kept from harming others. Emphasis must be on protecting the innocent and punishing the guilty. Prevention of it crime is its best deterrent and should be stressed. Fighting crime is -and should be - primarily a local responsibility. We support the continuation of the federal help given through the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration to law enforcement officials in our states, counties and municipalities. Each state should have the power to decide whether it wishes to impose the death penalty for certain crimes. All localities are urged to tighten their bail practices and to review their sentencing and parole procedures. The federal criminal code should include automatic and mandatory minimum sentences for persons committing offenses under federal jurisdiction that involve the use of a dangerous weapon; that involve exceptionally serious crimes, such as trafficking in hard drugs, kidnapping and aircraft hijacking; and that involve injuries committed by repeat offenders. The work presently being done to tighten the anti-obscenity provisions of the criminal code has our full support. Since the jurisdiction of the federal government in this field is limited to interstate commerce and the mails, we urge state and local governments to assume a major role in limiting the distribution and availability of obscene materials. We support the right of citizens to keep and bear arms. We oppose federal registration of firearms. Mandatory sentences for crimes committed with a lethal weapon are the only effective solution to this problem. Sure and swift justice demands additional judges, United States Attorneys and other court workers. The Democrat Congress has created no new federal judgeships since 1970; we deplore this example of playing politics with the justice system. Drug abuse is not simply a health problem, but also a very real law enforcement concern and a problem of worldwide dimension. Controlling drug abuse calls for the ratification of the existing international treaty on synthetic drugs, increased emphasis on preventing the diversion of amphetamines and barbiturates into illegal markets, and intensive efforts to keep drugs out of this country. Heroin continues top come across our borders. Drug enforcement agents and international cooperation must cut off this supply. We say: Treat the addicts, but, at the same time, remove the pushers from the street and give them mandatory sentences Juveniles now account for almost half the arrests for serious crimes - murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. The cost of school violence and vandalism is estimated at $600 million annually, about what is spent on textbooks. Primary responsibility for raising our children, instilling proper values and thus preventing juvenile delinquency lies with the family, not the government. Yet when families fail, local law enforcement authorities must respond. Law enforcement block grant funds can be used by states in correcting and preventing juvenile delinquency. The LEAA should promote additional research in this area. The structure of the family must be strengthened. All enterprises have to be encouraged to find more jobs for young people. A youth differential must be included in the minimum wage law. Citizen action should let the television industry know that we want it to curb violence in programming because of its effect on our youth. The criminal justice system must be more vigilant in preventing rape, eliminating discrimination against the victim and dealing with the offenders. States should recognize that antiquated and overcrowded prisons are not conducive to rehabilitation. A high priority of prison reform should be to help the young first-time offender. There should be adequate separation of young from adult offenders, more relevant prison industries, better counseling, community-based alternatives and more help in getting a job for the offender who has served his or her time. Terrorism - both domestic and international - must be stopped. Not only must the strongest steps be taken in the United States, but collective action must come from all nations. Deterring every form of hijacking calls for sanctions against countries that aid terrorists. The world community should take appropriate action to deal with terrorist organizations. We applaud the daring rescue by Israel of innocent civilian hostages who were kidnapped by terrorists. While we regret that loss of life was involved, the courageous manner in which the hostages were freed speaks eloquently to our abhorrence of world bandits. The Right to Privacy Liberty depends in great measure on the privacy that each American retains. We are alarmed by Washington's growing collection of information. The number of federal data banks is now estimated at between 800 and 900 and more than 50 agencies are involved. We question the need for all these computers to be storing records of our lives. Safeguards must protect us against this information being misused or disclosed. Major changes, for example, are needed to maintain the confidentiality of tax returns and Social Security records. Recent Supreme Court decisions have held that an individual has no constitutional right to the privacy of records held in banks or other depository institutions and that they can be readily obtained by law enforcement agencies without a person's consent or knowledge. Law enforcement authorities must be able to pursue criminal violators, yet, at the same time, there should be reasonable controls imposed to protect the privacy of law-abiding citizens. We support legislation, now pending, to assure this protection. Too many government records, on the other hand, are unnecessarily classified. Congress and the Executive should devise a more reasonable system for classifying and handling government information. The President's achievements in protecting privacy are unequalled by past administrations and must be built upon in the future. We particularly note changes in federal record-keeping systems, the appointment of the Commission on the CIA, the reorganization of the intelligence community and the restriction of White House access to income tax returns. The American Family Families must continue to be the foundation of our nation. Families - not government programs - are the best way to make sure our children are properly nurtured, our elderly are cared for, our cultural and spiritual heritages are perpetuated, our laws are observed and our values are preserved. If families fail in these vitally important tasks, there is little the government, no matter how well-intentioned, can do to remedy the results. Schools cannot educate children adequately if families are not supportive of the learning process. Law enforcement authorities are nearly helpless to curb juvenile delinquency without family cooperation in teaching young people respect for property and laws. Neither medicine nor school feeding programs can replace the family's ability to provide the basis for good health. Isolation from meaningful family contact makes it virtually impossible for the elderly to avoid loneliness or dependence. The values of hard work and responsibility start with the family. As modern life brings changes in our society, it also puts stresses on families trying to adjust to new realities while maintaining cherished values. Economic uncertainty, unemployment, housing difficulties, women's and men's concerns with their changing and often conflicting roles, high divorce rates, threatened neighborhoods and schools, and public scandal all create a hostile atmosphere that erodes family structures and family values. Thus it is imperative that our government's programs, actions, officials and social welfare institutions never be allowed to jeopardize the family. We fear the government may be powerful enough to destroy our families; we know that it is not powerful enough to replace them. Because of our concern for family values, we affirm our beliefs, stated elsewhere in this Platform, in many elements that will make our country a more hospitable environment for family life - neighborhood schools; educational systems that include and are responsive to parents' concerns; estate tax changes to establish more realistic exemptions which will minimize disruption of already bereaved families; a position on abortion that values human life, a welfare policy to encourage rather than discourage families to stay together and seek economic independence; a tax system that assists rather than penalizes families with elderly members, children in day care or children in college; economic and employment policies that stop the shrinkage of our dollars and stimulate the creation of jobs so that families can plan for their economic security . Education Our children deserve quality education . We believe that segregated schools are morally wrong and unconstitutional. However, we oppose forced busing to achieve racial balances in our schools. We believe there are educational advantages for children in attending schools in their own neighborhoods and that the Democrat-controlled Congress has failed to enact legislation to protect this concept. The racial composition of many schools results from decisions by people about where they choose to live. If Congress continues to fail to act, we would favor consideration of an amendment to the Constitution forbidding the assignment of children to schools on the basis of race. Our approach is to work to eradicate the root causes of segregated schools, such as housing discrimination and gerrymandered school districts. We must get on with the education of all our children. Throughout our history, the education of our children has been a community responsibility. But now federal categorical grant programs pressure local school districts into substituting Washington-dictated priorities for their own. Local school administrators and school boards are being turned into bookkeepers for the federal government. Red tape and restrictive regulations stifle imagination and creativity. We are deeply concerned about the decline in the performance of our schools and the decline in public confidence in them. We favor consideration of tax credits for parents making elementary and secondary school tuition payments. Local communities wishing to conduct non-sectarian prayers in their public schools should be able to do so. We favor a constitutional amendment to achieve this end. We propose consolidating federal categorical grant programs into block grants and turning the money over to the states to use in accordance with their own needs and priorities and with minimum bureaucratic controls. A single program must preserve the funding that is directed at the needs of such special groups as the handicapped and the disadvantaged. Primary responsibility for education, particularly on the elementary and secondary levels, belongs to local communities and parents. Intrusion by the federal government must be avoided. Bureaucratic control of schools by Washington has the potential for destruction of our educational system by taking more and more decisions away from parents and local school authorities. Total financial dependence on the federal government inevitably leads to greater centralization of authority. We believe, therefore, that a study should be authorized concerning funding of elementary and secondary education, coupled with a study regarding return to the states of equivalent revenue to compensate for any loss in present levels of federal funding. Unless steps are taken immediately, soaring prices will restrict a college education to the rich and those poor enough to qualify now for government aid. Federal higher education policy should continue to focus on financial aid for needy individuals, but because the financial ability to go to college is fast slipping out of the grasp of middle income families, more realistic eligibility guidelines for student aid are essential . Government interference in the management of colleges and universities must be stopped. Federal support to assist in meeting the grave financial problems of higher education should be forthcoming, but such funds should never be used as devices for imposing added controls. Diversity in education has great value. Public schools and non-public schools should share in education funds on a constitutionally acceptable basis. Private colleges and universities should be assisted to maintain healthy competition and to enrich diversity. The cost of expanding public campuses can be kept down if existing private institutions are helped to accommodate our student population. We favor continued special federal support for vocational education. Health Every American should have access to quality health care at an affordable price. The possibility of an extended illness in a family is a frightening prospect, but, if it does happen, a person should at least be protected from having it wipe out lifetime savings. Catastrophic expenses incurred from major illnesses and accidents affect only a small percentage of Americans each year, but for those people, the financial burden can be devastating. We support extension of catastrophic illness protection to all who cannot obtain it. We should utilize our private health insurance system to assure adequate protection for those who do not have it. Such an approach will eliminate the red tape and high bureaucratic costs inevitable in a comprehensive national program. The Republican Party opposes compulsory national health insurance. Americans should know that the Democrat Platform, which offers a government-operated and financed ""comprehensive national health insurance system with universal and mandatory coverage,"" will increase federal government spending by more than $70-billion in its first full year. Such a plan, could require a personal income tax increase of approximately 20 per cent. We oppose this huge, new health insurance tax. Moreover, we do not believe that the federal government can administer effectively the Democrats' cradle-to-grave proposal. The most effective, efficient and economical method to improve health care and extend its availability to all is to build on the present health delivery and insurance system, which covers nine out of every ten Americans. A coordinated effort should be mounted immediately to contain the rapid increase in health care costs by all available means, such as development of healthier life styles through education, improved preventive care, better distribution of medical manpower, emphasis on out-of-hospital services and elimination of wasteful duplication of medical services. We oppose excessive intrusions from Washington in the delivery of health care. We believe in preserving the privacy that should exist between a patient and a physician, particularly in regard to the confidentiality of medical records. Federal health programs should be consolidated into a single grant to each state, where possible, thereby allowing much greater flexibility in setting local priorities. Our rural areas, for example, have different health care delivery needs than our cities. Federal laws and regulations should respect these differences and make it possible to respond differently to differing needs. Fraud in Medicare and Medicaid programs should be exposed and eliminated. We need a comprehensive and equitable approach to the subject of mental health. Such a program should focus on the prevention, treatment and care of mental illness. It should cover all aspects of the interrelationships between emotional illness and other specific disabilities. The Republican Party applauds the enlightened programs that address mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and other developmental disabilities that seek to remove us from the dark ages in these areas. Alcoholism and drug abuse, growing problems in America today, should receive the utmost attention. While we support valid medical and biological research efforts which can produce life-saving results, we oppose any research on live fetuses. We are also opposed to any legislation which sanctions ending the life of any patient. Child Nutrition Every child should have enough to eat. Good nutrition is a prerequisite of a healthy life. We must focus our resources on feeding needy children. The present school lunch programs provide a 20 per cent subsidy underwrite the meals of children from middle- and upper-income families. The existing 15 child nutrition programs should be concentrated on those children truly in need. Other federal programs should assure that low-income people will be able to purchase a nutritionally adequate food supply. Equal Rights and Ending Discrimination Roadblocks must be removed that maybe prevent Americans from realizing their full potential in society. Unfair discrimination is a burden that intolerably weighs morally, economically and politically upon a free nation. While working to eradicate discriminatory practices, every citizen should be encouraged to take pride in and foster the cultural heritage that has been passed on from previous generations. Almost every American traces ancestry from another country; this cultural diversity gives strength to our national heritage. There must be vigorous enforcement of laws to assure equal treatment in job recruitment, hiring, promotion, pay, credit, mortgage access and housing. The way to end discrimination, however, is not by resurrecting the much discredited quota system and attempting to cloak it in an aura of new respectability. Rather, we must provide alternative means of assisting the victims of past discrimination to realize their full worth as American citizens. Wiping out past discrimination requires continued emphasis on providing educational opportunities for minority citizens, increasing direct and guaranteed loans to minority business enterprises, and affording qualified minority persons equal opportunities for government positions at all levels. Women Women, who comprise a numerical majority of the population, have been denied a just portion of our nation's rights and opportunities. We reaffirm our pledge to work to eliminate discrimination in all areas for reasons of race, color, national origin, age, creed or sex and to enforce vigorously laws guaranteeing women equal rights. The Republican Party reaffirms its support for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. Our Party was the first national party to endorse the E.R.A. in 1940. We continue to believe its ratification is essential to insure equal rights for all Americans. In our 1972 Platform, the Republican Party recognized the great contributions women have made to society as homemakers and mothers, as contributors to the community through volunteer work, and as members of the labor force in careers. The Platform stated then, and repeats now, that the Republican Party ""fully endorses the principle of equal rights, equal opportunities and equal responsibilities for women."" The equal Rights Amendment is the embodiment of this principle and therefore we support its swift ratification. The question of abortion is one of the most difficult and controversial of our time. It is undoubtedly a moral and personal issue but it also involves complex questions relating to medical science and criminal justice. There are those in our Party who favor complete support for the Supreme Court decision which permits abortion on demand. There are others who share sincere convictions that the Supreme Court's decision must be changed by a constitutional amendment prohibiting all abortions. Others have yet to take a position, or they have assumed a stance somewhere in between polar positions. We protest the Supreme Court's intrusion into the family structure through its denial of the parents obligation and right to guide their minor children. The Republican Party favors a continuance of the public dialogue on abortion and supports the efforts of those who seek enactment of a constitutional amendment to restore protection of the right to life for unborn children. The Social Security System, our federal tax laws, and unemployment and disability programs currently discriminate against women and often work against married couples as well. These inequities must be corrected. We recognize that special support must be given to the increasing number of women who have assumed responsibility as the heads of households while also being wage earners. Programs for job training, counseling and other services should be established to help them attain their dual role in society. We reiterate the pledges elsewhere in this platform of support for child care assistance, part-time and flexible-time work that enables men and women to combine employment and family responsibilities, estate tax reform, small business assistance for women, rape prevention and elimination of discriminatory housing practices. Ethnic Americans Ethnic Americans have enriched this nation with their hard work, self-reliance and respect for the rights and needs of others Ethnic groups reaching our shores at various times have given our country its unique identity and strength among the nations of the world. We recognize and value the contributions of Ethnic Americans to our free and democratic society. Hispanic-Americans When language is a cause of discrimination, there must be an intensive educational effort to enable Spanish-speaking students to become fully proficient in English while maintaining their own language and cultural heritage. Hispanic-Americans must not be treated as second-class citizens in schools, employment or any other aspect of life just because English is not their first language. Hispanic-Americans truly believe that individual integrity must be paramount what they want most from government and politics is the opportunity to participate fully. The Republican Party has and always will offer this opportunity. Indians and Alaska Natives We have a unique commitment to Native Americans; we pledge to continue to honor our trust relationship with them, and we reaffirm our federal Indian policy of self-determination without termination. This means moving smoothly and quickly away from federal domination to effective participation and communication by Indians in the political process and in the planning content and administration of federal programs. We shall pursue our joint effort with Indian leaders to assist in the orderly development of Indian and native-owned resources and to continue to attack the severe health, education and unemployment problems which exist among Indians and Alaska Natives. Puerto Rico, The District of Columbia and the Territories The principle of self-determination also governs our positions on Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia as it has in past platforms. We again support statehood for Puerto Rico, if that is the people's choice in a referendum, with full recognition within the concept of a multicultural society of the citizens' right to retain their Spanish language and traditions; and support giving the District of Columbia voting representation in the United States Senate and House of Representatives and full home rule over those matters that are purely local. We will continue to negotiate with the Congress of Micronesia on the future political status of the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands to meet the mutual interests of both parties. We support a plebiscite by the people of American Samoa on whether they wish to elect a territorial governor. We favor whatever action necessary to permit American citizens resident in Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to vote for President and Vice President in national elections. Responsibilities Finally, the most basic principle of all: Achievement and preservation of human rights in our society is based on the willing acceptance by millions of Americans of their responsibilities as free citizens. Instead of viewing government programs with ever increasing expectations, we must readily assume the obligations of wage-earners, taxpayers and supporters of our government institution and laws. This is often forgotten, and so it is appropriate to remind ourselves in this Platform that this is why our society works. Handicapped Citizens Handicapped persons must be admitted into the mainstream of our society. Too often the handicapped population of the nation - over 30 million men, women and children - has been denied the rights taken for granted by other citizens. Time after time, the paths are closed to the handicapped in education, employment, transportation, health care, housing, recreation, insurance, polling booths and due process of law. National involvement is necessary to correct discrimination in these areas. Individual incentive alone cannot do it. We pledge continued attention to the problems caused by barriers in architecture, communication, transportation and attitudes. In addition, we realize that to deny education and employment simply because of an existing disability runs counter to our accepted belief in the free enterprise system and forces the handicapped to be overly dependent on others. Similarly, the denial of equal access to credit and to acquisition of venture capital on the basis of a handicap or other disability conflicts with Republican philosophy. We advocate the elimination of needless barriers for all handicapped persons. Working Americans Free collective bargaining remains the best way to insure that American workers receive a fair price for their labors. The special problems of collective bargaining in state and local government should be addressed at those levels. Washington should not impose its standards on local governments. While we oppose strikes by public employees, we recognize that states have the right to permit them if they choose. Union membership as a condition of employment has been regulated by state law under Section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act. This basic right should continue to be determined by the states. We oppose strikes by federal employees, the unionization of our military forces and the legalization of common-situs picketing. Employees of the federal government should not engage in partisan politics. The Civil Service system must remain nonpartisan and non-political. The Hatch Act now protects federal employees, we insist that it be uniformly administered. Among the rights that are the entitlement of every American worker is the right to join a union - large, small or independent; the right to be protected against racial discrimination and misuse of dues the right to union elections that are fair and democratic; and the right to be assured of ultimately receiving his or her promised pension benefits. Safe and healthful working conditions are goals of utmost importance. We should expect the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to help employers, particularly in small businesses, comply with the law, and we will support legislation providing on-site consultation. There should be considerable concern over the presence of several million illegal aliens in the country who fill jobs that otherwise would be available to American workers. We support increased efforts to deal more effectively with this problem and favor legislation prohibiting employers from knowingly hiring illegal aliens. The Democrat leaders in Congress have systematically killed every attempt to debate this legislation in recent years. Increased part-time and flexible-hour work should be encouraged wherever feasible. In keeping with our belief in family life, we want to expand more opportunities for men and women to combine family responsibilities and employment. Welfare Reform The work of all Americans contributes to the strength of our nation, and all who are able to contribute should be encouraged to do so. In every society there will be some who cannot work, often through no fault of their own. The measure of a country's compassion is how it treats the least fortunate. We appreciate the magnificent variety of private charitable institutions which have developed in the United States. The Democrat-controlled Congress has produced a jumble of degrading, dehumanizing, wasteful, overlapping and inefficient programs failing to assist the needy poor. A systematic and complete overhaul of the welfare system should be initiated immediately. The following goals should govern the reform of the welfare system: (1) Provide adequate living standards for the truly needy; (2) End welfare fraud and prevent it in the future with emphasis on removing ineligible recipients from the welfare rolls, tightening food stamp eligibility requirements, and ending aid to illegal aliens and the voluntarily unemployed; (3) Strengthen work requirements, particularly directed at the productive involvement of able-bodied persons in useful community work projects; (4) Provide educational and vocational incentives to allow recipients to become self-supporting; (5) Better coordinate federal efforts with local and state social welfare agencies and strengthen local and state administrative functions. We oppose federalizing the welfare system; local levels of government are most aware of the needs of their communities. Consideration should be given to a range of options in financing the programs to assure that state and local responsibilities are met. We also oppose the guaranteed annual income concept or any programs that reduce the incentive to work. Those features of the present law, particularly the food stamp program, that draw into assistance programs people who are capable of paying for their own needs should be corrected. The humanitarian purpose of such programs must not be corrupted by eligibility loopholes. Food stamp program reforms proposed by Republicans in Congress would accomplish the twin goals of directing resources to those most in need and streamlining administration. We must never forget that unemployment compensation is insurance, not a welfare program. It should be redesigned to assure that working is always more beneficial than collecting unemployment benefits. The benefits should help most the hard-core unemployed. Major efforts must be encouraged through the private sector to speed up the process of finding jobs for those temporarily out of work. Older Americans Older Americans constitute one of our most valuable resources. Families should be supported in trying to take care of their elderly. Too often government laws and policies contribute to the deterioration of family life. Our tax laws, for example, permit a deduction to the taxpayer who gives a contribution to a charitable institution that might care for an elderly parent, but offer little or no incentive to provide care in the home. If an elderly parent relinquishes certain assets and enters a nursing home, the parent may qualify for full Medicaid coverage, but if parents live with their children, any Supplemental Security Income benefit for which they are eligible may be reduced. Incentives must be written into law to encourage families to care for their older members . Along with loneliness and ill health, older Americans are deeply threatened by inflation. The costs of the basic necessities of life-food, shelter, clothing, health care-have risen so drastically as to reduce the ability of many older persons to subsist with any measure of dignity. In addition to our program for protecting against excessive costs of long-term illness, nothing will be as beneficial to the elderly as the effect of this platform's proposals on curbing inflation. The Social Security benefits are of inestimable importance to the well-being and financial peace-of-mind of most older Americans. We will not let the Social Security system fail. We will work to make the Social Security system actuarily sound. The Social Security program must not be turned into a welfare system, based on need rather than contributions. The cost to employers for Social Security contributions must not be raised to the point where they will be unable to afford contributions to employees' private pension programs. We will work for an increase in the earned income ceiling or its elimination so that, as people live longer, there will not be the present penalty on work. We will also seek to correct those provisions of the system that now discriminate against women and married couples. Such programs as Foster Grandparents and Senior Companions, which provide income exempt from Social Security limitations, should be continued and extended to encourage senior citizens to continue to be active and involved in society. Appropriate domiciliary care programs should be developed to enable senior citizens to receive such care without losing other benefits to which they may be entitled. We favor the abolition of arbitrary levels for mandatory retirement. The Medicare program must be improved to help control inflation in health care costs triggered by present regulation. Other areas of concern to the elderly that need increased attention are home and outpatient care, adequate transportation, nutrition, day care and homemaker care as an alternative to costly institutional treatment. A nation should be judged by its ability to help make all the years of life as productive and gainful as possible. This nation still has a job to do. Veterans The nation must never forget its appreciation and obligation to those who have served in the armed forces. Because they bear the heaviest burdens of war, we owe special honor and compensation to disabled veterans and survivors of the war dead. We are firmly committed to maintaining and improving our Veterans Administration hospital system. Younger veterans, especially those who served in the Vietnam conflict, deserve educational, job and housing loan benefits equivalent to those of World War II and the Korean conflict. Because of our deep and continuing concern for those still listed as Prisoners of War or Missing in Action in Vietnam, the Foreign Policy section of this. Republican Platform calls for top priority actions. And we must continue to provide for our veterans at their death a final resting place for their remains in a national cemetery and the costs of transportation thereto. A National Urban Strategy The decay and decline of communities in this country is not just a physical and economic crisis, but traceable to the decline of a real ""sense of community"" in our society. Community development cannot be achieved merely by throwing dollars and mortar at our community problems; what must be developed is a new sense of mutual concern and responsibility among all members of a community for its improvement. We recognize the family, the neighborhood and the private volunteer sector to be the most basic and vital units within our communities and their central role in revitalizing our communities. We propose a strategy for urban revitalization that both treats our urban areas as social organisms and recognizes that the family is the basic building block in these organisms. Effectively helping our cities now requires a coordinated National Urban policy. The cornerstone of this policy must be to curb inflation. This policy must be based on the principle that the levels of government closest to the cities' problems are best able to respond. Thus federal and state assistance to cities and counties should give the greatest flexibility to those directly on the scene, the local elected officials. Such a policy should replace grant programs - the approach of the Democrat Congress - with block grant programs that allow cities and counties to set their own priorities. Without an urban policy, the Democrat-controlled Congress has created a hodge podge of programs which have all but destroyed our once vital cities. At the same time. urban crime rates have skyrocketed and the quality and promise of metropolitan education systems have plummeted. All this has happened during the years that the number of federal urban programs has increased almost tenfold: from 45 in 1946 to 435 in 1968; and expenditures have increased 3000 per cent: from $1-billion to $30-billion. The Republican programs of revenue sharing and block grants for community development and manpower have already immensely helped our cities and counties. We favor extension of revenue sharing and the orderly conversion of categorical grants into block grants. When federal assistance programs for general purpose local governments are administered through the states, there should be direct pass-through and an effective role for cities and counties in the planning, allocation and use of the funds . Federal, state and local government resources combined are not enough to solve our urban problems. The private sector must he the major participant. Economic development is the best way to involve business and industry; government support should emphasize capital formation and technical assistance for small and minority businesses . We can bring about a new ""birth of freedom"" by following the example of those individuals organizations and community leaders who have successfully solved specific undesirable conditions and problems through private efforts. Government officials should be aware of these successes in developing new approaches to public problems. Financial institutions should be encouraged to participate in the financial requirements of urban development. Each institution should recognize its responsibility in promoting and maintaining economic growth and stability in the central cities. Our urban policies should encourage families and businesses to improve their neighborhoods by means of participation in neighborhood self-help groups, improving and rehabilitating their homes and businesses, and investing in and managing local businesses. We support the revision of federal business assistance programs to encourage joint efforts by local merchants' associations. We need a comprehensive approach to plan, develop and implement a variety of programs which take into account the many diverse needs of each neighborhood. The establishment of a National Neighborhood Policy will signal a commitment to the improvement of the quality of our life in our neighborhoods. We call for an expansion of the President's Committee on Urban Development and Neighborhood Revitalization to include representatives of elected state and local officials and the private sector. Taken together, the thrust of the proposals in this section and in such related areas as housing, transportation, safety and taxes should contribute significantly to again making our cities a pleasant place to live. The Republican National Urban Strategy has been formed in the realization that when the bell tolls for the cities it tolls for all of America. Housing In the United States today we are the best housed nation in the history of world civilization. This accomplishment was achieved by a private enterprise system using free market concepts. All of our citizens should be given the opportunity to live in decent, affordable housing. We believe that we should continue to pursue the primary goal of expanding housing opportunities for all Americans and we should pursue the companion goal of reducing the degree of direct federal involvement in housing. To most Americans the American Dream is a home of their own. The time has come to face some hard realities, primarily that the greatest impediment to decent and affordable housing is inflation. It logically follows that one effective housing program would be simply to elect a Republican Congress which would balance the federal budget. To meet the housing needs of this country there must be a continuous, stable and adequate flow of funds for the purpose of real estate mortgages at realistic interest rates. To continue to encourage home ownership which now encompasses 64 per cent of our families, we support the deductibility of interest on home mortgages and property taxes. We favor the concept of federal revenue sharing and block grants to reduce the excessive burden of the property tax in financing local government. We are concerned with the excessive reliance of financing welfare and public school costs primarily by the property tax. We support inflation-impact studies on governmental regulations, which are inflating housing costs. Current economic problems and environmental concerns must be balanced in each community by a policy of ""Sensible Growth ."" We oppose discrimination in housing, whether by individuals or by institutional financing policies. We urge continued incentives to support the development of low and moderate income housing in order to assure the availability of adequate shelter for the less fortunate. Rehabilitation and preservation of existing housing stock should be given high priority in federal housing policy. We urge the continuation of the self-help restoration of housing, such as urban homesteading, which is providing housing for low-income families. Transportation The federal government has a special responsibility to foster those elements of our national transportation system that are essential to foreign and interstate commerce and national defense. In other transportation systems that primarily support local needs, the federal government's responsibility is to encourage the greatest possible decision-making and flexibility on the part of state and local governments to spend funds in ways that make the best sense for each community. Thus all levels of government have an important role in providing a balanced and coordinated transportation network. In keeping with national transportation goals, the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 has begun the task of removing regulatory constraints of the Interstate Commerce Commission on America's ailing railroads. Now we should carefully assess the need to remove many of the regulatory constraints imposed on the nation's airlines and motor carriers. Consumers pay too high a price for the artificial fare and rate structures imposed by federal regulations. The great Interstate Highway System, initiated by President Eisenhower, has brought new freedom of travel to every American and must be completed and maintained. Our road network should always stress safety through better design as well as bridge maintenance and replacement. We must also have a safe and efficient aviation system capable of responding to the air transportation needs of the future and of reducing exposure to aircraft noise. This includes airport development, navigational and safety facilities, and the design and adequate staffing of advanced air traffic control systems. In airplane use as in other modes of transportation, the impact on the physical environment must always be a basic consideration in federal decisions and such decisions should also include appraisals of impact on the economy. We deplore unfair treatment of United States airlines under foreign landing regulations. Research must be continued to find safe, more fuel-efficient automobile motors and airplanes; safer, faster rail service; and more convenient, less expensive urban transportation. Tax policies should be considered which would stimulate the development and installation of new energy sources in transportation, such as railroad electrification. The disorganization of a Democrat-controlled Congress frustrates the coordination of transportation policy. Currently there are more than 50 congressional subcommittees with independent jurisdiction in the transportation field. This hopelessly disjointed and disorganized approach must be reformed. In keeping with the local goal setting in transportation, the Republican Party applauds the system under which state and local governments can divert funds from interstate highway mileage not essential to interstate commerce or national defense to other, more pressing community needs, such as urban mass transit. We support the concept of a surface transportation block grant which would include the various highway and mass transit programs now in existence. This will provide local elected officials maximum flexibility in selecting and implementing the balanced transportation systems best suited to each locality. It will encompass both capital and operating subsidies for urban mass transit. It will eliminate red tape and over-regulation. We regret that the Democrat-controlled Congress has not adopted such a reform. Energy In 1973, Americans were shocked to discover that a plentiful supply of energy could no longer be assumed. Unfortunately, the Democrat majority in Congress still has not responded to this clear and urgent warning. The United States is now consuming more imported oil than it was three years ago and our dependence on foreign sources has continued to increase to the point where we now import more than 40% of our oil. One fact should now be clear: We must reduce sharply our dependence on other nations for energy and strive to achieve energy independence at the earliest possible date. We cannot allow the economic destiny and international policy of the United States to be dictated by the sovereign powers that control major portions of the world's petroleum supplies. Our approach toward energy self-sufficiency must involve both expansion of energy supply and improvement of energy efficiency. It must include elements that insure increased conservation at all levels of our society. It must also provide incentives for the exploration and development of domestic gas, oil, coal and uranium, and for expanded research and development in the use of solar, geothermal, co-generation, solid waste, wind, water, and other sources of energy. We must use our non-renewable resources wisely while we develop alternative supplies for the future. Our standard of living is directly tied to a continued supply of energy resources. Without an adequate supply of energy, our entire economy will crumble. Unwise government intervention in the marketplace has caused shortage of supply, unrealistic prices and increased dependence on foreign sources. We must immediately eliminate price controls on oil and newly-discovered natural gas in order to increase supply, and to provide the capital that is needed to finance further exploration and development of domestic hydrocarbon reserves. Fair and realistic market prices will encourage sensible conservation efforts and establish priorities in the use of our resources, which over the long run will provide a secure supply at reasonable prices for all. The nation's clear and present need is for vast amounts of new capital to finance exploration, discovery, refining, and delivery of currently usable forms of energy, including the use of coal as well as discovery and development of new sources. At this critical time, the Democrats have characteristically resorted to political demagoguery seeking short-term political gain at the expense of the long-term national interest. They object to the petroleum industry making any profit. The petroleum industry is an important segment of our economy and is entitled to reasonable profits to permit further exploration and development. At the height of the energy crisis, the Republican Administration proposed a strong, balanced energy package directed at both expansion of supply and conservation of energy. The response from the Democrats in Congress was to inhibit expanded production through artificially set price and allocation controls, thereby preventing market forces from working to make energy expansion economically feasible. Now, the Democrats proposed to dismember the American oil industry. We vigorously oppose such divestiture of oil companies - a move which would surely result in higher energy costs, inefficiency and under-capitalization of the industry. Democrats have also proposed that the federal government compete with industry in energy development by creating a national oil company. We totally oppose this expensive, inefficient and wasteful intrusion into an area which is best handled by private enterprise. The Democrats are playing politics with energy. If they are permitted to continue, we will pay a heavy price in lost energy and lost jobs during the decades ahead. Immediate removal of counterproductive bureaucratic redtape will eliminate hindrances to the exploration and development of hydrocarbons and other energy resources. We will accelerate development of oil shale reserves, Alaskan petroleum and the leasing of the Outer Continental Shelf, always within the context of preserving the fullest possible protection for the environment. We will reduce complexity and delays involved in siting, licensing and the regulatory procedures affecting power generation facilities and refineries. Coal, America's most abundant energy resource, is of inestimable value to the American people. It can provide the energy needed to bridge the gap between oil and gas and nuclear and other sources of energy. The uncertainties of governmental regulation regarding the mining, transportation and use of coal must be removed and a policy established which will assure that governmental restraints, other than proper environmental controls, do not prevent the use of coal. Mined lands must be returned to beneficial use. Uranium offers the best intermediate solution to America's energy crisis. We support accelerated use of nuclear energy through processes that have been proven safe. Government research on the use of nuclear energy will be expanded to include perfecting a long-term solution to the problems of nuclear waste. Among alternative future energy sources, fusion, with its unique potential for supplying unlimited clean energy and the promise of new methods of natural resource recovery, warrants continued emphasis in our national energy research program and we support measures to assure adequate capital investment in the development of new energy sources. Environment and Natural Resources A clean and healthy natural environment is the rightful heritage of every American. In order to preserve this heritage, we will provide for proper development of resources, safeguards for clean air and water, and protection and enhancement of our recreation and scenic areas. As our environmental sophistication grows, we must more clearly define the role of the federal government in environmental protection. We believe that it is a national responsibility to support scientific and technological research and development to identify environmental problems and arrives at solutions. We are in complete accord with the recent Supreme Court decision on air pollution that allows the level of government closest to the problem and the solution to establish and apply appropriate air quality standards . We are proud of the progress that the current Republican Administration has made toward bringing pollution of water, land and air under control. We will meet the challenges that remain by stepping up efforts to perfect our understanding of pollutants and the means for reducing their effects. Moreover, as the nation develops new energy sources and technologies, we must insure that they meet safe environmental standards. We renew our commitments to the development of additional water supplies by desalinization, and to the more efficient use and refuse of waters currently available. We are determined to preserve land use planning as a unique responsibility of state and local government. We take particular pride in the expanded use of the National Park system in recent years, and will provide for continued improvement of the national parks and historic sites. We support establishment of a Presidential Panel, including representatives of environmental groups, industry, the scientific community and the public to assist in the development of national priorities on environmental and energy issues. This panel will hear and consider alternative policy recommendations set forth by all of the interested groups, and then develop solutions that represent the overall public interest on environmental and energy matters. One of this nation's greatest assets has been our abundant natural resources which have made possible our strong economic and strategic role in the world. We still have a wealth of resources, but they are not of infinite quantity. We must recognize that our material blessings stem from what we grow in the soil take from the sea, or extract from the ground. We have a responsibility to future generations to conserve our nonrenewable natural resources. Consistent with our needs, conservation should remain our national policy. The vast land holdings of the federal government - approximately one-third of our nation's area - are the lands from which much of our future production of minerals must come. Public lands must be maintained for multiple use management where such uses are compatible. Public land areas should not he closed to exploration for minerals or for mining without an overriding national interest. We believe Americans want their resources developed properly, their environment kept clean and their recreational and scenic areas kept intact. We support appropriate measures to achieve these goals . We also believe that Americans are realistic and recognize that the emphasis on environmental concerns must be brought into balance with the needs for industrial and economic growth so that we can continue to provide jobs for an ever-growing work force. The United States possesses the most productive softwood forests in the world, as well as extensive hardwood forests. Demands for housing, fuel, paper, chemicals and a multitude of other such needs require that these renewable resources be wisely managed on both public and private forest lands - not only to meet these needs, but also to provide for soil conservation, wildlife habitats and recreation. Recognizing that timber is a uniquely renewable resource, we will use all scientifically sound means to maximize Sustained yield, including clear-cutting and replanting where appropriate. We urge the Congress to strengthen the National Forest Service so that it can realize its potential in becoming an effective participant in the reforestation program. We will support broader use of resource recovery and recycling processes through removal of economic disincentives caused by unnecessary government regulation. One of the important issues at stake in the United Nations Law of the Sea Conference is access to the mineral resources in and beneath the sea. Technology, developed by United States industry, is at hand which can unlock resources of petroleum, manganese, nickel, cobalt, copper and other minerals. We will safeguard the national interest in development and use of these resources. Science and Technology Every aspect of our domestic economy and well-being, our international competitive position, and national security is related to our past and present leadership in basic and applied research and the development of our technology. But there can be no complacency about our continued commitment to maintain this leadership position. In the past, most of these accomplishments have been achieved through a unique partnership between government and industry. This must continue and be expanded in the future. Because our society is so dependent upon the advancement of science and the development of technology, it is one of the areas where there must be a central federal policy. We support a national science policy that will foster the public-private partnership to insure that we maintain our leadership role. The national space program plays a pioneer role in exploring the mysteries of our universe and we support its expansion. We recognize that only when our technology is fully distributed can it be assimilated and used to increase our productivity and our standard of living. We will continue to encourage young Americans to study science and engineering. Finally, we support new initiatives to utilize better the recoverable commodities from solid waste materials. We can no longer afford the luxury of a throw-away world. Recycling offers environmental benefits, economic expansion, resource conservation and energy savings. We support a policy which will reward it and economic incentives which will encourage its expansion. Arts and Humanities The arts and humanities offer an opportunity for every American to become a participant in activities that add fullness, expression, challenge and joy to our daily lives. We Republicans consider the preservation of the rich cultural heritages of our various ethnic groups as a priority goal. During our bicentennial year we have celebrated our anniversary with cultural activities as varied and colorful as our cultural heritage. The Republican Party is proud of its record of support to the arts and humanities during the last eight years. We are committed to steadily increase our support through the National Endowments for the nation's museums, theaters, orchestras, dance, opera and film centers as well as for individual artists and writers. This upward trend in funding for the National Arts and Humanities Endowments deserves to continue. But Washington's presence should never dominate; it must remain limited to supporting and stimulating the artistic and cultural lives of each community. We favor continued federal assistance to public broadcasting which provides us with creative educational and cultural alternatives. We recognize that public broadcasting is supported mainly through private sector contributions and commend this policy as the best insurance against political interference. In 1976 we have seen vivid evidence that America's history lives throughout the nation. We support the continued commemoration throughout the bicentennial era by all Americans of those significant events between 1776 and 1789 which contributed to the creation of this nation. We support the efforts of both the public and private sectors, working in partnership, for the historic preservation of the unique and irreplaceable historic sites and buildings. We propose safeguarding the rights of performing artists in the copyright laws, providing tax relief to artists who contribute their own talents and art works for public enjoyment, and encouraging the use of one per cent of the cost of government buildings for art works. Much of the support of the arts and humanities comes from private philanthropy. This generosity should be encouraged by government policies that facilitate charitable donations. Fiscal Responsibility As Republicans, we are proud that in this Platform we have urged tax reductions rather than increased government spending. With firm restraint on federal spending this Platform pledges that its proposals for tax changes - reductions, structural adjustments, differentials, simplifications and job-producing incentives - can all be achieved within the balanced federal budgets we also demand as vital to the interests of all Americans. Without such spending restraint, we cannot responsibly cut back taxes. We reaffirm our determination that any net reduction of revenues must be offset by reduced government spending. Foreign Policy, National Defense and International Economic Policy Prologue The foreign policy of the United States defines the relationships we seek with the world as a whole, with friends and with adversaries. Our policy must be firmly rooted in principle and must clearly express our goals. Our principles cannot be subject to passing whim; they must be true, strong, consistent and enduring. We pledge a realistic and principled foreign policy designed to meet the needs of the nation in the years ahead. The policies we pursue will require an informed consensus; the basis of that consensus will be the American people, whose most cherished desire is to live in freedom and peace, secure from war or threat of war. The United States is a world power with world-wide interests and responsibilities. We pledge the continuation of efforts to revitalize our traditional alliances and to maintain close consultation with our friends. International cooperation and collaboration is required because we can achieve neither our most important objectives nor even our own security in the type of ""splendid isolation"" which is urged upon us by so many strident voices. The regrettable emergence of neo-isolationism often expressed in Congress and elsewhere is detrimental, we believe, to a sound foreign policy . The branches of government can and should work together as the necessary prerequisite for a sound foreign policy. We lament the reckless intrusion of one branch into the clear constitutional prerogative of another. Confronted by so many challenges and so many crises, the United States must again speak with one voice, united in spirit and in fact. We reject partisan and ideological quarrels across party lines and urge Democrats to join with us to lay the foundations of a true bipartisan spirit. Let us speak for this country with one voice, so that our policies will not be misunderstood by our allies or our potential adversaries. Effective policy must rest on promises which are understood and shared, and must be defined in terms of priorities. As the world has changed in a dynamic fashion, so too have our priorities and goals, and so too have the methods of debating and discussing our objectives. When we assumed Executive office eight years ago, we found the national security and foreign policy machinery in shambles. Last-minute reactions to crises were the practice. The National Security Council, so effective under President Eisenhower, had fallen into disuse. As an important first step, the National Security Council machinery was streamlined to cope with the problems of the moment and long-range planning. This restored process allows once again for exhaustive consideration of all the options from which a President must choose. Far from stifling internal debate and dissent as had been the practice in the past, Republican leadership now invites and stimulates evaluation of complex issues in an orderly decision-making process. Republican leadership has also taken steps to report comprehensively its foreign policy and national security objectives. An annual ""State of the World"" message, designed to increase communication with the people and with Congress, has become a permanent part of Presidential practice. A strong and effective program of global public diplomacy is a vital component of U.S. foreign policy. In an era of instant communications. the world is infinitely and forever smaller, and we must have the capacity to communicate to the world-to inform, to explain and to guard against accidental or willful distortion of United States policies. Interdependence has become a fact of international life, linking our actions and policies with those of the world at large. The United States should reach out to other nations to enrich that interdependence. Republican leadership has demonstrated that recognition of the ties that bind us to our friends will serve our mutual interests in a creative fashion and will enhance the chances for world peace. Morality in Foreign Policy The goal of Republican foreign policy is the achievement of liberty under law and a just and lasting peace in the world. The principles by which we act to achieve peace and to protect the interests of the United States must merit the restored confidence of our people. We recognize and commend that great beacon of human courage and morality, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, for his compelling message that we must face the world with no illusions about the nature of tyranny. Ours will be a foreign policy that keeps this ever in mind. Ours will be a foreign policy which recognizes that in international negotiations we must make no undue concessions; that in pursuing detente we must not grant unilateral favors with only the hope of getting future favors in return. Agreements that are negotiated, such as the one signed in Helsinki, must not take from those who do not have freedom the hope of one day gaining it. Finally, we are firmly committed to a foreign policy in which secret agreements, hidden from our people, will have no part. Honestly, openly, and with firm conviction, we shall go forward as a united people to forge a lasting peace in the world based upon our deep belief in the rights of man, the rule of law and guidance by the hand of God. National Defense A superior national defense is the fundamental condition for a secure America and for peace and freedom for the world. Military strength is the path to peace. A sound foreign policy must be rooted in a superior defense capability, and both must be perceived as a deterrent to aggression and supportive of our national interests. The American people expect that their leaders will assure a national defense posture second to none. They know that planning for our national security must be a joint effort by the President and Congress. It cannot be the subject of partisan disputes. It should not be held hostage to domestic political adventurism. A minimum guarantee to preserve freedom and insure against blackmail and threats, and in the face of growing Soviet military power, requires a period of sustained growth in our defense efforts. In constant dollars, the present defense budge will no more than match the defense budge of 1964, the year before a Democrat Administration involved America so deeply in the Vietnam War. In 1975 Soviet defense programs exceeded ours in investment by 85 per cent, exceeded ours in operating costs by 25 per cent, and exceeded ours in research and development by 66 per cent. The issue is whether our forces will be adequate to future challenges. We say they must be. We must always achieve maximum value for each defense dollar spent. Along with the elimination of the draft and the creation, under a Republican President, of all-volunteer armed services, we have reduced the personnel requirements for support functions without affecting our basic posture. Today there are fewer Americans in the uniformed services than at any time since the Fall of 1950. Substantial economies have been made in weapons procurement and we will continue to act in a prudent manner with our defense appropriations. Our national defense effort will include the continuation of the major modernization program for our strategic missile and bomber forces, the development of a new and intercontinental ballistic missile, a new missile launching submarine force and a modern bomber - the B-1 - capable of penetrating the most sophisticated air defenses of the 1980's. These elements will comprise a deterrent of the first order. We will increase our army to 16 divisions, reinforce our program of producing new tanks and other armored vehicles, and support the development of new, highly accurate precision weapons. Our Navy, the guarantor of freedom of the seas, must have a major shipbuilding program, with an adequate balance between nuclear and non-nuclear ships. The composition of the fleet must be based on a realistic assessment of the threat we face, and must assure that no adversary will gain naval superiority. An important modernization program t for our tactical air forces is under way. We will require new fighters and interceptor aircraft for the Air Force, Navy and Marines. As a necessary component of our long-range strategy, we will produce and deploy the B-1 bomber in a timely manner, allowing us to retain air superiority. Our investments in military research: and development are of great importance to our future defense capabilities. We must not lose the vital momentum. With increasing complexity of weapons, lead times for weapons systems are often as long as a decade, requiring careful planning and prudent financial decisions. An outstanding example of this process is the development and deployment of the cruise missile, which incorporates pinpoint precision by means of sophisticated guidance systems and is an exceptionally economical weapon to produce. Security assistance programs are important to our allies and we will continue to strengthen their efforts at self-defense The improvement of their capabilities can help to ensure that the world balance is not tipped against us and can also serve to lessen chances for direct U.S. involvement in remote conflicts. As a vital component of our over-all national security posture, the United States must have the best intelligence system in the world The effectiveness of the intelligence community must be restored, consonant with the reforms instituted by President Ford. We favor the creation of an independent oversight function by Congress and we will withstand partisan efforts to turn any part of our intelligence system into a political football. We will take every precaution to prevent the breakdown of security controls on sensitive intelligence information. endangering the lives of U.S. officials abroad or affecting the ability of the President to act expeditiously whenever legitimate foreign policy and defense needs require it. NATO and Europe Fundamental to a stable, secure world is the continuation of our traditional alliances. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization now approaching the end of its third decade, remains healthy and vigorous . The threat to our mutual security by a totalitarian power bent on expansion brought 15 nations together. The expression of our collective will to resist resulted in the creation and maintenance of a military deterrent which. while not without occasional strains, has served our vital interests well. Today that threat continues. We have succeeded in extending our cooperation within NATO and have taken bold new steps in economic cooperation with our partners. Faced with a serious crisis in the energy field following the imposition of the oil boycott, we demonstrated that it was possible to coordinate our joint activities with the other NATO nations. The economic strength of Western Europe has increased to the point where our NATO partners can now assume a larger share of the common defense; in response to our urging, our allies are demonstrating a greater willingness to do so. This is not the time to recommend a unilateral reduction of American military forces in Europe. We will, however, pursue the balanced reduction of forces in both Western and Eastern Europe, based on agreements which do not Jeopardize the security of the Alliance. With our Alliance partners. we affirm that a strong NATO defense. based on the United States military presence, is vital to the defense of Western Europe. Some of our NATO allies have experienced rapid and dynamic changes. We are encouraged by developments in the Iberian peninsula, where both Portugal and Spain now face more promising futures. Early consideration should be given to Spain's accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. At the same time we would view with concern any political developments elsewhere in Europe which are destabilizing to NATO interests. We support the right of all nations to choose their leaders. Democracy and freedom are best served by ensuring that those fundamental rights are preserved and extended for future generations to choose in freedom. The difficult problem of Cyprus, which separates our friends in Greece and Turkey should be addressed and resolved by those two countries. The eastern flank of NATO requires restored cooperation there and eventually, friendly relations between the two countries. Republican leadership has strengthened this nation's good relations with the European Economic Community in an age of increasing competition and potential irritations. We will maintain and strengthen the excellent relations we have achieved with the EEC. In the final analysis, the NATO Alliance will be as effective as our will and determination, as well as that of our allies, to support it. The function of collective security is to deter wars and, if necessary, to fight and win those wars not successfully deterred. Our vigilance is especially required during periods of prolonged relaxation of tensions with our adversaries because we cannot permit ourselves to accept words and promises as a substitute for deeds. We are determined that the NATO Alliance shall not be lulled into a false sense of security. It can and must respond vigorously when called upon to act. Asia and the Pacific The United States has vital interests in the entire Pacific Basin and those interests lie foremost in Asian tranquility and stability. The experience of ending direct American involvement in a difficult and costly war initiated during Democrat Administrations has taught us a great deal about how we ought to define our interests in this part of the world. The United States is indisputably a Pacific power. We have sought to express our interests in the area through strengthening existing friendly ties and creating new ones. Japan will remain the main pillar of our Asian policy. We have helped to provide the framework, over the course of thirty years, for the development of the Japanese economy, which has risen to second place among free world nations. This nation without natural resources, has maximized its greatest resource, the Japanese people to achieve one of the world's most significant economic advances. We will continue our policy of close consultation and cooperation with this valued friend. We have succeeded in establishing an exceptional relationship with Japan. Our long-range goals of stability and economic cooperation are identical, forming the essential strength of a relationship which both countries seek actively to deepen. With respect to the Republic of Korea a nation with which we have had traditionally close ties and whose economy has grown rapidly in recent years, we shall continue our policy of military and economic assistance. United States troops will be maintained in Korea so long as there exists the possibility of renewed aggression from North Korea. Time has not dimmed our memories of the sudden assault against South Korea. We reaffirm the commitment of the United States to the territorial integrity and the sovereignty of the Republic of Korea. Simultaneously we encourage the Governments of South Korea and North Korea to institute domestic policy initiatives leading to the extension of basic human rights. When Republicans assumed executive office in 1969, we were confronted with a war in Vietnam involving more than 500,000 U.S. troops, and to which we had committed billions of dollars and our national honor and prestige. It was in the spirit of bipartisan support for Presidential foreign policy initiatives, inaugurated in the postwar era by Senator Arthur Vandenberg, that most Republicans support the United States commitment to assist South Vietnam resist Communist-sponsored aggression. The human cost to us was great; more than 55,000 Americans died in that conflict, and more than 300,000 were wounded. A policy of patient, persistent and principled negotiations extricated the United States from that ill-fated war with the expectation that peace would prevail. The refusal of the Democrat-controlled Congress to give support to Presidential requests for military aid to the beleaguered nations of South Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, coupled with sustained military assaults by the Communists in gross violation of the Paris Peace Accords, brought about the collapse of those nations and the subjugation of their people to totalitarian rule. We recognize that there is a wide divergence of opinion concerning Vietnam, but we pledge that American troops will never again be committed for the purpose of our own defense, or the defense of those to whom we are committed by treaty or other solemn agreements, without the clear purpose of achieving our stated diplomatic and military objectives. We must achieve the return of all Americans who may be held in Southeast Asia, and a full accounting for those listed as Missing in Action. We strongly urge continued consultation between the President and the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia. This country owes at least this much to all of these courageous people who have anguished so long over this matter. To this end, and to underscore our top priority commitment to the families of these POWs and MIAs, we recommend, among other actions, the establishment of a Presidential Task Force headed by a special Presidential representative. We condemn the inhumane and criminal retributions which have taken place in Cambodia, where mass executions and forced resettlements have been imposed on innocent civilians. The important economic developments taking place in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and other Asian countries will lead to much improved living standards for the people there. We reaffirm our friendship with these nations. Equally, our relationships with Australia and New Zealand are historic and important to us; they have never been better and provide a firm base on which to build. United States-Chinese Relations A development of significance for the future of Asia and for the world came to fruition in 1972 as our communications were restored with the People's Republic of China. This event has allowed us to initiate dialogue with the leaders of a quarter of the earth's population, and trade channels with the People's Republic have been opened, leading to benefits for each side. The People's Republic of China can and will play an increasingly important role in world affairs. We shall seek to engage the People's Republic of China in an expanded network of contacts and trade. Such a process cannot realistically proceed at a forced or incautious pace; the measured but steady growth of our relations best serves our interests. We do not ignore the profound differences in our respective philosophies, governmental institutions, policies and views on individual liberty, and we are hopeful that basic human rights will be extended to the Chinese people. What is truly fundamental is that we have established regular working channels with the People's Republic of China and that this process can form an important contribution to world peace. Our friendly relations with one great power should not be construed as a challenge to any other nation, large or small. The United States government, while engaged in a normalization of relations with the People's Republic of China, will continue to support the freedom and independence of our friend and ally, the Republic of China, and its 16 million people. The United States will fulfill and keep its commitments, such as the mutual defense treaty, with the Republic of China. The Americas The relations of the United States with the Americas are of vital and immediate importance. How we conduct our affairs with our neighbors to the North and South will continue to be a priority. In the recent past our attention has at times been diverted to more distant parts of the world. There can be no sensible alternative to close relationships and understanding among the nations of this hemisphere. It is time for a series of new departures in our relations with Canada. Canada is our most important trading partner, and we are hers. We, as Americans, feel a deep affinity for our Canadian friends, and we have much at stake in the development of closer relationships based on mutual understanding and complete equality. To our neighbors in Mexico, Central America and South America, we also say that we wish the opportunity to expand our dialogue. The needs of our friends are great, but this must not serve as an obstacle for a concerted effort to work together more closely. The United States has taken steps to adjust tariffs so as to maximize access to our markets. We recognize that our neighbors place no value on complex and cumbersome aid schemes; they see self-help, modernization, and expanded trade as the main sources of economic progress. We will work with them to define specific steps that we can take to help them achieve greater economic strength, and to advance our mutual interests. By continuing its policies of exporting subversion and violence, Cuba remains outside the Inter-American family of nations. We condemn attempts by the Cuban dictatorship to intervene in the affairs of other nations; and, as long as such conduct continues, it shall remain ineligible for admission to the Organization of American States. We shall continue to share the aspirations of the Cuban people to regain their liberty We insist that decent and humane conditions be maintained in the treatment of political prisoners in the Cuban jails, and we will seek arrangements to allow international entities, such as the International Red Cross, to investigate and monitor the conditions in those jails. The present Panama Canal Treaty provides that the United States has jurisdictional rights in the Canal Zone as ""if it were the sovereign."" The United States intends that the Panama Canal be preserved as an international waterway for the ships of all nations. This secure access is enhanced by a relationship which commands the respect of Americans and Panamanians and benefits the people of both countries. In any talks with Panama, however, the United States negotiators should in no way cede, dilute, forfeit, negotiate or transfer any rights, power, authority, jurisdiction, territory or property that are necessary for the protection and security of the United States and the entire Western Hemisphere. We reaffirm our faith in the ability of the Organization of American States, which remains a valuable means of inter-American consultation. The Middle East The preservation of peace and stability in the Middle East is a paramount concern. The efforts of two Republican Administrations, summoning diplomatic and political skills, have been directed toward reduction of tensions and toward avoiding flashpoints which could serve as an excuse for yet another round of conflict between Israel and the Arab countries. Our commitment to Israel is fundamental and enduring. We have honored and will continue to honor that commitment in every way - politically, economically and by providing the military aid that Israel requires to remain strong enough to deter any potential aggression. Forty per cent of all United States' aid that Israel has received since its creation in 1948 has come in the last two fiscal years, as a result of Republican initiatives. Our policy must remain one of decisive support for the security and integrity of Israel. An equally important component of our commitment to Israel lies in continuing our efforts to secure a just and durable peace for all nations in that complex region. Our efforts have succeeded, for the first time since the creation of the state of Israel in moving toward a negotiated peace settlement which would serve the interests and the security of all nations in the Middle East. Peace in the Middle East now requires face-to-face, direct negotiations between the states involved with the recognition of safe, secure and defensible borders for Israel. At the same time, Republican Administrations have succeeded in reestablishing communication with the Arab countries, and have made extensive progress in our diplomatic and commercial relations with the more moderate Arab nations . As a consequence of the Middle East convict of 1973, the petroleum producing states imposed an embargo on the export of oil to most of the advanced industrial countries. We have succeeded in creating numerous cooperative mechanisms to protect ourselves, working in concert with our allies, against any future embargoes. The United States would view any attempt to reimpose an embargo as an essentially hostile act. We will oppose discriminatory practices, including boycotts of any type. Because we have such fundamental interests in the Middle East, it will be our policy to continue our efforts to maintain the balance of power in the Mediterranean region. Our adversaries must recognize that we will not permit a weakening of our defenses or any attempt to disturb valued Alliance relationships in the Eastern Mediterranean . We shall continue to support peace initiatives in the civil war in Lebanon; United States envoys engaged in precisely such an initiative were murdered, and we express our sorrow for their untimely deaths and for all other dedicated government employees who have been slain elsewhere while in service to their country. In Lebanon, we stand ready to provide food, medical and other humanitarian assistance. Africa The United States has always supported the process of self-determination in Africa. Our friendship for the African countries is expressed in support for continued peaceful economic development, expansion of trade, humanitarian relief efforts and our belief that the entire continent should be free from outside military intervention. Millions of Americans recognize their historical and cultural ties with Africa and express their desire that United States policy toward Africa is a matter of great importance. We support all forces which promote negotiated settlements and racial peace. We shall continue to deplore all violence and terrorism and to urge all concerned that the rights of tribal, ethnic and racial minorities be guaranteed through workable safeguards. Our policy is to strengthen the forces of moderation, recognizing that solutions to African problems will not come quickly. The peoples of Africa can coexist in security, work together in freedom and harmony, and strive together to secure their prosperity. We hope that the Organization of African Unity will be able to achieve mature and stable relationships within Africa and abroad. The interests of peace and security in Africa are best served by the absence of arms and greater concentration on peaceful development. We reserve the right to maintain the balance by extending our support to nations facing a threat from Soviet-supplied states and from Soviet weapons. United States-Soviet Relations American foreign policy must be based upon a realistic assessment of the Communist challenge in the world. It is clear that the perimeters of freedom continue to shrink throughout the world in the face of the Communist challenge. Since 1917, totalitarian Communism has managed through brute force, not through the free electoral process, to bring an increasingly substantial portion of the world's land area and peoples under its domination. To illustrate, most recently South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos have fallen under the control of Communist dictatorships, and in that part of the world the Communist pressure mounts against Thailand, the Republic of China, and the Republic of Korea. In Africa, Communist Cuban forces, brazenly assisted by the Soviet Union, have recently imposed a Communist dictatorship upon the people of Angola. Other countries in Africa and throughout the world generally await similar fates. These are the realities of world power in our time. The United States is thoroughly justified in having based its foreign policy upon these realities. Thirty years ago relations between the United States and the Soviet Union were in a phase of great difficulty, leading to the tensions of the Cold War era. Although there have been changes in this crucial superpower relationship, there remain fundamental and profound differences between us. Republican Presidents, while acknowledging the depth of the gulf which separates our free society from Soviet society, have sought methodically to isolate and develop those areas of our relations which would serve to lessen tension and reduce the chance of unwanted conflict. In a world beset by countless opportunities for discord and armed conflict, the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is critically important; on it rests the hopes of the world for peace. We offer a policy that maintains our fundamental strength and demonstrates our steadfast determination to prevent aggressive use of Soviet power. The role of a responsible, participating Congress in maintaining this diplomatic and military posture is critical to success. The United States must remain a loyal and dependable ally, and must be prepared to carry out commitments and to demonstrate a willingness to act. Resistance to open aggression, such as the Soviet-sponsored Cuban intervention in Angola, must not be allowed to become the subject of a partisan debate, nor can it be allowed to become an unchallenged and established pattern of international behavior, lest our credibility and deterrent strength be greatly diminished . Soviet military power has grown rapidly in recent years, and while we shall prevent a military imbalance or a sudden shift in the global balance of power, we shall also diligently explore with the Soviet Union new ways to reduce tensions and to arrive at mutually beneficial and self-enforcing agreements in all fields of international activity. Important steps have been taken to limit strategic nuclear arms. The Vladivostok Agreement of November 19t4 placed a ceiling on the strategic forces of both the United States and the Soviet Union. Further negotiations in arms control are continuing. We shall not agree for the sake of agreement; on the contrary we will make sure that any agreements yield fundamental benefits to our national security. As an example of hardheaded bargaining, our success in concluding agreements limiting the size of peaceful nuclear explosions and nuclear weapons tests will, for the first time, permit the United States to conduct on-site inspections in the Soviet Union itself. This important step can now be measured in practical terms. All such agreements must stand the test of verification. An agreement that does not provide this safeguard is worse than no agreement at all. We support the consolidation of joint efforts with our allies to verify that our policies regarding the transfer of technology to the Soviet Union and its allies are in concert and that consultation will be designed to preclude the sale of those technology-intensive products to the Soviet Union by the United States and our allies which will directly or indirectly jeopardize our national security. Our trade in nonstrategic areas creates jobs here at home, substantially improves our balance-of-payments position, and can contribute to an improved political climate in the world. The overseas sale of our agricultural products benefits American farmers and consumers. To guard against any sudden shift in domestic prices as the consequence of unannounced purchases, we have instituted strict reporting procedures and other treaty safeguards. We shall not permit concessional sales of agricultural products to the Soviet Union, nor shall we permit the Soviet Union or others to determine our agricultural export policies by irregular and unpredictable purchases. The United States and the Soviet Union remain ideological competitors. We do not shrink from such a challenge; rather, we welcome the opportunity to demonstrate that our way of life is inherently preferable to regimentation and government-enforced orthodoxy. We shall expect the Soviet Union to implement the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights and the Helsinki Agreements, which guarantee the conditions for the free interchange of information and the right to emigrate, including emigration of Soviet Jews, Christians, Moslems and others who wish to join close relatives abroad. In this spirit we shall expect the immediate end of all forms of harassment, including imprisonment and military service, aimed at preventing such emigration. America must take a firm stand to bring about liberalization of emigration policy in countries which limit or prohibit free emigration. Governments which enjoy the confidence of their people need have no fear of cultural, intellectual or press freedom. Our support for the people of Central and Eastern Europe to achieve self-determination will continue. Their ability to choose their future is of great importance to peace and stability. We favor increasing contact between Eastern and Western Europe and support the increasing economic ties of all the countries of Europe. We strongly support the continuation of the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty with adequate appropriations. Strict reciprocity must govern our diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. We express our concern for the safety of our diplomatic representatives in the Soviet Union, and we insist that practices such as microwave transmissions directed at the United States Embassy be terminated immediately. Thus our relations with the Soviet Union will be guided by solid principles. We will maintain our strategic and conventional forces; we will oppose the deployment of Soviet power for unilateral advantages or political and territorial expansion; we will never tolerate a shift against us in the strategic balance; and we will remain firm in the face of pressure, while at the same time expressing our willingness to work on the basis of strict reciprocity toward new agreements which will help achieve peace and stability. International Cooperation Strong support for international cooperation in all fields has been a hallmark of United States international policy for many decades. Two Republican Administrations have strengthened agencies of international cooperation not only because of our humanitarian concern for others, but also because it serves United States interests to be a conscientious member of the world community. The political character of the United Nations has become complex. With 144 sovereign members, the U.N. experiences problems associated with a large, sometimes cumbersome and diverse body. We seek to accommodate to these changes in the spirit of friendly concern, but when the United Nations becomes arrayed against the vital interest of any of its member states on ideological or other narrow grounds, the very principles of the organization are threatened. The United States does not wish to dictate to the U.N., yet we do have every right to expect and insist that scrupulous care be given to the rights of all members. Steamroller techniques for advancing discriminatory actions will be opposed. Actions such as the malicious attempt to depict Zionism as a form of racism are inconsistent with the objectives of the United Nations and are repugnant to the United States. The United States will continue to be a firm supporter and defender of any nation subjected to such outrageous assaults. We will not accept ideological abuses in the United States. In the many areas of international cooperation which benefit the average American - elimination of terrorism, peacekeeping, nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, termination of the international drug trade, and orderly use of ocean resources - we pledge to build new international structures of cooperation. At the same time, we shall seek to insure that the cost of such new structures, as well as the cost of existing structures, are more equitably shared among participating nations. In the continued tradition of American concern for the quality of human life everywhere, we shall give vigorous support to the non-political work of the specialized agencies of the United Nations which deal with such areas as nutrition and disaster relief for the world's poor and disadvantaged. The United States should promptly withdraw from the International Labor Organization if that body fails to stop its increasing politicization. Eight years ago we pledged to eliminate waste and to make more business-like the administration of United States foreign aid programs. We have endeavored to fulfill these pledges. Our foreign economic assistance programs are now being operated efficiently with emphasis on helping others to help themselves, on food production and rural development, on health programs and sound population planning assistance, and on the development of human resources. We have sought to encourage others, including the oil producing countries, to assume a larger share of the burden of assistance. We shall continue our efforts to secure adequate sources of financing for economic projects in emerging countries. The world's oceans, with their vast resources, must become areas of extended cooperation. We favor a successful conclusion to the Law of the Sea Conference provided it will suitably protect legitimate national interests, freedom of the seas and responsible use of the seas. We are determined to maintain the right of free and unmolested passage for ships of all nations on the high seas and in international waterways. We favor an extension of the territorial sea from three to twelve miles, and we favor in principle the creation of a 200 mile economic zone in which coastal states would have exclusive rights to explore and develop natural resources. We strongly condemn illegal corporate payments made at home and abroad. To eliminate illegal payments to foreign officials by American corporations, we support passage of President Ford's proposed legislation and the OECD Declaration on Investment setting forth reasonable guidelines for business conduct. The growth of civilian nuclear technology, and the rising demand for nuclear power as an alternative to increasingly costly fossil fuel resources, combine to require our recognition of the potential dangers associated with such developments. All nations must work to assure that agreements and treaties currently governing nuclear technology and nuclear exports are carefully monitored. We shall work to devise new multilateral policies governing the export of sensitive nuclear technologies. International Economic Policy The tumultuous events of the past several years in the world economy were an enormous challenge to our creativity and to our capacity for leadership. We have emerged from this difficult period in a new position in the world, and we have directed and guided a sound recovery. To assure the permanence of our own prosperity, we must work with others demonstrating our leadership and the vitality of our economy. Together with the industrial democracies, we must ensure steady, non-inflationary growth based on expanded international cooperation. The Republican Administration will cooperate fully in strengthening the international trade and monetary system, which provides the foundation for our prosperity and that of all nations. We shall bargain hard to remove barriers to an open economic system, and we shall oppose new restrictions to trade. We shall continue to represent vigorously our nation's economic interests in the trade negotiations taking place in Geneva, guard against protectionism, and insist that the principles of fair trade be scrupulously observed. When industries and jobs are adversely affected by foreign competition, adjustment assistance under the Trade Act of 1974 is made available. This Act must be under continuous review to ascertain that it reflects changing circumstances. The Republican Party believes that cooperation in the energy field is indispensable to international stability. Most of the industrial democracies and the less developed countries are increasingly dependent on imported oil, which causes them to be politically, economically and strategically vulnerable. Through the establishment of the International Energy Agency, steps have been taken to expand consumer cooperation. We shall also continue the dialogue with the oil producing countries We shall continue to work closely with the less-developed countries to promote their economic growth. Those countries will be encouraged to enter into mutually beneficial trade relationships with us that contribute to world peace. To achieve this, we must strengthen the confidence of the major industrial countries as they take part in discussions with less-developed countries. There is no reason for us to be defensive; our combined assets can be used in a coordinated strategy to make our influence effective. We will not yield to threats or confrontational politics. While we shall support a global increase of investment in natural resources of all types, we shall also oppose the replacement of the free market mechanism by cartels, price-fixing arrangements or commodity agreements. We shall continue policies designed to assure free market consumers abroad that the United States will remain a dependable supplier of agricultural commodities. Conclusion The American people can be proud of our nation's achievements in foreign policy over the past 8 years. We are at peace. We are strong. We re-emphasize the importance of our ties with the nations of the Americas. Our relations with allies in the Atlantic community and with Japan have never been closer. Significant progress has been made toward a just and durable settlement in the Middle East. We have sought negotiation rather than confrontation with our adversaries, while maintaining our strategic deterrent. The world economic recovery, led by the United States, is producing sustainable growth. In this year of our nation's bicentennial, the American people have confidence in themselves and are optimistic about the future. We, the Republican Party, proudly submit our record and our platform to you.",132209,20508,"preamble to you, an american citizen: you are about to read the republican platform. we hope you will also find time to read the democrats' platform. compare you will see basic differences in how the two parties propose to represent you . ""the platform is the party's contract with the people."" this is what it says on the cover of the official printing of the democrat platform. so it should be. the democrats' platform repeats the same thing on every page: more government, more spending, more inflation. compare. this republican platform says exactly the opposite - less government, less spending, less inflation. in other words, we want you to retain more of your own money, money that represents the worth of your labors, to use as you see fit for the necessities and conveniences of life. no matter how many statements to the contrary that mr. carter makes, he is firmly attached to a contract with you to vastly increase the powers of government. is bigger government in washington really what you want? make no mistake: you cannot have bigger programs in washington and less government by washington. you must choose. what is the cost of these added or expanded programs? the democrats' platform is deliberately vague. when they tell you, as they do time after time, that they will ""expand federal support,"" you are left to guess the cost. the price tag of five major democrat platform promises could add as much as $-billion to the annual cost of government. but the democrats' platform proposes over new or expanded spending programs and the expansion or creation of some washington agencies, offices or bureaus. in fact, the total of all democrat proposals can be as high as $-billion a year while this must be a rough estimate, it does give you a clue to the magnitude and direction of these commitments: the democrats' platform can increase federal spending by percent. if a democrat congress passes the democrat platform and it is signed by a democrat president, what happens then? the democrats could raise your taxes by per cent to pay for the new programs or the democrats could not raise taxes and the result would be a runaway inflation. of course, contract or no contract, the democrats may not honor their promises, are you prepared to risk it? in stark contrast to the democrats' platform, we offer you a responsive and moderate alternative based on these principles: - we believe that liberty can be measured by how much freedom you have to make your own decisions - even your own mistakes. government must step in when your liberties impinge on your neighbors. government must protect your constitutional rights. government must deal with other governments and protect you from aggressors. government must assure equal opportunity. and government must be compassionate in caring for those citizens who are unable to care for themselves. - our federal system of local-state-national government is designed to sort out on what level these actions should be taken. those concerns of a national character - such as air and water pollution that do not respect state boundaries or the national transportation system or efforts to safeguard your civil liberties - must, of course, be handled on the national level. - as a general rule, however, we believe that government action should be taken first by the government that resides as close to you as possible. governments tend to become less responsive to your needs the farther away they are from you. thus, we prefer local and state government to national government, and decentralized national government wherever possible. - we also believe that you, often acting through voluntary organizations, should have the opportunity to solve many of the social problems of your community. this spirit of freely helping others is uniquely american and should be encouraged in every way by government. - every dollar spent by government is a dollar earned by you. government must always ask: are your dollars being wisely spent? can we afford it? is it not better for the country to leave your dollars in your pocket? - your elected officials, their appointees, and government workers are expected to perform their public acts with honesty, openness, diligence, and special integrity. at the heart of our system must be confidence that these people are always working for you. - we believe that your initiative and energy create jobs, our standard of living and the underlying economic strength of the country. government must work for the goal of justice and the elimination of unfair practices, but no government has yet designed a more productive economic system or one which benefits as many people . - the beauty of our land is our legacy to our children. it must be protected by us so that they can pass it on intact to their children . - the united states must always stand for peace and liberty in the world and the rights of the individual. we must form sturdy partnerships with our allies for the preservation of freedom. we must be ever willing to negotiate differences, but equally mindful that there are american ideals that cannot be compromised. given that there are other nations with potentially hostile designs, we recognize that we can reach our goals only while maintaining a superior national defense that is second to none. we support these principles because they are right, knowing full well that they will not be easy to achieve. acting with restraint is most difficult when confronted by an opposition congress that is determined to promise everything to everybody. and this is what the democrat congress has been doing. a document, such as this platform, which refuses to knuckle under to special interest groups, will be accused of being ""uncaring."" yet it is exactly because we do care about your basic freedom to manage your own life with a minimum of government interference, because we do care about encouraging permanent and meaningful jobs, because we do care about your getting paid in sound dollars, because we do care about resisting the use of your tax dollars for wasteful or unproven programs-it is for these reasons that we are proposing only actions that the nation can afford and are opposing excessive tinkering with an economic system-that works better than any other in the world. our great american republic was founded on the principle: ""one nation under god, with liberty and justice for all."" this bicentennial year marks the anniversary of the greatest secular experiment in history: that of seeking to determine that a people are truly capable of self-government: it was our ""declaration"" which put the world and posterity on notice ""that all men are...endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights"" and that those rights must not be taken from those to whom god has given them. recently, peggy pinder, a -year-old student from grinnell, iowa, who is a delegate to this convention, said that she joined our party ""because republicans understand the place of government in the people's lives better than the democrats. republicans try to find ways to take care of needs through the private sector first while it seems automatic for democrats to take care of them through the governmental system ."" the perception of peggy pinder governs this platform. aren't these the principles that you want your elected representatives to have? jobs and inflation we believe it is of paramount importance that the american people understand that the number one destroyer of jobs is inflation. we wish to stress that the number one cause of inflation is the government's expansion of the nation's supply of money and credit needed to pay for deficit spending. it is above all else deficit spending by the federal government which erodes the purchasing power of the dollar. most republicans in congress seem to understand this fundamental cause-and-effect relationship and their support in sustaining over presidential vetoes in the past two years has prevented over $-billion in federal spending. it is clear that most of the democrats do not understand this vital principle, or, if they do, they simply don't care. inflation is the direct responsibility of a spendthrift democrat-controlled congress that has been unwilling to discipline itself to live within our means. the temptation to spend and deficit spend for political reasons has simply been too great for most of our elected politicians to resist. individuals, families, companies and most local and state governments must live within a budget. why not congress? republicans hope every american realizes that if we are to permanently eliminate high unemployment, it is essential to protect the integrity of our money. that means putting an end to deficit spending. the danger, sooner or later, is runaway inflation. wage and price controls are not the solution to inflation. they attempt to treat only the symptom - rising prices - not the cause. historically, controls have always been a dismal failure, and in the end they create only shortages, black markets and higher prices. for these reasons the republican party strongly opposes any reimposition of such controls, on a standby basis or otherwise. unfortunately, the democrat-controlled congress now persists in attempting to obtain control over our nation's money creation policies by taking away the independence of the federal reserve board. the same people who have so massively expanded government spending should not be allowed politically to dominate our monetary policy. the independence of the federal reserve system must be preserved. massive, federally-funded public employment programs, such as the humphrey-hawkins bill currently embraced by the new national platform of the democrat party will cost billions and can only be financed either through very large tax increases or through ever increasing levels of deficit spending. although such government ""make-work"" programs usually provide a temporary stimulus to the economy, ""quick-fix"" solutions of this sort - like all narcotics - lead to addiction, larger and larger doses, and ultimately the destruction of far more jobs than they create sound job creation can only be accomplished in the private sector of the economy. americans must not be fooled into accepting government as the employer of last resort. nor should we sit idly by while . million american jobs are threatened by imports of textile products. we encourage the renewal of the gatt multifiber arrangement and the signing of other necessary bilateral agreements to protect our domestic textile industry. in order to be able to provide more jobs, businesses must be able to expand; yet in order to build and expand, they must be profitable and able to borrow funds (savings) that someone else has been willing to part with on a temporary basis. in the long run, inflation discourages thrift, encourages debt and destroys the incentive to save which is the mainspring of capital formation. when our government - through deficit spending and debasement of the currency - destroys the incentive to save and to invest, it destroys the wellspring of american productivity. obviously, when production falls, the number of jobs decline. the american people are beginning to understand that no government can ever add real wealth (purchasing power) to an economy by simply turning on the printing presses or by creating credit out of thin air. all government can do is confiscate and redistribute wealth. no nation can spend its way into prosperity; a nation can only spend its way into bankruptcy. taxes and government spending the republican party recognizes that tax policies and spending policies are inseparable. if government spending is not controlled, taxes will inevitably rise either directly or through inflation. by failing to tie spending directly to income, the democrat-controlled congress has not kept faith with the american people. every american knows he cannot continually live beyond his means. the republican party advocates a legislative policy to obtain a balanced federal budget and reduced tax rates. while the best tax reform is tax reduction, we recognize the need for structural tax adjustments to help the working men and women of our nation. to that end, we recommend tax credits for college tuition, post-secondary technical training and child care expenses incurred by working parents. over the past two decades of democrat-control of the congress, our tax laws have become a nightmare of complexity and unfair tax preferences, virtually destroying the credibility of the system. simplification should be a major goal of tax reform . we support economic and tax policies to insure the necessary job-producing expansion of our economy. these include hastening capital recovery through new systems of accelerated depreciation, removing the tax burden on equity financing to encourage more capital investment, ending the unfair double taxation of dividends, and supporting proposals to enhance the ability of our working and other citizens to own ""a piece of the action"" through stock ownership. when balanced by expenditure reductions, the personal exemption should be raised to $,. agriculture and rural development the bounty of our farms is so plentiful that we may tend to forget what an amazing production achievement this really is. the american farmer and rancher produces enough food to feed over people-a threefold increase in productivity in years. rural america must be maintained as a rewarding place to live. to accomplish this, our rural areas are entitled to services comparable to their urban neighbors, such as water and sewer systems, improved electricity and telephone service, adequate transportation, available and adequate financial credit, and employment opportunities which will allow small farmers to supplement their incomes. farm exports have continued to expand under the policies of this republican administration - from a low of $-billion in , the last democrat year, to $ billion in . these exports are not giveaway programs, most are earning dollars from the marketplaces of the world, establishing a favorable balance of trade and a higher standard of living for all. through our farm exports we fight the problem of world hunger, especially with the humanitarian food for peace program (public law ) of the eisenhower administration and the republican-controlled congress of . republican farm policy has permitted farmers to use their crop land fully. we are at last moving toward making effective use of our superb resources. net farm income from through averaged $-billion, more than double the average of the 's. government should not dictate to the productive men and women who work the land. to assure this, we support the continuation of the central principles of the agricultural act of , with adjustments of target prices and loan levels to reflect increased production costs. we oppose government-controlled grain reserves, just as we oppose federal regulations that are unrealistic in farm practices, such as those imposed by the occupational safety and health administration (osha) and the environmental protection agency (epa). we urge prompt action by congress in amending the grain inspection act to strengthen the present inspection system and restore its integrity. we firmly believe that when the nation asks our farmers to go all out to produce as much as possible for world-wide markets, the government should guarantee them unfettered access to those markets. our farmers should not be singled out by export controls. also, when a foreign nation subsidizes its farm exports, our farmers deserve a protection against such unfair practices. the federal government should assure that foreign imported commodities are equal in quality to our domestic commodities. nations from whom we buy commodities should not be allowed to circumvent import restriction laws, such as the meat import quota act of . we recognize the importance of the multilateral trade negotiations now in progress and urge our representatives to obtain the most beneficial agreements for our farmers and the nation's economy. in order to assure the consumers of america an uninterrupted source of food, it is necessary to pass labor relations legislation which is responsive to the welfare of workers and to the particular needs of ford production. such legislation should recognize the need to prevent work stoppages during critical harvest periods. we must help farmers protect themselves from drought, flood and other natural disasters through a system of all-risk crop insurance through federal government reinsurance of private insurance companies combined with the existing disaster payment program. as in , we urge prompt passage of the republican-sponsored legislation now pending in congress which will increase the estate tax exemption to $,, allow valuation of farm property on a current use basis and provide for extension of the time of payment in the case of farms and small businesses this overdue estate and gift tax legislation must be approved this year. we favor a liberalized marital deduction and oppose capital gains tax at death. innovations in agriculture need to be encouraged by expanding research programs including new pest and predator control measures, and utilization of crops as a new energy resource, if we expect our farmers to produce an abundant food supply, they must have all the energy they need to produce, market and process their crops and livestock. we continue to support farmer cooperatives, including rural electric and telephone cooperatives, in their efforts to improve services to their members. we support the capper-volstead act. we believe that non-farm corporations and tax-loss farming should be prevented from unfairly competing against family farms, which we support as the preferred method of farm organization. since farmers are practicing conservationists, they should not be burdened with unrealistic environmental regulations. we are concerned about regulations issued by the army corps of engineers that will regulate all ""routine"" agricultural and forestry activities on ""all"" our waters and wetland, and support legislation to exempt routine farming operations from these requirements. the adjudication of water rights should be a matter of state determination. small business small business, so vital to our economic system, is free enterprise in its purest sense. it holds forth opportunity to the individual, regardless of race or sex, to fulfill the american dream. small businesses are the base of our economy and its main source of strength. some . million small firms generate per cent of our private employment-or the livelihood of over million americans. yet while small businesses have a unique place in our society, they also have unique problems that government must address. therefore, we recommend that the small business administration (sba): - assure adequate financing to those credit worthy firms that cannot now obtain funds through conventional channels; - include the proper mix of loan programs to meet the needs of the many different types of firms that constitute the american small business community; - serve as an aggressive advocate for small business and provide procurement, management and technological assistance. for survival, small businesses must have relief from the overwhelming burden placed on them by many regulatory bodies. paperwork proliferation has grown out of control, and small business is not equipped to deal with this aggravation. the present tax structure does not allow small firms to generate enough capital to grow and create jobs. estate taxes need liberalization to benefit the family business in the same manner as for the family farm. encouraging investment in small businesses through more equitable tax treatment remains the best and least expensive method of creating productive employment. the republican party, recognizing that small and independent business is the backbone of the american competitive system, pledges itself to strengthen this vital institution. antitrust the republican party believes in and endorses the concept that the american economy is traditionally dependent upon fair competition in the marketplace. to assure fair competition, antitrust laws must treat all segments of the economy equally. vigorous and equitable enforcement of antitrust laws heightens competition and enables consumers to obtain the lowest possible price in the marketplace. bureaucratic overregulation we believe that the extent of federal regulation and bureaucratic interference in the lives of the american people must be reduced. the programs and activities of the federal government should be required to meet strict tests of their usefulness and effectiveness. in particular, we consider essential an analysis of the extensive growth of laws and regulations governing production processes and conditions and standards for consumer products, so as to determine whether the services and benefits the american people receive are worth the price they are paying for these services in higher taxes and consumer prices. we are intensely aware of the need to protect our environment and provide safe working conditions in american industry, while at the same time preventing the loss of jobs and the closing of small businesses through unrealistic or over-rigorous government regulations. we support a balanced approach that considers the requirements of a growing economy and provides jobs for american workers. the average businessman and employer is being overwhelmed by government-required paperwork. we support legislation to control and reduce the burden of federal paperwork, particularly that generated by the internal revenue service and the census bureau. government that works we believe that americans are fed up with and frustrated by national government that makes great promises and fails to deliver. we are. we think that democrat congresses - in control for out of years - are the grand masters of this practice. we think that national government that has grown so big that the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing has also caused the condition we are in. what we now have is a government organization that doesn't make any sense. it has not developed by design. it just grew - by whim, bureaucratic fighting, and the caving in of democratic congresses to special interest demands. so today we find that nine federal departments and independent agencies are involved in education; seven departments and eight agencies in health; federal recreation areas are administered by six agencies in three departments, and so forth. what we need is a top-to-bottom overhaul. two high level presidential commissions under two presidents - one a democrat, one a republican - have investigated and come up with the same answer: there must be functional realignment of government, instead of the current arrangement by subject areas or constituencies . we want federal domestic departments to reflect the major purposes of government, such as natural resources, human resources, community development and the economic affairs. unfortunately, the democrat congress has refused to address this problem. now we insist that attention must be paid. too often in the past, we have been content with organizational or procedural solutions to complex economic and social regulatory problems. we should no longer accept rhetoric as a substitute for concrete results. the president has proposed to congress the agenda for government reform act, which would guarantee the systematic re-examination and reform of all federal regulatory activities within the next four years. this legislation requires congress and the president to agree to undertake an exhaustive reassessment of the combined effects of all government regulations, and it requires them to adhere to a disciplined timetable to assure annual results. the american people deserve no less. every agency of government must be made efficient, and every government regulation should be subjected to cost benefit analysis. the occupational safety and health administration (osha) is a typical example of a well-intentioned regulatory effort which has imposed large costs but has not solved our problems. the beauty of america's original concept of government was its diversity, the belief that different purposes are best served by governments at different levels. in our lifetime, however, democrat congresses have allowed this system to become warped and over-nationalized. as powers have flowed to washington, the ability to attend to our problems has often dried up in our communities and states. this trend must be reversed. local government is simply more accountable to the people, and local people are perfectly capable of making decisions. we reaffirm the long standing principle of the republican party that the best government is the one closest to the people. it is less costly, more accountable, and more responsive to the people's needs. our confidence in the people of this nation was demonstrated by initiating the revenue sharing program. to date, $-billion of federal tax dollars have been returned to the states and localities. this program is administered with fewer than people and a computer. revenue sharing is an effort to reverse the trend toward centralization. revenue sharing must continue without unwarranted federal strictures and regulations. as a further step in this direction, the republicans in congress promoted the new concept of federal block grants to localities for much greater flexibility. under block grants, federal funds can be tailored by the states and localities to the wishes of each community. there are now two block grant programs - in community development and employment training. block grant programs should be extended to replace many existing categorical health, education, child nutrition and social programs. the democrat congress stands guilty of failing to enact these vital reforms. our ultimate goal is to restore taxing and spending to the local level. the republican party has always believed that the proper role of government is to do only those things which individuals cannot do for themselves. we encourage individual initiative and oppose the trend of ever expanding government programs which is destroying the volunteer spirit in america. we firmly believe that community involvement is essential to the development of effective solutions to the problems confronting our country. while we oppose a uniform national primary, we encourage the concept of regional presidential primaries, which would group those states which voluntarily agree to have presidential primaries in a geographical area on a common date. we encourage full participation in our electoral process. we further recognize the sanctity and value of the ballot. in that regard, we oppose ""federal post card registration."" the possibilities could not only cheapen our ballot, but in fact threaten the entire electoral process. control of the united states congress by the democrat party for of the past years has resulted in a system dominated by powerful individuals and riddled with corruption. recent events have demonstrated an unwillingness and inability by the democrat party to cleanse itself. selective morality has been the order of the day. positive republican initiatives have languished in democrat-controlled congressional committees while business as usual has continued in washington. the american people demand and deserve reform of the united states congress. we offer these proposals of far-reaching reform: - repeal of legislation which permits automatic increases in the salaries of members of congress, congressional staffs, and official expense allowances. public accountability demands that members publicly vote on increases on the expenses of their office. members' salary increases should not become effective until a new congress is elected. - elimination of proxy voting which allows members to record votes in committee without being present for the actual deliberations or vote on a measure. - elimination of democrat caucus rules which allow a party to bind its members' votes on legislation. each member of congress represents his constituency and must be free to vote in accordance with the dictates of his constituency and individual conscience. - a complete audit by the general accounting office of all congressional allowances and appropriate disciplinary measures for those who have violated the public trust. - full public disclosure of financial interests by members and divestiture of those interests which present conflicts of interest. - changes in the house rules which would allow a house majority to require the house ethics committee to conduct an investigation into alleged misconduct by any member of congress if the committee refuses to act on its own. - a complete overhaul and streamlining of the system which has permitted the proliferation of subcommittees. with overlapping responsibilities, vague jurisdictional definitions and a lack of legislative production . - quarterly publication of names, titles and salaries of all congressional employees. - improved lobby disclosure legislation so that the people will know how much money is being spent to influence public officials . citizens are demanding the end to the rapid and wasteful increase in the size of washington government. all steps must be taken to insure that unnecessary federal agencies and programs are eliminated and that congress carefully scrutinize the total budget of each agency. if it is determined that sunset laws and zero-based budgeting can accomplish these ends then they will have our support. washington programs must be made as cost-effective as those in the states and localities. among the many serious complaints that we wish to register on behalf of the american people is the poor operation of the united states postal service we note the low respect the public has for congress - a democrat-controlled institution - and wonder how the democrats can possibly honor their pledge government when they have utterly failed to reform congress. a safe and just society every american has a right to be protected from criminals. violence has no place in our land. a society that excuses crime will eventually fall victim to it. the american people have been subjected to an m intolerable wave of violent crime. the victim of a crime should be treated with compassion and justice. the attacker must be kept from harming others. emphasis must be on protecting the innocent and punishing the guilty. prevention of it crime is its best deterrent and should be stressed. fighting crime is -and should be - primarily a local responsibility. we support the continuation of the federal help given through the law enforcement assistance administration to law enforcement officials in our states, counties and municipalities. each state should have the power to decide whether it wishes to impose the death penalty for certain crimes. all localities are urged to tighten their bail practices and to review their sentencing and parole procedures. the federal criminal code should include automatic and mandatory minimum sentences for persons committing offenses under federal jurisdiction that involve the use of a dangerous weapon; that involve exceptionally serious crimes, such as trafficking in hard drugs, kidnapping and aircraft hijacking; and that involve injuries committed by repeat offenders. the work presently being done to tighten the anti-obscenity provisions of the criminal code has our full support. since the jurisdiction of the federal government in this field is limited to interstate commerce and the mails, we urge state and local governments to assume a major role in limiting the distribution and availability of obscene materials. we support the right of citizens to keep and bear arms. we oppose federal registration of firearms. mandatory sentences for crimes committed with a lethal weapon are the only effective solution to this problem. sure and swift justice demands additional judges, united states attorneys and other court workers. the democrat congress has created no new federal judgeships since ; we deplore this example of playing politics with the justice system. drug abuse is not simply a health problem, but also a very real law enforcement concern and a problem of worldwide dimension. controlling drug abuse calls for the ratification of the existing international treaty on synthetic drugs, increased emphasis on preventing the diversion of amphetamines and barbiturates into illegal markets, and intensive efforts to keep drugs out of this country. heroin continues top come across our borders. drug enforcement agents and international cooperation must cut off this supply. we say: treat the addicts, but, at the same time, remove the pushers from the street and give them mandatory sentences juveniles now account for almost half the arrests for serious crimes - murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. the cost of school violence and vandalism is estimated at $ million annually, about what is spent on textbooks. primary responsibility for raising our children, instilling proper values and thus preventing juvenile delinquency lies with the family, not the government. yet when families fail, local law enforcement authorities must respond. law enforcement block grant funds can be used by states in correcting and preventing juvenile delinquency. the leaa should promote additional research in this area. the structure of the family must be strengthened. all enterprises have to be encouraged to find more jobs for young people. a youth differential must be included in the minimum wage law. citizen action should let the television industry know that we want it to curb violence in programming because of its effect on our youth. the criminal justice system must be more vigilant in preventing rape, eliminating discrimination against the victim and dealing with the offenders. states should recognize that antiquated and overcrowded prisons are not conducive to rehabilitation. a high priority of prison reform should be to help the young first-time offender. there should be adequate separation of young from adult offenders, more relevant prison industries, better counseling, community-based alternatives and more help in getting a job for the offender who has served his or her time. terrorism - both domestic and international - must be stopped. not only must the strongest steps be taken in the united states, but collective action must come from all nations. deterring every form of hijacking calls for sanctions against countries that aid terrorists. the world community should take appropriate action to deal with terrorist organizations. we applaud the daring rescue by israel of innocent civilian hostages who were kidnapped by terrorists. while we regret that loss of life was involved, the courageous manner in which the hostages were freed speaks eloquently to our abhorrence of world bandits. the right to privacy liberty depends in great measure on the privacy that each american retains. we are alarmed by washington's growing collection of information. the number of federal data banks is now estimated at between and and more than agencies are involved. we question the need for all these computers to be storing records of our lives. safeguards must protect us against this information being misused or disclosed. major changes, for example, are needed to maintain the confidentiality of tax returns and social security records. recent supreme court decisions have held that an individual has no constitutional right to the privacy of records held in banks or other depository institutions and that they can be readily obtained by law enforcement agencies without a person's consent or knowledge. law enforcement authorities must be able to pursue criminal violators, yet, at the same time, there should be reasonable controls imposed to protect the privacy of law-abiding citizens. we support legislation, now pending, to assure this protection. too many government records, on the other hand, are unnecessarily classified. congress and the executive should devise a more reasonable system for classifying and handling government information. the president's achievements in protecting privacy are unequalled by past administrations and must be built upon in the future. we particularly note changes in federal record-keeping systems, the appointment of the commission on the cia, the reorganization of the intelligence community and the restriction of white house access to income tax returns. the american family families must continue to be the foundation of our nation. families - not government programs - are the best way to make sure our children are properly nurtured, our elderly are cared for, our cultural and spiritual heritages are perpetuated, our laws are observed and our values are preserved. if families fail in these vitally important tasks, there is little the government, no matter how well-intentioned, can do to remedy the results. schools cannot educate children adequately if families are not supportive of the learning process. law enforcement authorities are nearly helpless to curb juvenile delinquency without family cooperation in teaching young people respect for property and laws. neither medicine nor school feeding programs can replace the family's ability to provide the basis for good health. isolation from meaningful family contact makes it virtually impossible for the elderly to avoid loneliness or dependence. the values of hard work and responsibility start with the family. as modern life brings changes in our society, it also puts stresses on families trying to adjust to new realities while maintaining cherished values. economic uncertainty, unemployment, housing difficulties, women's and men's concerns with their changing and often conflicting roles, high divorce rates, threatened neighborhoods and schools, and public scandal all create a hostile atmosphere that erodes family structures and family values. thus it is imperative that our government's programs, actions, officials and social welfare institutions never be allowed to jeopardize the family. we fear the government may be powerful enough to destroy our families; we know that it is not powerful enough to replace them. because of our concern for family values, we affirm our beliefs, stated elsewhere in this platform, in many elements that will make our country a more hospitable environment for family life - neighborhood schools; educational systems that include and are responsive to parents' concerns; estate tax changes to establish more realistic exemptions which will minimize disruption of already bereaved families; a position on abortion that values human life, a welfare policy to encourage rather than discourage families to stay together and seek economic independence; a tax system that assists rather than penalizes families with elderly members, children in day care or children in college; economic and employment policies that stop the shrinkage of our dollars and stimulate the creation of jobs so that families can plan for their economic security . education our children deserve quality education . we believe that segregated schools are morally wrong and unconstitutional. however, we oppose forced busing to achieve racial balances in our schools. we believe there are educational advantages for children in attending schools in their own neighborhoods and that the democrat-controlled congress has failed to enact legislation to protect this concept. the racial composition of many schools results from decisions by people about where they choose to live. if congress continues to fail to act, we would favor consideration of an amendment to the constitution forbidding the assignment of children to schools on the basis of race. our approach is to work to eradicate the root causes of segregated schools, such as housing discrimination and gerrymandered school districts. we must get on with the education of all our children. throughout our history, the education of our children has been a community responsibility. but now federal categorical grant programs pressure local school districts into substituting washington-dictated priorities for their own. local school administrators and school boards are being turned into bookkeepers for the federal government. red tape and restrictive regulations stifle imagination and creativity. we are deeply concerned about the decline in the performance of our schools and the decline in public confidence in them. we favor consideration of tax credits for parents making elementary and secondary school tuition payments. local communities wishing to conduct non-sectarian prayers in their public schools should be able to do so. we favor a constitutional amendment to achieve this end. we propose consolidating federal categorical grant programs into block grants and turning the money over to the states to use in accordance with their own needs and priorities and with minimum bureaucratic controls. a single program must preserve the funding that is directed at the needs of such special groups as the handicapped and the disadvantaged. primary responsibility for education, particularly on the elementary and secondary levels, belongs to local communities and parents. intrusion by the federal government must be avoided. bureaucratic control of schools by washington has the potential for destruction of our educational system by taking more and more decisions away from parents and local school authorities. total financial dependence on the federal government inevitably leads to greater centralization of authority. we believe, therefore, that a study should be authorized concerning funding of elementary and secondary education, coupled with a study regarding return to the states of equivalent revenue to compensate for any loss in present levels of federal funding. unless steps are taken immediately, soaring prices will restrict a college education to the rich and those poor enough to qualify now for government aid. federal higher education policy should continue to focus on financial aid for needy individuals, but because the financial ability to go to college is fast slipping out of the grasp of middle income families, more realistic eligibility guidelines for student aid are essential . government interference in the management of colleges and universities must be stopped. federal support to assist in meeting the grave financial problems of higher education should be forthcoming, but such funds should never be used as devices for imposing added controls. diversity in education has great value. public schools and non-public schools should share in education funds on a constitutionally acceptable basis. private colleges and universities should be assisted to maintain healthy competition and to enrich diversity. the cost of expanding public campuses can be kept down if existing private institutions are helped to accommodate our student population. we favor continued special federal support for vocational education. health every american should have access to quality health care at an affordable price. the possibility of an extended illness in a family is a frightening prospect, but, if it does happen, a person should at least be protected from having it wipe out lifetime savings. catastrophic expenses incurred from major illnesses and accidents affect only a small percentage of americans each year, but for those people, the financial burden can be devastating. we support extension of catastrophic illness protection to all who cannot obtain it. we should utilize our private health insurance system to assure adequate protection for those who do not have it. such an approach will eliminate the red tape and high bureaucratic costs inevitable in a comprehensive national program. the republican party opposes compulsory national health insurance. americans should know that the democrat platform, which offers a government-operated and financed ""comprehensive national health insurance system with universal and mandatory coverage,"" will increase federal government spending by more than $-billion in its first full year. such a plan, could require a personal income tax increase of approximately per cent. we oppose this huge, new health insurance tax. moreover, we do not believe that the federal government can administer effectively the democrats' cradle-to-grave proposal. the most effective, efficient and economical method to improve health care and extend its availability to all is to build on the present health delivery and insurance system, which covers nine out of every ten americans. a coordinated effort should be mounted immediately to contain the rapid increase in health care costs by all available means, such as development of healthier life styles through education, improved preventive care, better distribution of medical manpower, emphasis on out-of-hospital services and elimination of wasteful duplication of medical services. we oppose excessive intrusions from washington in the delivery of health care. we believe in preserving the privacy that should exist between a patient and a physician, particularly in regard to the confidentiality of medical records. federal health programs should be consolidated into a single grant to each state, where possible, thereby allowing much greater flexibility in setting local priorities. our rural areas, for example, have different health care delivery needs than our cities. federal laws and regulations should respect these differences and make it possible to respond differently to differing needs. fraud in medicare and medicaid programs should be exposed and eliminated. we need a comprehensive and equitable approach to the subject of mental health. such a program should focus on the prevention, treatment and care of mental illness. it should cover all aspects of the interrelationships between emotional illness and other specific disabilities. the republican party applauds the enlightened programs that address mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and other developmental disabilities that seek to remove us from the dark ages in these areas. alcoholism and drug abuse, growing problems in america today, should receive the utmost attention. while we support valid medical and biological research efforts which can produce life-saving results, we oppose any research on live fetuses. we are also opposed to any legislation which sanctions ending the life of any patient. child nutrition every child should have enough to eat. good nutrition is a prerequisite of a healthy life. we must focus our resources on feeding needy children. the present school lunch programs provide a per cent subsidy underwrite the meals of children from middle- and upper-income families. the existing child nutrition programs should be concentrated on those children truly in need. other federal programs should assure that low-income people will be able to purchase a nutritionally adequate food supply. equal rights and ending discrimination roadblocks must be removed that maybe prevent americans from realizing their full potential in society. unfair discrimination is a burden that intolerably weighs morally, economically and politically upon a free nation. while working to eradicate discriminatory practices, every citizen should be encouraged to take pride in and foster the cultural heritage that has been passed on from previous generations. almost every american traces ancestry from another country; this cultural diversity gives strength to our national heritage. there must be vigorous enforcement of laws to assure equal treatment in job recruitment, hiring, promotion, pay, credit, mortgage access and housing. the way to end discrimination, however, is not by resurrecting the much discredited quota system and attempting to cloak it in an aura of new respectability. rather, we must provide alternative means of assisting the victims of past discrimination to realize their full worth as american citizens. wiping out past discrimination requires continued emphasis on providing educational opportunities for minority citizens, increasing direct and guaranteed loans to minority business enterprises, and affording qualified minority persons equal opportunities for government positions at all levels. women women, who comprise a numerical majority of the population, have been denied a just portion of our nation's rights and opportunities. we reaffirm our pledge to work to eliminate discrimination in all areas for reasons of race, color, national origin, age, creed or sex and to enforce vigorously laws guaranteeing women equal rights. the republican party reaffirms its support for ratification of the equal rights amendment. our party was the first national party to endorse the e.r.a. in . we continue to believe its ratification is essential to insure equal rights for all americans. in our platform, the republican party recognized the great contributions women have made to society as homemakers and mothers, as contributors to the community through volunteer work, and as members of the labor force in careers. the platform stated then, and repeats now, that the republican party ""fully endorses the principle of equal rights, equal opportunities and equal responsibilities for women."" the equal rights amendment is the embodiment of this principle and therefore we support its swift ratification. the question of abortion is one of the most difficult and controversial of our time. it is undoubtedly a moral and personal issue but it also involves complex questions relating to medical science and criminal justice. there are those in our party who favor complete support for the supreme court decision which permits abortion on demand. there are others who share sincere convictions that the supreme court's decision must be changed by a constitutional amendment prohibiting all abortions. others have yet to take a position, or they have assumed a stance somewhere in between polar positions. we protest the supreme court's intrusion into the family structure through its denial of the parents obligation and right to guide their minor children. the republican party favors a continuance of the public dialogue on abortion and supports the efforts of those who seek enactment of a constitutional amendment to restore protection of the right to life for unborn children. the social security system, our federal tax laws, and unemployment and disability programs currently discriminate against women and often work against married couples as well. these inequities must be corrected. we recognize that special support must be given to the increasing number of women who have assumed responsibility as the heads of households while also being wage earners. programs for job training, counseling and other services should be established to help them attain their dual role in society. we reiterate the pledges elsewhere in this platform of support for child care assistance, part-time and flexible-time work that enables men and women to combine employment and family responsibilities, estate tax reform, small business assistance for women, rape prevention and elimination of discriminatory housing practices. ethnic americans ethnic americans have enriched this nation with their hard work, self-reliance and respect for the rights and needs of others ethnic groups reaching our shores at various times have given our country its unique identity and strength among the nations of the world. we recognize and value the contributions of ethnic americans to our free and democratic society. hispanic-americans when language is a cause of discrimination, there must be an intensive educational effort to enable spanish-speaking students to become fully proficient in english while maintaining their own language and cultural heritage. hispanic-americans must not be treated as second-class citizens in schools, employment or any other aspect of life just because english is not their first language. hispanic-americans truly believe that individual integrity must be paramount what they want most from government and politics is the opportunity to participate fully. the republican party has and always will offer this opportunity. indians and alaska natives we have a unique commitment to native americans; we pledge to continue to honor our trust relationship with them, and we reaffirm our federal indian policy of self-determination without termination. this means moving smoothly and quickly away from federal domination to effective participation and communication by indians in the political process and in the planning content and administration of federal programs. we shall pursue our joint effort with indian leaders to assist in the orderly development of indian and native-owned resources and to continue to attack the severe health, education and unemployment problems which exist among indians and alaska natives. puerto rico, the district of columbia and the territories the principle of self-determination also governs our positions on puerto rico and the district of columbia as it has in past platforms. we again support statehood for puerto rico, if that is the people's choice in a referendum, with full recognition within the concept of a multicultural society of the citizens' right to retain their spanish language and traditions; and support giving the district of columbia voting representation in the united states senate and house of representatives and full home rule over those matters that are purely local. we will continue to negotiate with the congress of micronesia on the future political status of the trust territories of the pacific islands to meet the mutual interests of both parties. we support a plebiscite by the people of american samoa on whether they wish to elect a territorial governor. we favor whatever action necessary to permit american citizens resident in guam, puerto rico and the virgin islands to vote for president and vice president in national elections. responsibilities finally, the most basic principle of all: achievement and preservation of human rights in our society is based on the willing acceptance by millions of americans of their responsibilities as free citizens. instead of viewing government programs with ever increasing expectations, we must readily assume the obligations of wage-earners, taxpayers and supporters of our government institution and laws. this is often forgotten, and so it is appropriate to remind ourselves in this platform that this is why our society works. handicapped citizens handicapped persons must be admitted into the mainstream of our society. too often the handicapped population of the nation - over million men, women and children - has been denied the rights taken for granted by other citizens. time after time, the paths are closed to the handicapped in education, employment, transportation, health care, housing, recreation, insurance, polling booths and due process of law. national involvement is necessary to correct discrimination in these areas. individual incentive alone cannot do it. we pledge continued attention to the problems caused by barriers in architecture, communication, transportation and attitudes. in addition, we realize that to deny education and employment simply because of an existing disability runs counter to our accepted belief in the free enterprise system and forces the handicapped to be overly dependent on others. similarly, the denial of equal access to credit and to acquisition of venture capital on the basis of a handicap or other disability conflicts with republican philosophy. we advocate the elimination of needless barriers for all handicapped persons. working americans free collective bargaining remains the best way to insure that american workers receive a fair price for their labors. the special problems of collective bargaining in state and local government should be addressed at those levels. washington should not impose its standards on local governments. while we oppose strikes by public employees, we recognize that states have the right to permit them if they choose. union membership as a condition of employment has been regulated by state law under section (b) of the taft-hartley act. this basic right should continue to be determined by the states. we oppose strikes by federal employees, the unionization of our military forces and the legalization of common-situs picketing. employees of the federal government should not engage in partisan politics. the civil service system must remain nonpartisan and non-political. the hatch act now protects federal employees, we insist that it be uniformly administered. among the rights that are the entitlement of every american worker is the right to join a union - large, small or independent; the right to be protected against racial discrimination and misuse of dues the right to union elections that are fair and democratic; and the right to be assured of ultimately receiving his or her promised pension benefits. safe and healthful working conditions are goals of utmost importance. we should expect the occupational safety and health administration to help employers, particularly in small businesses, comply with the law, and we will support legislation providing on-site consultation. there should be considerable concern over the presence of several million illegal aliens in the country who fill jobs that otherwise would be available to american workers. we support increased efforts to deal more effectively with this problem and favor legislation prohibiting employers from knowingly hiring illegal aliens. the democrat leaders in congress have systematically killed every attempt to debate this legislation in recent years. increased part-time and flexible-hour work should be encouraged wherever feasible. in keeping with our belief in family life, we want to expand more opportunities for men and women to combine family responsibilities and employment. welfare reform the work of all americans contributes to the strength of our nation, and all who are able to contribute should be encouraged to do so. in every society there will be some who cannot work, often through no fault of their own. the measure of a country's compassion is how it treats the least fortunate. we appreciate the magnificent variety of private charitable institutions which have developed in the united states. the democrat-controlled congress has produced a jumble of degrading, dehumanizing, wasteful, overlapping and inefficient programs failing to assist the needy poor. a systematic and complete overhaul of the welfare system should be initiated immediately. the following goals should govern the reform of the welfare system: () provide adequate living standards for the truly needy; () end welfare fraud and prevent it in the future with emphasis on removing ineligible recipients from the welfare rolls, tightening food stamp eligibility requirements, and ending aid to illegal aliens and the voluntarily unemployed; () strengthen work requirements, particularly directed at the productive involvement of able-bodied persons in useful community work projects; () provide educational and vocational incentives to allow recipients to become self-supporting; () better coordinate federal efforts with local and state social welfare agencies and strengthen local and state administrative functions. we oppose federalizing the welfare system; local levels of government are most aware of the needs of their communities. consideration should be given to a range of options in financing the programs to assure that state and local responsibilities are met. we also oppose the guaranteed annual income concept or any programs that reduce the incentive to work. those features of the present law, particularly the food stamp program, that draw into assistance programs people who are capable of paying for their own needs should be corrected. the humanitarian purpose of such programs must not be corrupted by eligibility loopholes. food stamp program reforms proposed by republicans in congress would accomplish the twin goals of directing resources to those most in need and streamlining administration. we must never forget that unemployment compensation is insurance, not a welfare program. it should be redesigned to assure that working is always more beneficial than collecting unemployment benefits. the benefits should help most the hard-core unemployed. major efforts must be encouraged through the private sector to speed up the process of finding jobs for those temporarily out of work. older americans older americans constitute one of our most valuable resources. families should be supported in trying to take care of their elderly. too often government laws and policies contribute to the deterioration of family life. our tax laws, for example, permit a deduction to the taxpayer who gives a contribution to a charitable institution that might care for an elderly parent, but offer little or no incentive to provide care in the home. if an elderly parent relinquishes certain assets and enters a nursing home, the parent may qualify for full medicaid coverage, but if parents live with their children, any supplemental security income benefit for which they are eligible may be reduced. incentives must be written into law to encourage families to care for their older members . along with loneliness and ill health, older americans are deeply threatened by inflation. the costs of the basic necessities of life-food, shelter, clothing, health care-have risen so drastically as to reduce the ability of many older persons to subsist with any measure of dignity. in addition to our program for protecting against excessive costs of long-term illness, nothing will be as beneficial to the elderly as the effect of this platform's proposals on curbing inflation. the social security benefits are of inestimable importance to the well-being and financial peace-of-mind of most older americans. we will not let the social security system fail. we will work to make the social security system actuarily sound. the social security program must not be turned into a welfare system, based on need rather than contributions. the cost to employers for social security contributions must not be raised to the point where they will be unable to afford contributions to employees' private pension programs. we will work for an increase in the earned income ceiling or its elimination so that, as people live longer, there will not be the present penalty on work. we will also seek to correct those provisions of the system that now discriminate against women and married couples. such programs as foster grandparents and senior companions, which provide income exempt from social security limitations, should be continued and extended to encourage senior citizens to continue to be active and involved in society. appropriate domiciliary care programs should be developed to enable senior citizens to receive such care without losing other benefits to which they may be entitled. we favor the abolition of arbitrary levels for mandatory retirement. the medicare program must be improved to help control inflation in health care costs triggered by present regulation. other areas of concern to the elderly that need increased attention are home and outpatient care, adequate transportation, nutrition, day care and homemaker care as an alternative to costly institutional treatment. a nation should be judged by its ability to help make all the years of life as productive and gainful as possible. this nation still has a job to do. veterans the nation must never forget its appreciation and obligation to those who have served in the armed forces. because they bear the heaviest burdens of war, we owe special honor and compensation to disabled veterans and survivors of the war dead. we are firmly committed to maintaining and improving our veterans administration hospital system. younger veterans, especially those who served in the vietnam conflict, deserve educational, job and housing loan benefits equivalent to those of world war ii and the korean conflict. because of our deep and continuing concern for those still listed as prisoners of war or missing in action in vietnam, the foreign policy section of this. republican platform calls for top priority actions. and we must continue to provide for our veterans at their death a final resting place for their remains in a national cemetery and the costs of transportation thereto. a national urban strategy the decay and decline of communities in this country is not just a physical and economic crisis, but traceable to the decline of a real ""sense of community"" in our society. community development cannot be achieved merely by throwing dollars and mortar at our community problems; what must be developed is a new sense of mutual concern and responsibility among all members of a community for its improvement. we recognize the family, the neighborhood and the private volunteer sector to be the most basic and vital units within our communities and their central role in revitalizing our communities. we propose a strategy for urban revitalization that both treats our urban areas as social organisms and recognizes that the family is the basic building block in these organisms. effectively helping our cities now requires a coordinated national urban policy. the cornerstone of this policy must be to curb inflation. this policy must be based on the principle that the levels of government closest to the cities' problems are best able to respond. thus federal and state assistance to cities and counties should give the greatest flexibility to those directly on the scene, the local elected officials. such a policy should replace grant programs - the approach of the democrat congress - with block grant programs that allow cities and counties to set their own priorities. without an urban policy, the democrat-controlled congress has created a hodge podge of programs which have all but destroyed our once vital cities. at the same time. urban crime rates have skyrocketed and the quality and promise of metropolitan education systems have plummeted. all this has happened during the years that the number of federal urban programs has increased almost tenfold: from in to in ; and expenditures have increased per cent: from $-billion to $-billion. the republican programs of revenue sharing and block grants for community development and manpower have already immensely helped our cities and counties. we favor extension of revenue sharing and the orderly conversion of categorical grants into block grants. when federal assistance programs for general purpose local governments are administered through the states, there should be direct pass-through and an effective role for cities and counties in the planning, allocation and use of the funds . federal, state and local government resources combined are not enough to solve our urban problems. the private sector must he the major participant. economic development is the best way to involve business and industry; government support should emphasize capital formation and technical assistance for small and minority businesses . we can bring about a new ""birth of freedom"" by following the example of those individuals organizations and community leaders who have successfully solved specific undesirable conditions and problems through private efforts. government officials should be aware of these successes in developing new approaches to public problems. financial institutions should be encouraged to participate in the financial requirements of urban development. each institution should recognize its responsibility in promoting and maintaining economic growth and stability in the central cities. our urban policies should encourage families and businesses to improve their neighborhoods by means of participation in neighborhood self-help groups, improving and rehabilitating their homes and businesses, and investing in and managing local businesses. we support the revision of federal business assistance programs to encourage joint efforts by local merchants' associations. we need a comprehensive approach to plan, develop and implement a variety of programs which take into account the many diverse needs of each neighborhood. the establishment of a national neighborhood policy will signal a commitment to the improvement of the quality of our life in our neighborhoods. we call for an expansion of the president's committee on urban development and neighborhood revitalization to include representatives of elected state and local officials and the private sector. taken together, the thrust of the proposals in this section and in such related areas as housing, transportation, safety and taxes should contribute significantly to again making our cities a pleasant place to live. the republican national urban strategy has been formed in the realization that when the bell tolls for the cities it tolls for all of america. housing in the united states today we are the best housed nation in the history of world civilization. this accomplishment was achieved by a private enterprise system using free market concepts. all of our citizens should be given the opportunity to live in decent, affordable housing. we believe that we should continue to pursue the primary goal of expanding housing opportunities for all americans and we should pursue the companion goal of reducing the degree of direct federal involvement in housing. to most americans the american dream is a home of their own. the time has come to face some hard realities, primarily that the greatest impediment to decent and affordable housing is inflation. it logically follows that one effective housing program would be simply to elect a republican congress which would balance the federal budget. to meet the housing needs of this country there must be a continuous, stable and adequate flow of funds for the purpose of real estate mortgages at realistic interest rates. to continue to encourage home ownership which now encompasses per cent of our families, we support the deductibility of interest on home mortgages and property taxes. we favor the concept of federal revenue sharing and block grants to reduce the excessive burden of the property tax in financing local government. we are concerned with the excessive reliance of financing welfare and public school costs primarily by the property tax. we support inflation-impact studies on governmental regulations, which are inflating housing costs. current economic problems and environmental concerns must be balanced in each community by a policy of ""sensible growth ."" we oppose discrimination in housing, whether by individuals or by institutional financing policies. we urge continued incentives to support the development of low and moderate income housing in order to assure the availability of adequate shelter for the less fortunate. rehabilitation and preservation of existing housing stock should be given high priority in federal housing policy. we urge the continuation of the self-help restoration of housing, such as urban homesteading, which is providing housing for low-income families. transportation the federal government has a special responsibility to foster those elements of our national transportation system that are essential to foreign and interstate commerce and national defense. in other transportation systems that primarily support local needs, the federal government's responsibility is to encourage the greatest possible decision-making and flexibility on the part of state and local governments to spend funds in ways that make the best sense for each community. thus all levels of government have an important role in providing a balanced and coordinated transportation network. in keeping with national transportation goals, the railroad revitalization and regulatory reform act of has begun the task of removing regulatory constraints of the interstate commerce commission on america's ailing railroads. now we should carefully assess the need to remove many of the regulatory constraints imposed on the nation's airlines and motor carriers. consumers pay too high a price for the artificial fare and rate structures imposed by federal regulations. the great interstate highway system, initiated by president eisenhower, has brought new freedom of travel to every american and must be completed and maintained. our road network should always stress safety through better design as well as bridge maintenance and replacement. we must also have a safe and efficient aviation system capable of responding to the air transportation needs of the future and of reducing exposure to aircraft noise. this includes airport development, navigational and safety facilities, and the design and adequate staffing of advanced air traffic control systems. in airplane use as in other modes of transportation, the impact on the physical environment must always be a basic consideration in federal decisions and such decisions should also include appraisals of impact on the economy. we deplore unfair treatment of united states airlines under foreign landing regulations. research must be continued to find safe, more fuel-efficient automobile motors and airplanes; safer, faster rail service; and more convenient, less expensive urban transportation. tax policies should be considered which would stimulate the development and installation of new energy sources in transportation, such as railroad electrification. the disorganization of a democrat-controlled congress frustrates the coordination of transportation policy. currently there are more than congressional subcommittees with independent jurisdiction in the transportation field. this hopelessly disjointed and disorganized approach must be reformed. in keeping with the local goal setting in transportation, the republican party applauds the system under which state and local governments can divert funds from interstate highway mileage not essential to interstate commerce or national defense to other, more pressing community needs, such as urban mass transit. we support the concept of a surface transportation block grant which would include the various highway and mass transit programs now in existence. this will provide local elected officials maximum flexibility in selecting and implementing the balanced transportation systems best suited to each locality. it will encompass both capital and operating subsidies for urban mass transit. it will eliminate red tape and over-regulation. we regret that the democrat-controlled congress has not adopted such a reform. energy in , americans were shocked to discover that a plentiful supply of energy could no longer be assumed. unfortunately, the democrat majority in congress still has not responded to this clear and urgent warning. the united states is now consuming more imported oil than it was three years ago and our dependence on foreign sources has continued to increase to the point where we now import more than % of our oil. one fact should now be clear: we must reduce sharply our dependence on other nations for energy and strive to achieve energy independence at the earliest possible date. we cannot allow the economic destiny and international policy of the united states to be dictated by the sovereign powers that control major portions of the world's petroleum supplies. our approach toward energy self-sufficiency must involve both expansion of energy supply and improvement of energy efficiency. it must include elements that insure increased conservation at all levels of our society. it must also provide incentives for the exploration and development of domestic gas, oil, coal and uranium, and for expanded research and development in the use of solar, geothermal, co-generation, solid waste, wind, water, and other sources of energy. we must use our non-renewable resources wisely while we develop alternative supplies for the future. our standard of living is directly tied to a continued supply of energy resources. without an adequate supply of energy, our entire economy will crumble. unwise government intervention in the marketplace has caused shortage of supply, unrealistic prices and increased dependence on foreign sources. we must immediately eliminate price controls on oil and newly-discovered natural gas in order to increase supply, and to provide the capital that is needed to finance further exploration and development of domestic hydrocarbon reserves. fair and realistic market prices will encourage sensible conservation efforts and establish priorities in the use of our resources, which over the long run will provide a secure supply at reasonable prices for all. the nation's clear and present need is for vast amounts of new capital to finance exploration, discovery, refining, and delivery of currently usable forms of energy, including the use of coal as well as discovery and development of new sources. at this critical time, the democrats have characteristically resorted to political demagoguery seeking short-term political gain at the expense of the long-term national interest. they object to the petroleum industry making any profit. the petroleum industry is an important segment of our economy and is entitled to reasonable profits to permit further exploration and development. at the height of the energy crisis, the republican administration proposed a strong, balanced energy package directed at both expansion of supply and conservation of energy. the response from the democrats in congress was to inhibit expanded production through artificially set price and allocation controls, thereby preventing market forces from working to make energy expansion economically feasible. now, the democrats proposed to dismember the american oil industry. we vigorously oppose such divestiture of oil companies - a move which would surely result in higher energy costs, inefficiency and under-capitalization of the industry. democrats have also proposed that the federal government compete with industry in energy development by creating a national oil company. we totally oppose this expensive, inefficient and wasteful intrusion into an area which is best handled by private enterprise. the democrats are playing politics with energy. if they are permitted to continue, we will pay a heavy price in lost energy and lost jobs during the decades ahead. immediate removal of counterproductive bureaucratic redtape will eliminate hindrances to the exploration and development of hydrocarbons and other energy resources. we will accelerate development of oil shale reserves, alaskan petroleum and the leasing of the outer continental shelf, always within the context of preserving the fullest possible protection for the environment. we will reduce complexity and delays involved in siting, licensing and the regulatory procedures affecting power generation facilities and refineries. coal, america's most abundant energy resource, is of inestimable value to the american people. it can provide the energy needed to bridge the gap between oil and gas and nuclear and other sources of energy. the uncertainties of governmental regulation regarding the mining, transportation and use of coal must be removed and a policy established which will assure that governmental restraints, other than proper environmental controls, do not prevent the use of coal. mined lands must be returned to beneficial use. uranium offers the best intermediate solution to america's energy crisis. we support accelerated use of nuclear energy through processes that have been proven safe. government research on the use of nuclear energy will be expanded to include perfecting a long-term solution to the problems of nuclear waste. among alternative future energy sources, fusion, with its unique potential for supplying unlimited clean energy and the promise of new methods of natural resource recovery, warrants continued emphasis in our national energy research program and we support measures to assure adequate capital investment in the development of new energy sources. environment and natural resources a clean and healthy natural environment is the rightful heritage of every american. in order to preserve this heritage, we will provide for proper development of resources, safeguards for clean air and water, and protection and enhancement of our recreation and scenic areas. as our environmental sophistication grows, we must more clearly define the role of the federal government in environmental protection. we believe that it is a national responsibility to support scientific and technological research and development to identify environmental problems and arrives at solutions. we are in complete accord with the recent supreme court decision on air pollution that allows the level of government closest to the problem and the solution to establish and apply appropriate air quality standards . we are proud of the progress that the current republican administration has made toward bringing pollution of water, land and air under control. we will meet the challenges that remain by stepping up efforts to perfect our understanding of pollutants and the means for reducing their effects. moreover, as the nation develops new energy sources and technologies, we must insure that they meet safe environmental standards. we renew our commitments to the development of additional water supplies by desalinization, and to the more efficient use and refuse of waters currently available. we are determined to preserve land use planning as a unique responsibility of state and local government. we take particular pride in the expanded use of the national park system in recent years, and will provide for continued improvement of the national parks and historic sites. we support establishment of a presidential panel, including representatives of environmental groups, industry, the scientific community and the public to assist in the development of national priorities on environmental and energy issues. this panel will hear and consider alternative policy recommendations set forth by all of the interested groups, and then develop solutions that represent the overall public interest on environmental and energy matters. one of this nation's greatest assets has been our abundant natural resources which have made possible our strong economic and strategic role in the world. we still have a wealth of resources, but they are not of infinite quantity. we must recognize that our material blessings stem from what we grow in the soil take from the sea, or extract from the ground. we have a responsibility to future generations to conserve our nonrenewable natural resources. consistent with our needs, conservation should remain our national policy. the vast land holdings of the federal government - approximately one-third of our nation's area - are the lands from which much of our future production of minerals must come. public lands must be maintained for multiple use management where such uses are compatible. public land areas should not he closed to exploration for minerals or for mining without an overriding national interest. we believe americans want their resources developed properly, their environment kept clean and their recreational and scenic areas kept intact. we support appropriate measures to achieve these goals . we also believe that americans are realistic and recognize that the emphasis on environmental concerns must be brought into balance with the needs for industrial and economic growth so that we can continue to provide jobs for an ever-growing work force. the united states possesses the most productive softwood forests in the world, as well as extensive hardwood forests. demands for housing, fuel, paper, chemicals and a multitude of other such needs require that these renewable resources be wisely managed on both public and private forest lands - not only to meet these needs, but also to provide for soil conservation, wildlife habitats and recreation. recognizing that timber is a uniquely renewable resource, we will use all scientifically sound means to maximize sustained yield, including clear-cutting and replanting where appropriate. we urge the congress to strengthen the national forest service so that it can realize its potential in becoming an effective participant in the reforestation program. we will support broader use of resource recovery and recycling processes through removal of economic disincentives caused by unnecessary government regulation. one of the important issues at stake in the united nations law of the sea conference is access to the mineral resources in and beneath the sea. technology, developed by united states industry, is at hand which can unlock resources of petroleum, manganese, nickel, cobalt, copper and other minerals. we will safeguard the national interest in development and use of these resources. science and technology every aspect of our domestic economy and well-being, our international competitive position, and national security is related to our past and present leadership in basic and applied research and the development of our technology. but there can be no complacency about our continued commitment to maintain this leadership position. in the past, most of these accomplishments have been achieved through a unique partnership between government and industry. this must continue and be expanded in the future. because our society is so dependent upon the advancement of science and the development of technology, it is one of the areas where there must be a central federal policy. we support a national science policy that will foster the public-private partnership to insure that we maintain our leadership role. the national space program plays a pioneer role in exploring the mysteries of our universe and we support its expansion. we recognize that only when our technology is fully distributed can it be assimilated and used to increase our productivity and our standard of living. we will continue to encourage young americans to study science and engineering. finally, we support new initiatives to utilize better the recoverable commodities from solid waste materials. we can no longer afford the luxury of a throw-away world. recycling offers environmental benefits, economic expansion, resource conservation and energy savings. we support a policy which will reward it and economic incentives which will encourage its expansion. arts and humanities the arts and humanities offer an opportunity for every american to become a participant in activities that add fullness, expression, challenge and joy to our daily lives. we republicans consider the preservation of the rich cultural heritages of our various ethnic groups as a priority goal. during our bicentennial year we have celebrated our anniversary with cultural activities as varied and colorful as our cultural heritage. the republican party is proud of its record of support to the arts and humanities during the last eight years. we are committed to steadily increase our support through the national endowments for the nation's museums, theaters, orchestras, dance, opera and film centers as well as for individual artists and writers. this upward trend in funding for the national arts and humanities endowments deserves to continue. but washington's presence should never dominate; it must remain limited to supporting and stimulating the artistic and cultural lives of each community. we favor continued federal assistance to public broadcasting which provides us with creative educational and cultural alternatives. we recognize that public broadcasting is supported mainly through private sector contributions and commend this policy as the best insurance against political interference. in we have seen vivid evidence that america's history lives throughout the nation. we support the continued commemoration throughout the bicentennial era by all americans of those significant events between and which contributed to the creation of this nation. we support the efforts of both the public and private sectors, working in partnership, for the historic preservation of the unique and irreplaceable historic sites and buildings. we propose safeguarding the rights of performing artists in the copyright laws, providing tax relief to artists who contribute their own talents and art works for public enjoyment, and encouraging the use of one per cent of the cost of government buildings for art works. much of the support of the arts and humanities comes from private philanthropy. this generosity should be encouraged by government policies that facilitate charitable donations. fiscal responsibility as republicans, we are proud that in this platform we have urged tax reductions rather than increased government spending. with firm restraint on federal spending this platform pledges that its proposals for tax changes - reductions, structural adjustments, differentials, simplifications and job-producing incentives - can all be achieved within the balanced federal budgets we also demand as vital to the interests of all americans. without such spending restraint, we cannot responsibly cut back taxes. we reaffirm our determination that any net reduction of revenues must be offset by reduced government spending. foreign policy, national defense and international economic policy prologue the foreign policy of the united states defines the relationships we seek with the world as a whole, with friends and with adversaries. our policy must be firmly rooted in principle and must clearly express our goals. our principles cannot be subject to passing whim; they must be true, strong, consistent and enduring. we pledge a realistic and principled foreign policy designed to meet the needs of the nation in the years ahead. the policies we pursue will require an informed consensus; the basis of that consensus will be the american people, whose most cherished desire is to live in freedom and peace, secure from war or threat of war. the united states is a world power with world-wide interests and responsibilities. we pledge the continuation of efforts to revitalize our traditional alliances and to maintain close consultation with our friends. international cooperation and collaboration is required because we can achieve neither our most important objectives nor even our own security in the type of ""splendid isolation"" which is urged upon us by so many strident voices. the regrettable emergence of neo-isolationism often expressed in congress and elsewhere is detrimental, we believe, to a sound foreign policy . the branches of government can and should work together as the necessary prerequisite for a sound foreign policy. we lament the reckless intrusion of one branch into the clear constitutional prerogative of another. confronted by so many challenges and so many crises, the united states must again speak with one voice, united in spirit and in fact. we reject partisan and ideological quarrels across party lines and urge democrats to join with us to lay the foundations of a true bipartisan spirit. let us speak for this country with one voice, so that our policies will not be misunderstood by our allies or our potential adversaries. effective policy must rest on promises which are understood and shared, and must be defined in terms of priorities. as the world has changed in a dynamic fashion, so too have our priorities and goals, and so too have the methods of debating and discussing our objectives. when we assumed executive office eight years ago, we found the national security and foreign policy machinery in shambles. last-minute reactions to crises were the practice. the national security council, so effective under president eisenhower, had fallen into disuse. as an important first step, the national security council machinery was streamlined to cope with the problems of the moment and long-range planning. this restored process allows once again for exhaustive consideration of all the options from which a president must choose. far from stifling internal debate and dissent as had been the practice in the past, republican leadership now invites and stimulates evaluation of complex issues in an orderly decision-making process. republican leadership has also taken steps to report comprehensively its foreign policy and national security objectives. an annual ""state of the world"" message, designed to increase communication with the people and with congress, has become a permanent part of presidential practice. a strong and effective program of global public diplomacy is a vital component of u.s. foreign policy. in an era of instant communications. the world is infinitely and forever smaller, and we must have the capacity to communicate to the world-to inform, to explain and to guard against accidental or willful distortion of united states policies. interdependence has become a fact of international life, linking our actions and policies with those of the world at large. the united states should reach out to other nations to enrich that interdependence. republican leadership has demonstrated that recognition of the ties that bind us to our friends will serve our mutual interests in a creative fashion and will enhance the chances for world peace. morality in foreign policy the goal of republican foreign policy is the achievement of liberty under law and a just and lasting peace in the world. the principles by which we act to achieve peace and to protect the interests of the united states must merit the restored confidence of our people. we recognize and commend that great beacon of human courage and morality, alexander solzhenitsyn, for his compelling message that we must face the world with no illusions about the nature of tyranny. ours will be a foreign policy that keeps this ever in mind. ours will be a foreign policy which recognizes that in international negotiations we must make no undue concessions; that in pursuing detente we must not grant unilateral favors with only the hope of getting future favors in return. agreements that are negotiated, such as the one signed in helsinki, must not take from those who do not have freedom the hope of one day gaining it. finally, we are firmly committed to a foreign policy in which secret agreements, hidden from our people, will have no part. honestly, openly, and with firm conviction, we shall go forward as a united people to forge a lasting peace in the world based upon our deep belief in the rights of man, the rule of law and guidance by the hand of god. national defense a superior national defense is the fundamental condition for a secure america and for peace and freedom for the world. military strength is the path to peace. a sound foreign policy must be rooted in a superior defense capability, and both must be perceived as a deterrent to aggression and supportive of our national interests. the american people expect that their leaders will assure a national defense posture second to none. they know that planning for our national security must be a joint effort by the president and congress. it cannot be the subject of partisan disputes. it should not be held hostage to domestic political adventurism. a minimum guarantee to preserve freedom and insure against blackmail and threats, and in the face of growing soviet military power, requires a period of sustained growth in our defense efforts. in constant dollars, the present defense budge will no more than match the defense budge of , the year before a democrat administration involved america so deeply in the vietnam war. in soviet defense programs exceeded ours in investment by per cent, exceeded ours in operating costs by per cent, and exceeded ours in research and development by per cent. the issue is whether our forces will be adequate to future challenges. we say they must be. we must always achieve maximum value for each defense dollar spent. along with the elimination of the draft and the creation, under a republican president, of all-volunteer armed services, we have reduced the personnel requirements for support functions without affecting our basic posture. today there are fewer americans in the uniformed services than at any time since the fall of . substantial economies have been made in weapons procurement and we will continue to act in a prudent manner with our defense appropriations. our national defense effort will include the continuation of the major modernization program for our strategic missile and bomber forces, the development of a new and intercontinental ballistic missile, a new missile launching submarine force and a modern bomber - the b- - capable of penetrating the most sophisticated air defenses of the 's. these elements will comprise a deterrent of the first order. we will increase our army to divisions, reinforce our program of producing new tanks and other armored vehicles, and support the development of new, highly accurate precision weapons. our navy, the guarantor of freedom of the seas, must have a major shipbuilding program, with an adequate balance between nuclear and non-nuclear ships. the composition of the fleet must be based on a realistic assessment of the threat we face, and must assure that no adversary will gain naval superiority. an important modernization program t for our tactical air forces is under way. we will require new fighters and interceptor aircraft for the air force, navy and marines. as a necessary component of our long-range strategy, we will produce and deploy the b- bomber in a timely manner, allowing us to retain air superiority. our investments in military research: and development are of great importance to our future defense capabilities. we must not lose the vital momentum. with increasing complexity of weapons, lead times for weapons systems are often as long as a decade, requiring careful planning and prudent financial decisions. an outstanding example of this process is the development and deployment of the cruise missile, which incorporates pinpoint precision by means of sophisticated guidance systems and is an exceptionally economical weapon to produce. security assistance programs are important to our allies and we will continue to strengthen their efforts at self-defense the improvement of their capabilities can help to ensure that the world balance is not tipped against us and can also serve to lessen chances for direct u.s. involvement in remote conflicts. as a vital component of our over-all national security posture, the united states must have the best intelligence system in the world the effectiveness of the intelligence community must be restored, consonant with the reforms instituted by president ford. we favor the creation of an independent oversight function by congress and we will withstand partisan efforts to turn any part of our intelligence system into a political football. we will take every precaution to prevent the breakdown of security controls on sensitive intelligence information. endangering the lives of u.s. officials abroad or affecting the ability of the president to act expeditiously whenever legitimate foreign policy and defense needs require it. nato and europe fundamental to a stable, secure world is the continuation of our traditional alliances. the north atlantic treaty organization now approaching the end of its third decade, remains healthy and vigorous . the threat to our mutual security by a totalitarian power bent on expansion brought nations together. the expression of our collective will to resist resulted in the creation and maintenance of a military deterrent which. while not without occasional strains, has served our vital interests well. today that threat continues. we have succeeded in extending our cooperation within nato and have taken bold new steps in economic cooperation with our partners. faced with a serious crisis in the energy field following the imposition of the oil boycott, we demonstrated that it was possible to coordinate our joint activities with the other nato nations. the economic strength of western europe has increased to the point where our nato partners can now assume a larger share of the common defense; in response to our urging, our allies are demonstrating a greater willingness to do so. this is not the time to recommend a unilateral reduction of american military forces in europe. we will, however, pursue the balanced reduction of forces in both western and eastern europe, based on agreements which do not jeopardize the security of the alliance. with our alliance partners. we affirm that a strong nato defense. based on the united states military presence, is vital to the defense of western europe. some of our nato allies have experienced rapid and dynamic changes. we are encouraged by developments in the iberian peninsula, where both portugal and spain now face more promising futures. early consideration should be given to spain's accession to the north atlantic treaty organization. at the same time we would view with concern any political developments elsewhere in europe which are destabilizing to nato interests. we support the right of all nations to choose their leaders. democracy and freedom are best served by ensuring that those fundamental rights are preserved and extended for future generations to choose in freedom. the difficult problem of cyprus, which separates our friends in greece and turkey should be addressed and resolved by those two countries. the eastern flank of nato requires restored cooperation there and eventually, friendly relations between the two countries. republican leadership has strengthened this nation's good relations with the european economic community in an age of increasing competition and potential irritations. we will maintain and strengthen the excellent relations we have achieved with the eec. in the final analysis, the nato alliance will be as effective as our will and determination, as well as that of our allies, to support it. the function of collective security is to deter wars and, if necessary, to fight and win those wars not successfully deterred. our vigilance is especially required during periods of prolonged relaxation of tensions with our adversaries because we cannot permit ourselves to accept words and promises as a substitute for deeds. we are determined that the nato alliance shall not be lulled into a false sense of security. it can and must respond vigorously when called upon to act. asia and the pacific the united states has vital interests in the entire pacific basin and those interests lie foremost in asian tranquility and stability. the experience of ending direct american involvement in a difficult and costly war initiated during democrat administrations has taught us a great deal about how we ought to define our interests in this part of the world. the united states is indisputably a pacific power. we have sought to express our interests in the area through strengthening existing friendly ties and creating new ones. japan will remain the main pillar of our asian policy. we have helped to provide the framework, over the course of thirty years, for the development of the japanese economy, which has risen to second place among free world nations. this nation without natural resources, has maximized its greatest resource, the japanese people to achieve one of the world's most significant economic advances. we will continue our policy of close consultation and cooperation with this valued friend. we have succeeded in establishing an exceptional relationship with japan. our long-range goals of stability and economic cooperation are identical, forming the essential strength of a relationship which both countries seek actively to deepen. with respect to the republic of korea a nation with which we have had traditionally close ties and whose economy has grown rapidly in recent years, we shall continue our policy of military and economic assistance. united states troops will be maintained in korea so long as there exists the possibility of renewed aggression from north korea. time has not dimmed our memories of the sudden assault against south korea. we reaffirm the commitment of the united states to the territorial integrity and the sovereignty of the republic of korea. simultaneously we encourage the governments of south korea and north korea to institute domestic policy initiatives leading to the extension of basic human rights. when republicans assumed executive office in , we were confronted with a war in vietnam involving more than , u.s. troops, and to which we had committed billions of dollars and our national honor and prestige. it was in the spirit of bipartisan support for presidential foreign policy initiatives, inaugurated in the postwar era by senator arthur vandenberg, that most republicans support the united states commitment to assist south vietnam resist communist-sponsored aggression. the human cost to us was great; more than , americans died in that conflict, and more than , were wounded. a policy of patient, persistent and principled negotiations extricated the united states from that ill-fated war with the expectation that peace would prevail. the refusal of the democrat-controlled congress to give support to presidential requests for military aid to the beleaguered nations of south vietnam, cambodia and laos, coupled with sustained military assaults by the communists in gross violation of the paris peace accords, brought about the collapse of those nations and the subjugation of their people to totalitarian rule. we recognize that there is a wide divergence of opinion concerning vietnam, but we pledge that american troops will never again be committed for the purpose of our own defense, or the defense of those to whom we are committed by treaty or other solemn agreements, without the clear purpose of achieving our stated diplomatic and military objectives. we must achieve the return of all americans who may be held in southeast asia, and a full accounting for those listed as missing in action. we strongly urge continued consultation between the president and the national league of families of american prisoners and missing in southeast asia. this country owes at least this much to all of these courageous people who have anguished so long over this matter. to this end, and to underscore our top priority commitment to the families of these pows and mias, we recommend, among other actions, the establishment of a presidential task force headed by a special presidential representative. we condemn the inhumane and criminal retributions which have taken place in cambodia, where mass executions and forced resettlements have been imposed on innocent civilians. the important economic developments taking place in singapore, indonesia, malaysia, the philippines and other asian countries will lead to much improved living standards for the people there. we reaffirm our friendship with these nations. equally, our relationships with australia and new zealand are historic and important to us; they have never been better and provide a firm base on which to build. united states-chinese relations a development of significance for the future of asia and for the world came to fruition in as our communications were restored with the people's republic of china. this event has allowed us to initiate dialogue with the leaders of a quarter of the earth's population, and trade channels with the people's republic have been opened, leading to benefits for each side. the people's republic of china can and will play an increasingly important role in world affairs. we shall seek to engage the people's republic of china in an expanded network of contacts and trade. such a process cannot realistically proceed at a forced or incautious pace; the measured but steady growth of our relations best serves our interests. we do not ignore the profound differences in our respective philosophies, governmental institutions, policies and views on individual liberty, and we are hopeful that basic human rights will be extended to the chinese people. what is truly fundamental is that we have established regular working channels with the people's republic of china and that this process can form an important contribution to world peace. our friendly relations with one great power should not be construed as a challenge to any other nation, large or small. the united states government, while engaged in a normalization of relations with the people's republic of china, will continue to support the freedom and independence of our friend and ally, the republic of china, and its million people. the united states will fulfill and keep its commitments, such as the mutual defense treaty, with the republic of china. the americas the relations of the united states with the americas are of vital and immediate importance. how we conduct our affairs with our neighbors to the north and south will continue to be a priority. in the recent past our attention has at times been diverted to more distant parts of the world. there can be no sensible alternative to close relationships and understanding among the nations of this hemisphere. it is time for a series of new departures in our relations with canada. canada is our most important trading partner, and we are hers. we, as americans, feel a deep affinity for our canadian friends, and we have much at stake in the development of closer relationships based on mutual understanding and complete equality. to our neighbors in mexico, central america and south america, we also say that we wish the opportunity to expand our dialogue. the needs of our friends are great, but this must not serve as an obstacle for a concerted effort to work together more closely. the united states has taken steps to adjust tariffs so as to maximize access to our markets. we recognize that our neighbors place no value on complex and cumbersome aid schemes; they see self-help, modernization, and expanded trade as the main sources of economic progress. we will work with them to define specific steps that we can take to help them achieve greater economic strength, and to advance our mutual interests. by continuing its policies of exporting subversion and violence, cuba remains outside the inter-american family of nations. we condemn attempts by the cuban dictatorship to intervene in the affairs of other nations; and, as long as such conduct continues, it shall remain ineligible for admission to the organization of american states. we shall continue to share the aspirations of the cuban people to regain their liberty we insist that decent and humane conditions be maintained in the treatment of political prisoners in the cuban jails, and we will seek arrangements to allow international entities, such as the international red cross, to investigate and monitor the conditions in those jails. the present panama canal treaty provides that the united states has jurisdictional rights in the canal zone as ""if it were the sovereign."" the united states intends that the panama canal be preserved as an international waterway for the ships of all nations. this secure access is enhanced by a relationship which commands the respect of americans and panamanians and benefits the people of both countries. in any talks with panama, however, the united states negotiators should in no way cede, dilute, forfeit, negotiate or transfer any rights, power, authority, jurisdiction, territory or property that are necessary for the protection and security of the united states and the entire western hemisphere. we reaffirm our faith in the ability of the organization of american states, which remains a valuable means of inter-american consultation. the middle east the preservation of peace and stability in the middle east is a paramount concern. the efforts of two republican administrations, summoning diplomatic and political skills, have been directed toward reduction of tensions and toward avoiding flashpoints which could serve as an excuse for yet another round of conflict between israel and the arab countries. our commitment to israel is fundamental and enduring. we have honored and will continue to honor that commitment in every way - politically, economically and by providing the military aid that israel requires to remain strong enough to deter any potential aggression. forty per cent of all united states' aid that israel has received since its creation in has come in the last two fiscal years, as a result of republican initiatives. our policy must remain one of decisive support for the security and integrity of israel. an equally important component of our commitment to israel lies in continuing our efforts to secure a just and durable peace for all nations in that complex region. our efforts have succeeded, for the first time since the creation of the state of israel in moving toward a negotiated peace settlement which would serve the interests and the security of all nations in the middle east. peace in the middle east now requires face-to-face, direct negotiations between the states involved with the recognition of safe, secure and defensible borders for israel. at the same time, republican administrations have succeeded in reestablishing communication with the arab countries, and have made extensive progress in our diplomatic and commercial relations with the more moderate arab nations . as a consequence of the middle east convict of , the petroleum producing states imposed an embargo on the export of oil to most of the advanced industrial countries. we have succeeded in creating numerous cooperative mechanisms to protect ourselves, working in concert with our allies, against any future embargoes. the united states would view any attempt to reimpose an embargo as an essentially hostile act. we will oppose discriminatory practices, including boycotts of any type. because we have such fundamental interests in the middle east, it will be our policy to continue our efforts to maintain the balance of power in the mediterranean region. our adversaries must recognize that we will not permit a weakening of our defenses or any attempt to disturb valued alliance relationships in the eastern mediterranean . we shall continue to support peace initiatives in the civil war in lebanon; united states envoys engaged in precisely such an initiative were murdered, and we express our sorrow for their untimely deaths and for all other dedicated government employees who have been slain elsewhere while in service to their country. in lebanon, we stand ready to provide food, medical and other humanitarian assistance. africa the united states has always supported the process of self-determination in africa. our friendship for the african countries is expressed in support for continued peaceful economic development, expansion of trade, humanitarian relief efforts and our belief that the entire continent should be free from outside military intervention. millions of americans recognize their historical and cultural ties with africa and express their desire that united states policy toward africa is a matter of great importance. we support all forces which promote negotiated settlements and racial peace. we shall continue to deplore all violence and terrorism and to urge all concerned that the rights of tribal, ethnic and racial minorities be guaranteed through workable safeguards. our policy is to strengthen the forces of moderation, recognizing that solutions to african problems will not come quickly. the peoples of africa can coexist in security, work together in freedom and harmony, and strive together to secure their prosperity. we hope that the organization of african unity will be able to achieve mature and stable relationships within africa and abroad. the interests of peace and security in africa are best served by the absence of arms and greater concentration on peaceful development. we reserve the right to maintain the balance by extending our support to nations facing a threat from soviet-supplied states and from soviet weapons. united states-soviet relations american foreign policy must be based upon a realistic assessment of the communist challenge in the world. it is clear that the perimeters of freedom continue to shrink throughout the world in the face of the communist challenge. since , totalitarian communism has managed through brute force, not through the free electoral process, to bring an increasingly substantial portion of the world's land area and peoples under its domination. to illustrate, most recently south vietnam, cambodia, and laos have fallen under the control of communist dictatorships, and in that part of the world the communist pressure mounts against thailand, the republic of china, and the republic of korea. in africa, communist cuban forces, brazenly assisted by the soviet union, have recently imposed a communist dictatorship upon the people of angola. other countries in africa and throughout the world generally await similar fates. these are the realities of world power in our time. the united states is thoroughly justified in having based its foreign policy upon these realities. thirty years ago relations between the united states and the soviet union were in a phase of great difficulty, leading to the tensions of the cold war era. although there have been changes in this crucial superpower relationship, there remain fundamental and profound differences between us. republican presidents, while acknowledging the depth of the gulf which separates our free society from soviet society, have sought methodically to isolate and develop those areas of our relations which would serve to lessen tension and reduce the chance of unwanted conflict. in a world beset by countless opportunities for discord and armed conflict, the relationship between the united states and the soviet union is critically important; on it rests the hopes of the world for peace. we offer a policy that maintains our fundamental strength and demonstrates our steadfast determination to prevent aggressive use of soviet power. the role of a responsible, participating congress in maintaining this diplomatic and military posture is critical to success. the united states must remain a loyal and dependable ally, and must be prepared to carry out commitments and to demonstrate a willingness to act. resistance to open aggression, such as the soviet-sponsored cuban intervention in angola, must not be allowed to become the subject of a partisan debate, nor can it be allowed to become an unchallenged and established pattern of international behavior, lest our credibility and deterrent strength be greatly diminished . soviet military power has grown rapidly in recent years, and while we shall prevent a military imbalance or a sudden shift in the global balance of power, we shall also diligently explore with the soviet union new ways to reduce tensions and to arrive at mutually beneficial and self-enforcing agreements in all fields of international activity. important steps have been taken to limit strategic nuclear arms. the vladivostok agreement of november 19t4 placed a ceiling on the strategic forces of both the united states and the soviet union. further negotiations in arms control are continuing. we shall not agree for the sake of agreement; on the contrary we will make sure that any agreements yield fundamental benefits to our national security. as an example of hardheaded bargaining, our success in concluding agreements limiting the size of peaceful nuclear explosions and nuclear weapons tests will, for the first time, permit the united states to conduct on-site inspections in the soviet union itself. this important step can now be measured in practical terms. all such agreements must stand the test of verification. an agreement that does not provide this safeguard is worse than no agreement at all. we support the consolidation of joint efforts with our allies to verify that our policies regarding the transfer of technology to the soviet union and its allies are in concert and that consultation will be designed to preclude the sale of those technology-intensive products to the soviet union by the united states and our allies which will directly or indirectly jeopardize our national security. our trade in nonstrategic areas creates jobs here at home, substantially improves our balance-of-payments position, and can contribute to an improved political climate in the world. the overseas sale of our agricultural products benefits american farmers and consumers. to guard against any sudden shift in domestic prices as the consequence of unannounced purchases, we have instituted strict reporting procedures and other treaty safeguards. we shall not permit concessional sales of agricultural products to the soviet union, nor shall we permit the soviet union or others to determine our agricultural export policies by irregular and unpredictable purchases. the united states and the soviet union remain ideological competitors. we do not shrink from such a challenge; rather, we welcome the opportunity to demonstrate that our way of life is inherently preferable to regimentation and government-enforced orthodoxy. we shall expect the soviet union to implement the united nations declaration on human rights and the helsinki agreements, which guarantee the conditions for the free interchange of information and the right to emigrate, including emigration of soviet jews, christians, moslems and others who wish to join close relatives abroad. in this spirit we shall expect the immediate end of all forms of harassment, including imprisonment and military service, aimed at preventing such emigration. america must take a firm stand to bring about liberalization of emigration policy in countries which limit or prohibit free emigration. governments which enjoy the confidence of their people need have no fear of cultural, intellectual or press freedom. our support for the people of central and eastern europe to achieve self-determination will continue. their ability to choose their future is of great importance to peace and stability. we favor increasing contact between eastern and western europe and support the increasing economic ties of all the countries of europe. we strongly support the continuation of the voice of america, radio free europe and radio liberty with adequate appropriations. strict reciprocity must govern our diplomatic relations with the soviet union. we express our concern for the safety of our diplomatic representatives in the soviet union, and we insist that practices such as microwave transmissions directed at the united states embassy be terminated immediately. thus our relations with the soviet union will be guided by solid principles. we will maintain our strategic and conventional forces; we will oppose the deployment of soviet power for unilateral advantages or political and territorial expansion; we will never tolerate a shift against us in the strategic balance; and we will remain firm in the face of pressure, while at the same time expressing our willingness to work on the basis of strict reciprocity toward new agreements which will help achieve peace and stability. international cooperation strong support for international cooperation in all fields has been a hallmark of united states international policy for many decades. two republican administrations have strengthened agencies of international cooperation not only because of our humanitarian concern for others, but also because it serves united states interests to be a conscientious member of the world community. the political character of the united nations has become complex. with sovereign members, the u.n. experiences problems associated with a large, sometimes cumbersome and diverse body. we seek to accommodate to these changes in the spirit of friendly concern, but when the united nations becomes arrayed against the vital interest of any of its member states on ideological or other narrow grounds, the very principles of the organization are threatened. the united states does not wish to dictate to the u.n., yet we do have every right to expect and insist that scrupulous care be given to the rights of all members. steamroller techniques for advancing discriminatory actions will be opposed. actions such as the malicious attempt to depict zionism as a form of racism are inconsistent with the objectives of the united nations and are repugnant to the united states. the united states will continue to be a firm supporter and defender of any nation subjected to such outrageous assaults. we will not accept ideological abuses in the united states. in the many areas of international cooperation which benefit the average american - elimination of terrorism, peacekeeping, nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, termination of the international drug trade, and orderly use of ocean resources - we pledge to build new international structures of cooperation. at the same time, we shall seek to insure that the cost of such new structures, as well as the cost of existing structures, are more equitably shared among participating nations. in the continued tradition of american concern for the quality of human life everywhere, we shall give vigorous support to the non-political work of the specialized agencies of the united nations which deal with such areas as nutrition and disaster relief for the world's poor and disadvantaged. the united states should promptly withdraw from the international labor organization if that body fails to stop its increasing politicization. eight years ago we pledged to eliminate waste and to make more business-like the administration of united states foreign aid programs. we have endeavored to fulfill these pledges. our foreign economic assistance programs are now being operated efficiently with emphasis on helping others to help themselves, on food production and rural development, on health programs and sound population planning assistance, and on the development of human resources. we have sought to encourage others, including the oil producing countries, to assume a larger share of the burden of assistance. we shall continue our efforts to secure adequate sources of financing for economic projects in emerging countries. the world's oceans, with their vast resources, must become areas of extended cooperation. we favor a successful conclusion to the law of the sea conference provided it will suitably protect legitimate national interests, freedom of the seas and responsible use of the seas. we are determined to maintain the right of free and unmolested passage for ships of all nations on the high seas and in international waterways. we favor an extension of the territorial sea from three to twelve miles, and we favor in principle the creation of a mile economic zone in which coastal states would have exclusive rights to explore and develop natural resources. we strongly condemn illegal corporate payments made at home and abroad. to eliminate illegal payments to foreign officials by american corporations, we support passage of president ford's proposed legislation and the oecd declaration on investment setting forth reasonable guidelines for business conduct. the growth of civilian nuclear technology, and the rising demand for nuclear power as an alternative to increasingly costly fossil fuel resources, combine to require our recognition of the potential dangers associated with such developments. all nations must work to assure that agreements and treaties currently governing nuclear technology and nuclear exports are carefully monitored. we shall work to devise new multilateral policies governing the export of sensitive nuclear technologies. international economic policy the tumultuous events of the past several years in the world economy were an enormous challenge to our creativity and to our capacity for leadership. we have emerged from this difficult period in a new position in the world, and we have directed and guided a sound recovery. to assure the permanence of our own prosperity, we must work with others demonstrating our leadership and the vitality of our economy. together with the industrial democracies, we must ensure steady, non-inflationary growth based on expanded international cooperation. the republican administration will cooperate fully in strengthening the international trade and monetary system, which provides the foundation for our prosperity and that of all nations. we shall bargain hard to remove barriers to an open economic system, and we shall oppose new restrictions to trade. we shall continue to represent vigorously our nation's economic interests in the trade negotiations taking place in geneva, guard against protectionism, and insist that the principles of fair trade be scrupulously observed. when industries and jobs are adversely affected by foreign competition, adjustment assistance under the trade act of is made available. this act must be under continuous review to ascertain that it reflects changing circumstances. the republican party believes that cooperation in the energy field is indispensable to international stability. most of the industrial democracies and the less developed countries are increasingly dependent on imported oil, which causes them to be politically, economically and strategically vulnerable. through the establishment of the international energy agency, steps have been taken to expand consumer cooperation. we shall also continue the dialogue with the oil producing countries we shall continue to work closely with the less-developed countries to promote their economic growth. those countries will be encouraged to enter into mutually beneficial trade relationships with us that contribute to world peace. to achieve this, we must strengthen the confidence of the major industrial countries as they take part in discussions with less-developed countries. there is no reason for us to be defensive; our combined assets can be used in a coordinated strategy to make our influence effective. we will not yield to threats or confrontational politics. while we shall support a global increase of investment in natural resources of all types, we shall also oppose the replacement of the free market mechanism by cartels, price-fixing arrangements or commodity agreements. we shall continue policies designed to assure free market consumers abroad that the united states will remain a dependable supplier of agricultural commodities. conclusion the american people can be proud of our nation's achievements in foreign policy over the past years. we are at peace. we are strong. we re-emphasize the importance of our ties with the nations of the americas. our relations with allies in the atlantic community and with japan have never been closer. significant progress has been made toward a just and durable settlement in the middle east. we have sought negotiation rather than confrontation with our adversaries, while maintaining our strategic deterrent. the world economic recovery, led by the united states, is producing sustainable growth. in this year of our nation's bicentennial, the american people have confidence in themselves and are optimistic about the future. we, the republican party, proudly submit our record and our platform to you.","['preamble',
