Democratic Party,1952,1950,dem_1952.pdf,PDF,"one boldly speaks the truth; the other spreads

To free ourselves from the greatest internal

Despite failures in leadership, they have it in.

their lofty heyitage of spiritual and material
strength; to réject the Socialist policies covertly

public administration; to reorganize our govern-
ment under a leadership invincibly obedient to
our Constitutional mandates. To re-enforce exist-
ing safeguards to our economy of free-enterprises;
to reassert full protection for freedom of speech
and expression and those other freedoms now
threatened; to regain State and community auton-

shaping of American public policy; and to re-
establish our governmental process upon a foun-
dation of faith in our American institutions,
American traditions, and the time-tested adequacy
of American vision.

Many pessimistic voices are being raised today
throughout the land. But the times are full of
hope, if the vision and ‘courage and: faith of the
early pioneer continue to animate the American
people in the discharge of their sovereign responsi-
bilities.

The people have it in their hands to restore
morality, wisdom and vision to the direction of our
foreign and domestic affairs and regain the re-
ligious base which in times past assured general
integrity in public and private life.

Not for a moment do we doubt the decision or

that it will guide the nation to a new and fuller

greatness.
In this unusual assignment we feel a deep con-
sciousness of the nature and gravity of the crusade

473

CAMPAIGN OF 1952 —

‘ upon which we now embatk—a crusade to which

all sound and patriotic Americans, irrespective of
party, may well dedicate their hearts and minds
and fullest effort. Only thus can our beloved
country restore its spiritual and temporal strength
and regain once again the universal respect.

Democratic Party Platform of 1952
PREAMBLE

Our nation has entered into an age in which
Divine Providence has permitted the genius of
man to unlock the secret of the atom.

No system of government can survive the chal-
lenge of an atomic era unless its administration is
committed to the stewardship of a trustee imbued
with a democratic faith, a buoyant hope for the
future, the charity of brotherhood, and the vision
to translate these ideals into the realities of human
government. The Government of the United
States, administered by the Democratic Party, is
today so entrusted.

The free choice of the Democratic Party by the
people of America as the. instrument to achieve
that purpose will mean world peace with honor,
national security based on collective pacts with
other free nations, and a high level of human
dignity. National survival demands that these
goals be attained, and the endowments of the
Democratic Party alone can assure their attain-
ment.

For twenty years, under the dedicated guidance |
of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry S. Tru-
man, our country has moved steadily along the
road which has led the United States of America
to world leadership in the cause of freedom.

We will not retreat one inch along that road.
Rather, it is our prayerful hope that the people,
whom we have so faithfully served, will renew
the mandate to continue our service and that Al-
mighty God may grant us the wisdom to succeed.

TWENTY YEARS OF PROGRESS
Achieving Prosperity

An objective appraisal of the past record clearly
demonstrates that the Democratic Party has been
the chosen American instrument to achieve pros-
perity, build a stronger democracy, erect the struc-
ture of world peace, and continue on the path of
progress.


474 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

Democratic Party policies and programs rescued
American business from total collapse—from the
fatal economic. consequences of watered stock,
unsound banks, useless and greedy holding com-
panies, high tariff barriers, and predatory business
practices, all of which prevailed under the last
- Republican administrations. Democratic policies
have enabled the Federal Government to help all
business, small and large, to achieve the highest
rate of productivity, the widest domestic and
world markets, and the largest profits in the his-
tory of the Nation.

The simple fact is that today theré are more
than four million operating business enterprises in
this country, over one million more than existed
in 1932. Corporate losses in that fateful year were
over three billion dollars; in 1951, corporate
profits, after taxes, reached the staggering total of
eighteen billion.

Democratic policies and programs rescued
American agriculture from the economic conse-
quences of blight, drought, flood and storm, from
oppressive and indiscriminate foreclosures, and
from the ruinous conditions brought about by the
bungling incompetence and neglect of the pre-
ceding twelve years of Republican maladministra-
tion. Economic stability, soil conservation, rural
electrification, farm dwelling improvement, in-
creased production and efficiency and more than
sevenfold ‘increase in cash income have been the
return to farmers for their faith in the Democratic
Party.

Democratic labor policies have rescued the
wage earners in this country from mass unem-
ployment and from sweatshop slavery at starvation
wages. Under our Democratic administrations,
decent hours, decent wages, and decent working
conditions have become the rule rather than the
exception.

Self organizations of labor unions and collective
bargaining, both of which are the keystone to
labor management, peace and prosperity, must be
encouraged, for the good of all. ;

Unemployment is now less than 3 per cent of
the labor force, compared with almost 25 per cent
in 1982. Trade union membership has reached
a total of 16 million, which is more than five times
the total of 1932.

The welfare of all economic and social groups
in our society has been promoted by the sound,
progressive and humane policies of the Demo-
cratic Party.

‘Strengthening Democracy

We are convinced that lasting prosperity must

_ be founded upon a healthy democratic society

respectful of the rights of all people.

Under Democratic Party leadership more has
been done in the past twenty years to enhance the
sanctity of individual rights than ever before in
our history. Racial and religious minorities have
progressed further toward real equality than dur-
ing the preceding 150 years.

Governmental services, Democratically admin-
istered, have been improved and extended. The
efficiency, economy, and integration of Federal
operations have been advocated and effectuated
through sound programs and policies. Through
cooperative programs of Federal aid, State and
local governments have been encouraged and en-
abled to provide many more services.

The Democratic Party has been alert to the
corroding and demoralizing effects of dishonesty
and disloyalty in the public service. It has ex-
posed and punished those who would corrupt
the integrity of the public service, and it has
always championed honesty and morality in gov-
ernment. The loyalty program of President Tru-
man has served effectively to prevent infiltration
by subversive elements and to protect honest and
loyal’ public servants against unfounded and
malicious attacks.

We commend the relentless and fearless actions
of Congressional Committees which, under vigor-
ous Democratic leadership, have exposed derelic-
tion in public service, and we pledge our support
to a continuance of such actions as conditions re-
quire them.

The administration of our government by the
Democratic Party has been based upon principles
of justice and equity, and upon the American
tradition of fair play. Men who are elected to
high political office are entrusted with high re-
sponsibilities. Slander, defamation of character,
deception and dishonesty are as truly transgres-
sions of God’s commandments, when resorted to
by men in public life, as they are for all other
men.

Building Peace with Honor
The Democratic Party has worked constantly
for peace—lasting peace, peace with honor, free-

‘dom, justice and security for all nations.

The return of the Democratic Party to power in
1933 marked the end of a tragic era of isolation-


ism fostered by Republican Administrations which -

had deliberately and callously rejected the golden
opportunity created by Woodrow Wilson for col-
lective action to secure the peace.

This folly contributed to the second World War.
Victory in that war has presented the nations of
the world a new opportunity which the Demo-
cratic Party is determined shall not be lost.

- We have helped establish the instrumentalities
through which the hope of mankind for universal

world peace can be realized. Under Democratic

leadership, our Nation has moved promptly and
effectively to meet and repel the menace to world
peace by Soviet imperialism.

Progress in the New Era

The Democratic Party believes that past prog-
ress is but a prelude to the human aspirations
which may be realized in the future.

Under Democratic Party leadership, America
has accepted each new challenge of history and
has found practical solutions to meet and over-
come them. This we have done without departing
from the principles of our basic philosophy, that
is, the destiny of man to achieve his earthly ends

‘in the spirit of brotherhood.

A great Democrat—Franklin Delano Roosevelt
—devised the programs of the New Deal to meet
the pressing problems of the 1930s. Another great
Democrat—Harry S. Truman—devised the pro-
grams of the Fair Deal to meet the complex prob-
lems of America in the 1940s. The Democratic
Party is ready to face and solve the challenging
problems of the 1950s, We dedicate ourselves
to the: magnificent work of these great Presi-
dents and to mould and adapt their democratic
principles to the new problems of the years
ahead.

' In this spirit we adopt and pledge ourselves to
this, the Democratic platform for 1952:

Our Goat Is PEAcE witrH Honor

Peace with honor is the greatest of all our goals.

We pledge our unremitting efforts to avert an-
other world war. We are determined that the
people shall be spared that frightful agony.

We are convinced that peace and security can
be safeguarded if America does not deviate from
the practical and successful policies developed
under Democratic leadership since the close of
World War II. We will resolutely move ahead
with the constructive task of promoting peace.

CAMPAIGN OF 1952 475

THe DeMocrRATIC PROGRAM FOR PEACE AND
NATIONAL SECURITY ,

Supporting the United Nations

Under Democratic leadership, this country
sponsored and helped create the United Nations
and became a charter member and _ staunchly
supports its aims.

We will continue our efforts to strengthen the
United Nations, improve its institutions as ex-
perience requires, and foster its growth and de-
velopment. . ,

The Communist aggressor has been hurled back
from South Korea. Thus, Korea has proved, once
and for all, that the United Nations will resist
aggression. We urge continued effort, by every
honorable means, to bring about a fair and effec-
tive peace settlement in Korea in accordance with
the principles of the United Nations’ charter.

Strong National Defense

Our Nation has strengthened its national de-
fenses against the menace of Soviet aggression.

The Democratic Party will continue to stand
unequivocally for the strong, balanced defense
forces for this country—land, sea and air. We will
continue to support the expansion and mainte-
nance of the military and civil defense forces re-
quired for our national security. We reject the
defeatist view of those who say we cannot afford
the expense and effort necessary to defend our-
selves. We express our full confidence in the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. We voice complete faith in the
ability and valor of our armed forces, and pride
in their accomplishments.

COLLECTIVE STRENGTH FOR THE FREE WorLpD

We reject the ridiculous notions of those who
would have the United States face the aggressors
alone. That would be the most expensive—and
the most dangerous—method of seeking security.
This nation needs strong allies, around the world,
making their maximum contribution to the com-
mon defense. They add their strength to ours in
the defense of freedom.

The Truman Doctrine in 1947, the organization
of hemisphere defense at Rio de Janeiro that same
year, the Marshall Plan in 1948, the North At-
lantic Treaty in 1949, the Point IV program, the
resistance to Communist aggression in Korea, the
Pacific Security pacts in 1951, and the Mutual
Security programs now under way—all stand as


476 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

landmarks of America’s progress in mobilizing the
strength of the free world to keep the peace.

Encouraging European Unity

We encourage the economic and political unity
of free Europe and the increasing solidarity of the
nations of the North Atlantic Community.

We hail the Schuman Plan to pool the basic
resources of industrial. Western Europe, and the
European Defense Community. We are proud of
America’s part in carrying these great projects
forward, and we pledge our continuing support
until they are established. ,

Support for Free Germany

We welcome the German Federal Republic
into the company of free nations. We are deter-
mined that Germany shall remain free and con-
tinue as a good neighbor in the European com-
munity. We sympathize with the German people’s

- wish for unity and will continue to do everything
we can by peaceful means to overcome the Krem-
lin’s obstruction of that rightful aim.

Support for the Victims of Soviet Imperialism

We will not abandon the once-free peoples of -

Central and Eastern Europe who suffer now under
the Kremlin’s tyranny in violation of the Soviet
Union’s most solemn pledges at Tehran, Yalta, and
Potsdam. The United States should join other
nations in formally declaring gendcide to be an
international crime in time of peace as well as
war. This crime was exposed once more by the
shocking revelations of Soviet guilt as disclosed
in the report filed in Congress by the special com-
mittee investigating the Katyn Forest massacre.
We look forward to the day when the liberties of
Poland and the other oppressed Soviet satellites,
including Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania,
Bulgaria, Albania, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia
and other nations in Asia under Soviet domi-
nation, will be restored to them and they can
again take their rightful place in. the community
of free nations. We will carry forward and ex-
pand the vital and effective program of the “Voice
of America” for penetration of the “Iron Curtain,”
bringing truth and hope to all the people subju-
gated by the Soviet Empire.

Support for the Nations of the Middle East

We seek to enlist the people of the Middle East
to work with us and with each other in the de-

velopment of the region, the lifting of health and
living standards, and the attainment of peace. We
favor the development of integrated security ar-
rangements for the Middle East and other assist-
ance to help safeguard the independence of the
countries in the area.

We pledge continued assistance to Israel. so
that she may fulfill her humanitarian mission of
providing shelter and sanctuary for her homeless
Jewish refugees while strengthening her economic
development.

We will continue to support the tripartite decla-
ration of May 1950, to encourage Israel and the
Arab States to settle their differences by direct
negotiation, to maintain and protect the sanctity
of the Holy Places and to permit free access to
them.

We pledge aid to the Arab States to enable
them to develop their economic resources and
raise the living standards of their people. We
support. measures for the relief and reintegration
of the Palestine refugees, and we pledge continued
assistance to the reintegration program voted by
the General Assembly of the United Nations in
January 1952.

South Asia: A Testing Ground for Democracy

In the subcontinent of South Asia, we pledge
continuing support for the great new countries of
India and Pakistan in their efforts to create a bet-
ter life for their people and build strong demo-
cratic governments to stand as bastions of liberty
in Asia, secure against the threat of Communist
subversion.

Collective Security in the Pacific

We welcome free Japan as a friendly neighbor
and an ally in seeking security and progress for
the whole Pacific area. America’s security pacts
with Japan and with the Philippines, Australia,
and New Zealand are indispenseble steps toward
comprehensive mutual security arrangements in
that area. Our military and economic assistance
to the Nationalist Government of China on For-
mosa has strengthened that vital outpost of the
free world, and will be continued.

Strengthening the Americas

In the Western Hemisphere, we pledge our-
selves to continue the policy of the good neighbor.
We will strive constantly to strengthen the bonds
of friendship and coeperation with our Latin


American allies who are joined with us in the
defense of the Americas.

Disarmament Remains the Goal

The free world is rearming to secure the peace.
Under Democratic leadership, America always
stands prepared to join in a workable system for
foolproof inspection and limitation of all arma-
ments, including atomic weapons. This Nation
has taken the leadership in proposing concrete,
practical plans for such a system. We are de-
termined to carry on the effort for real, effective
disarmament.

We look forward to the day when a great share
of the resources now devoted to the armaments
program can be diverted: into the channels of
peaceful production to speed the progress of
America and of the underdeveloped regions of
the world.

Helping Other People to Help Themselves

Even though we cannot now disarm, we will go
forward as rapidly as possible in developing the
imaginative and farsighted concept of President
Truman embodied in the Point IV program.

We will continue to encourage use of American
skills and capital in helping the people of under-
developed lands to combat disease, raise living
standards, improve land tenure and develop in-
dustry and trade. The continuance of ever
stronger and more vigorous Point IV programs—
sponsored both by this country and by the United
Nations—is an indispensable element in creating
a peaceful world.

Upholding the Principle of Self-Determination .

In an era when the “satellite state” symbolizes
both the tyranny of the aggressor nations and
the extinction of liberty in small nations, the
Democratic Party reasserts and reaffirms the Wil-
sonian principle of the right of national self-
determination. It is part of the policy of the
Democratic Party, therefore, to encourage and
assist small nations and all peoples in the peaceful
and orderly achievement of their legitimate aspi-
rations toward political, geographical and ethnic
integrity so that they may dwell in the family of
sovereign nations with freedom and dignity.

Expanding World Trade

The Democratic Party has always stood for
expanding trade among free nations. We reassert

CAMPAIGN OF 1952 477

that stand today. We vigorously oppose any
restrictive policies which would weaken the highly
successful reciprocal trade program fathered by
Cordell Hull.

Since 1934, the United States has taken the lead
in fostering the expansion and liberalization of
world trade.

Our own economy requires expanded export
markets for our manufactured and agricultural
products and ‘a greater supply of essential im-
ported raw materials. At the same time, our
friends throughout the world will have oppor-
tunity to earn their own way to higher living
standards with lessened dependence on our aid.

Progressive Immigration Policies

‘ Solution of the problem of refugees from com-
munism and over-population has become a per-
manent part of the foreign policy program of the
Democratic Party. We pledge continued coopera-
tion with other free nations to solve it.

We pledge continued aid to refugees from com-
munism and the enactment of President Truman’s
proposals for legislation in this field. In this way
we can give hope and courage to the victims of
Soviet brutality and can carry on the humanitarian
tradition of the Displaced Persons Act.

Subversive elements must be screened out and
prevented from entering our land, but the gates
must be left open for practical numbers of desira-
ble persons from abroad whose immigration to

this country provides an invigorating infusion into-

the stream of American life; as well as a significant
contribution to the solution of the world refugee
and over-population problems.

We pledge continuing revision of our. immi-
gration and naturalization laws to do away with
any unjust and unfair practices against national
groups which have contributed some of our best
citizens. We will eliminate distinctions between
nativeborn and naturalized citizens. We want no
“second-class” citizens in free America.

Our Domestic PoLicy

Economic Opportunity and Growth
The United States is today a land of boundless
opportunity. Never before has it offered such a
large measure of prosperity, security and hope for
all its people.
Horizons of even greater abundance and oppor-

tunity lie before us under a Democratic Adminis- .

tration responsive to the will of the people.


478 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

The Democratic Administration has had a
guiding principle since taking office 20 years ago:
that the prosperity and growth of this Nation are
indivisible. Every step we have taken to help the
farmers has also helped the workers and business.
Every improvement in the status of the worker
has helped both farmers and business. Every ex-
pansion of business has provided more jobs for
workers and greater demand for farm products.

‘A STABILIZED ECONOMY
Combatting Inflation

The Democratic Administration early recog-
nized that defense production would limit the
amount of goods in civilian markets, and subject
our economy to heavy inflationary pressure. To
prevent this from resulting in ruinous inflation,
the Administration proposed pay-as-we-go taxation
to keep the national debt as low as possible and
to prevent excess money pressure on scarce goods
and services.

Direct controls were also proposed to channel
scarce materials into highly essential defense pro-
duction, and to keep prices down.

In 1951 and 1952 Republican Congressmen
demonstrated their attitude toward these neces-
sary measures when they sponsored amendments
which would have destroyed all controls.

Prices

We shall strive to redress the injury done to
the American people—especially to white collar
workers and fixed-income families—by the weak-
ening amendments which the Republicans in
Congress have forced into our anti-inflation laws.

We pledge continuance of workable controls so
long as the emergency requires them. We pledge
fair and impartial enforcement of controls and
their removal as quickly as economic conditions
allow.

Rents

We strongly urge continued federal rent control
in critical defense areas and in the many other
localities still suffering from a substantial shortage
of adequate housing at reasonable prices.

Full Employment
The Democratic Administration prudently
passed the Employment Act of 1946 declaring it
. to be national policy never again to permit large-

scale unemployment to stalk the land. We will
assure the transition from defense production to
peace-time production without the ravages of un-
employment. We pledge ourselves at all times to
the maintenance of maximum employment, pro-
duction, and purchasing power in the American
economy.

Integrity in Government Finances

We solemnly pledge the preservation ‘of the
financial strength of the Government. We have
demonstrated our ability to maintain and enhance
the nation’s financial strength. In the six full
fiscal years since V-J Day, our fiscal policy has
produced a $4 billion budget surplus. We have
reduced the public debt $17 billion from the
postwar peak,

We have demonstrated our ability to make
fiscal policy contribute in a positive way to eco-
nomic growth and the maintenance of high-level

employment. The policies which have been fol- —

lowed have given us the greatest prosperity in our
history. Sustained. economic expansion has pro-
vided the funds necessary to finance our defense
and has still left our people with record high
consumer incomes and business with a record
volume of investment. Employment and personal
incomes are at record levels. Never have Ameéri-
cans enjoyed a higher standard of living and saved
more for contingencies and old age.

Federal Taxes

We believe in fair and equitable taxation. We
oppose a Federal general sales tax. We adhere to
the principle of ability to pay. We have enacted
an emergency excess profits tax to prevent profit-
eering from the defense program and have vigor-
ously attacked special tax privileges.

Tax Reductions

In the future, as in the past, we will hold firm
to policies consistent with sound financing and
continuing economic progress. As rapidly as de-
fense requirements permit, we favor’ reducing
taxes, especially for people with lower incomes.
But we will not imperil our Nation’s security by
making reckless promises to reduce taxes. We
deplore irresponsible assertions that national se-
curity can be achieved without paying for it.

Closing Tax Loopholes
Justice requires the elimination of tax loopholes


which favor special groups. We pledge continued
efforts to the elimination of remaining loopholes.

Government Expenditures

We believe in keeping government expenditures
to the lowest practicable level. The great bulk of
‘our’ national budget consists of obligations in-
curred for defense purposes. We pledge ourselves
_ to a vigilant review of our expenditures in order
to reduce them as much as possible.

THe AMERICAN FARMER AND AGRICULTURE

We know that national prosperity depends upon
a vigorous, productive and expanding agriculture.

We take great pride in our Party’s record of
performance and ‘in the impressive gains made by
American agriculture in the last two decades.
Under programs of Democratic Administrations
the net agricultural income has increased from
less than two billion dollars to almost fifteen bil-
lion dollars. These programs must be continued
and improved.

Resource Conservation

The. soil resources of our country have been
conserved and strengthened through the Soil Con-
servation Service, the Agricultural. Conservation
Program, the Forestry and the Research programs,
with their incentives to increased production
through sound conservation farming. These pro-
grams have revolutionized American agriculture
and must be continued and expanded. We will
accelerate programs of upstream flood prevention,
‘watershed protection, and soil, forest and water
conservation in all parts of the country. These
conservation measures are a national necessity;
they are invaluable to our farmers, and add greatly
to the welfare of all Americans and of generations
yet unborn.

Grass Roots Administration

We will continue the widest possible farmer
participation through referenda, farmer-elected
committees, local soil conservation districts, and
self-governing agencies in the conduct and ad-
ministration of these truly democratic programs,
initiated and developed under Democratic ad-
minstrations.

Price Supports
Under the present farm program, our farmers

CAMPAIGN OF. 1952 479

have performed magnificently and have achieved
unprecedented production. We applaud the re-
cent Congressional action in setting aside the
“sliding scale” for price support through 1954, and
we will continue to protect the producers of basic
agricultural commodities under the terms of a
mandatory price support program at not less than
ninety percent of parity. We continue to advocate

‘practical methods for extending price supports to

other storables and to the-producers of perishable
commodities, which account for three-fourths of
all farm income.

Abundant Production

We will continue to assist farmers in providing
abundant and stable supplies of agricultural com-
modities for the consumers at reasonable ‘prices,
and in assuring the farmer the opportunity to earn
a fair return commensurate with that enjoyed by
other segments of the American economy.

The agricultural adjustment programs encour-
age the production of abundant supplies while
enabling producers to keep supply in line with
consumer demand, preventing wide fluctuations
and bringing stability to the agricultural income
of the Nation. We pledge retention of such pro-
grams.

We pledge continued efforts to provide ade-
quate storage facilities for grain and other farm
products with sufficient capacity for needed re-
serves for defense, and other emergency require-
ments, in order to. protect the integrity of the
farm price support programs.

Research

We are justly proud of the outstanding achieve-
ments of our agricultural research, We favor a
greatly expanded research and education program
for American agriculture in order that both pro-
duction and distribution may more effectively
serve consumers and producers alike, and thus
meet the needs of the modern world. We favor
especial emphasis on the development of new
crops and varieties, on crop and livestock disease
and pest control, and on agricultural statistics and
marketing services.

Marketing

We must find profitable markets for the prod-
ucts of our farms, and we should produce all that
these ‘markets will absorb. To this end we will


480 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

continue our efforts to reduce trade barriers, both
at home and abroad, to provide better marketing
and inspection facilities, and to find new uses and
outlets for our foods and fibers both in domestic
and foreign markets.

Farm Credit

We have provided credit facilities for all agri-
. culture, including means by which young men,
veterans of military service, and farm tenants have
been encouraged to become farmers and farm
home-owners, and through which low-income
farmers have been assisted in establishing self-
sustaining and fully productive farm units. We
will not waver in our efforts to provide such
incentives.

Crop Insurance

Crop insurance to protect farmers against loss
from destruction of their crops by natural causes
has been created and developed under Demo-
cratic Administrations into a sound business opera-
tion. This program should be expanded as rapidly
as experience justifies, in order that its benefits
may be made available to every farmer.

Rural Electrification

Democratic Administrations have established
the great Rural Electrification Program, which has
brought light and power to the rural homes of our
Nation. In 1985, only 10% of the farm homes of
America had the benefits of electricity. Today
85% of our rural homes enjoy the benefits of
electric light and power. We will continue to
fight to make electricity available to all rural
homes, with adequate facilities for the generation
and transmission of power. Through the Rural
Telephone Program, inaugurated by the Demo-
cratic 81st Congress, we will provide the op-
portunity for every farm home to have this modern
essential service. We pledge support of these self-
liquidating farm programs.

Cooperatives

We wil! continue to support the sound develop-
ment and growth of bona fide farm cooperatives
and to protect them from punitive taxation.

Defense Needs
We will continue to recognize agriculture as an

essential defense industry, and to assist in pro-
viding all the necessary tools, machinery, fertilizer,
and manpower needed by farmers in meeting pro-
duction goals.

Family Farming

The family farm is the keystone of American
agriculture. We will strive unceasingly to make
the farm homes of our country healthier and hap-
pier places in which to live. We must see that
our youth continues to find attractive opportunity
in the field of agriculture. ~

The Republican Party platform is loud in its
criticism of our great farm programs. We chal-
lenge Republicans and other enemies of farm
progress to justify their opposition to the program
now in operation, to oppose the improvements
here proposed, or to advocate repeal of a single
vital part of our program.

A Fam DEAL For WorKERS
Good Incomes

There can be-no national prosperity unless our
working men and women continue to prosper and
enjoy rising living standards. The rising produc-
tivity of American workers is a key to our un-
paralleled industrial progress. Good incomes for
our workers are the secret of our great and grow-
ing consumer markets.

Labor-Management Relations

Good labor-management relations are essential
to good incomes for wage earners and rising out-
put from our factories. We believe that to the
widest possible extent consistent with the public
interest, management and labor should determine
wage rates and conditions of employment throug
free collective bargaining.

Taft-Hartley Act

We strongly advocate the repeal of the Taft-
Hartley Act.

The Taft-Hartley Act has been proved to be
inadequate, unworkable, and unfair. It interferes
in an arbitrary manner with collective bargaining,

tipping the scales in favor of management against.

labor.

The Taft-Hartley Act has revived the injunction
as a weapon against labor in industrial relations.
The Act has arbitrarily forbidden traditional hiring


practices which are desired by both management
and labor in many industries. The Act has forced
workers to act as strikebreakers against their
fellow unionists. The Act has served to interfere
with one of the most. fundamental rights of
American workers—the right to organize in unions
of their own choosing.

We deplore the fact that the Taft-Hartley Act
provides an inadequate and unfair means of meet-
ing with national emergency situations. We advo-
cate legislation that will enable the President to
deal fairly and effectively with cases where a
breakdown: in collective bargaining seriously
threatens the national safety or welfare.

In keeping with the. progress of the times, and
based on past experiences, a new legislative ap-
proach toward the entire labor management prob-
lem should be explored. .

Fair Labor Standards

We pledge to continue our efforts so that gov-
ernment programs designed to establish improved
fair labor standards shall prove a means of. assur-
ing minimum wages, hours and protection to
workers, consistent with present-day progress.

Equal Pay for Equal Work

We believe in equal pay for equal work, regard-
less of sex, and we urge legislation to make that
principle effective.

The Physically-Handicapped

We promise to further the program to afford
employment opportunities both in government and
in private industry for physically handicapped
persons.

Migratory Workers
We advocate prompt improvement of employ-

ment. conditions of migratory workers and in-
creased protection of their safety and health.

STRENGTHENING FREE ENTERPRISE

The free enterprise system has flourished and
prospered in America during these last twenty
years as never before. This has been made pos-
sible by the purchasing power of all our people
and we are determined that the broad base of our
prosperity. shall be maintained.

Small and Independent Business

Small and independent business is the backbone
of Amcrican free enterprise. Upon its health de-
pends the growth of the economic system whose
competitive spirit has built this Nation’s industrial
strength and provided its workers and consumers
with an incomparably high standard of living.

Independent business is the best offset to
monopoly practices. The Government’s role is to
insure that independent business receives equally
fair treatment with its competitors.

Congress has established the permanent Small
Business Committee of the Senate and the Special
Small Business Committee of the House, which
have continued to render great service to this im-
portant segment of. our economy. We favor con-
tinuance of both these committees with all the
powers to investigate and report conditions, cor-
rect discriminations, and propose needed. legis-
lation.

We pledge ourselvés to increased efforts to
assure that small business be given equal oppor-
tunity. to participate in Government contracts, and
that a suitable proportion of the dollar volume of
defense contracts be channeled into independent
small business. The Small Defense Plants Ad-
ministration, which our Party caused to be estab-
lished, should retain its independent status and
be made a continuing: agency, equipped with
sufficient lending powers to assist qualified small
business in securing defense contracts. .

We urge the enactrnent of such laws as will
provide favorable incentives to the establishment
and survival of independent businesses, especially
in the provision of tax incentives and access to
equity or risk capital.

Enforcement of Anti-Trust Laws

Free competitive enterprise must remain free
and competitive if the productive forces of. this
Nation are to remain strong. We are alarmed over
the increasing concentration of economic power
in the hands of a few.

We reaffirm our belief in the necessity of vigor-
ous. enforcement of the laws against trusts, com-
binations, and restraints of trade, which laws are
vital to the safeguarding of the public interest and
of small competitive business men against preda-
tory monopolies. We will seek adequate appro-


482 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

priations for the Department of Justice and the
Federal Trade Commission for vigorous investi-
gation and for enforcement of the anti-trust laws.
We support the right of all persons to work to-
gether in cooperatives and other democratic asso-
ciations for the purpose of carrying out any proper

business operations free from any arbitrary and.

discriminatory restrictions.

Protection of Investors and Consumers

We must avoid unnecessary business controls.
But we cannot close our eyes to the special prob-
lems which require Government surveillance. The
Government must continue its efforts to stop un-
fair selling practices which deceive investors, and
unfair trade practices which deceive consumers.

Transportation

In the furtherance of national defense and
commerce, we pledge continued Government sup-
port, on a sound financial basis, for further de-
velopment of the Nation’s transportation systems,
land, sea and air. We endorse a policy of fostering
the safest and most reliable air transportation
system of the world. We favor fair, nondiscrimina-
tory freight rates to encourage economic growth
in all parts of the country.

Highways

In cooperation with State and local govern-
mental units, we will continue to plan, coordinate,
finance, and encourage the expansion of our road
and highway network, including access roads, for
the dual purposes of national defense and efficient
motor transportation. We support expansion of
farm-to-market roads.

Rivers and Harbors

We pledge continued development of our -har-
bors and waterways.
Merchant Marine

We will continue to: encourage and support an

adequate Merchant Marine. .

Our Natura REsouRCES

The United States has been blessed with the
richest natural resources of any nation on earth.

Yet, unless we redouble our conservation efforts
we will become a “have-not” nation in some of
the most important raw materials upon which

depend our industries, agriculture, employment
and high standard of living. This can be prevented
by a well rounded and nation-wide conservation
effort.

Land and Water Resources

We favor sound, progressive development of
the Nation’s land and water resources for
flood control, navigation, irrigation, power, drain-
age, soil conservation and creation of new, small
family-sized farms, with immediate action in criti-
cal areas.

We favor the acceleration of all such projects,
including construction of transmission facilities to
load centers for wider and more equitable distri-
bution of electric energy at the lowest cost to the
consumer with continuing preference to public
agencies and REA Cooperatives.

The Democratic Party denounces all obstruc-
tionist devices designed to prevent or retard utili-
zation of the Nation’s power and water resources
for the benefit of the people, their enterprises and
interests.

The wise policy of the Democratic Party in en-

 couraging multipurpose projects throughout the

country is responsible for America’s productive
superiority over any nation in the world and is one
of the greatest single factors leading toward the
accomplishment of world peace. Without these
projects our atomic weapons program could never
have been achieved, and without additional such
projects it cannot be expanded.

The Democratic Party is dedicated to a continu-
ation of the natural resources development policy
inaugurated and carried out under the administra-
tions of Presidents Roosevelt and Truman, and to
the extension of that policy to all parts of the
Nation—North, South, East, Midwest, West and
the territories to the end that the Nation and its
people receive maximum benefits from these re-
sources to which they have an inherent right.

The Democratic Party further pledges itself to
protect these resources from destructive monopoly
and exploitation.

River Basin Development

We pledge the continued full and unified re-
gional development of the water, mineral and
other natural resources of the nation, recognizing
that the progress already achieved under the
initiative of the Democratic Party in the arid and


semi-arid States of the West, as well as in the
Tennessee Valley, is only an indication: of still
greater results which can: be accomplished.

Fertilizer Development

Great. farming areas, particularly of the Mid-
west and West, are in acute need of low-cost
commercial fertilizers. To meet this demand, we
favor the opening of the Nation’s phosphate rock
deposits in the West, through prompt provision
of sufficient low-cost hydro-electric power to de-
velop this great resource.

Forests and Public Lands

We seek to establish and demonstrate such suc-
cessful policies of forest and land management on
‘Federal property as will materially assist State and
private owners in their conservation efforts. Con-
servation of forest and range lands is vital to the
strength and welfare of the Nation. Our forest
and range lands must be protected and used
wisely in order to produce a continuing supply
of basic raw materials for industry; to reduce
damaging floods; and to preserve the sources of
priceless water. With adequate appropriations to
carry out feasible projects, we pledge a program
of forest protection, reforestation projects and
sound practices of production and_ harvesting
- which will promote sustained yields of forest crops.

We propose to increase forest access roads in
order to improve cutting practices on both public
and private lands.

On the public land ranges we pledge continu-
ance of effective conservation and use programs,
including the extension of water pond construc-
tion and restoration of forage cover.

Arid Areas

In many areas of the Nation assistance is
needed to provide water for irrigation, domestic
and industrial purposes. We pledge that in work-

_ ing out programs for rational distribution of water
from Federal sources we will aid in delivering
this essential of life cheaply and abundantly.

Minerals and Fuels

The Nation’s minerals and fuels are essential to
the national defense and development of our
country. We pledge the adoption of policies which
will further encourage the exploration and de-
velopment of additional reserves of our mineral

CAMPAIGN OF 1952 483

resources. We subscribe to the principles of the
Stockpiling Act and will lend our efforts to
strengthening and expanding its provisions and
those of the Defense Production Act to meet our
military and civilian needs. Additional access
roads should be constructed with Government aid.
Our synthetic fuels, including monetary metals,
research program should go forward. Laws to aid
and assist these objectives will be advocated.

Domestic Fisheries

We favor increased research and exploration
for conserving and better utilizing fishery re-
sources; expanded research and education to pro-
mote new fishery products and uses and new
markets; promotion of world trade in fish products;
a public works and water policy providing ade-
quate protection for domestic fishery resources;
and treaties with other nations for. conservation
and better utilization of international fisheries.

Wildlife Recreations

In our highly complex civilization, outdoor rec-
reation has become essential to the health and
happiness of our people.

The Democratic Party has devoted its efforts to
the preservation, restoration and increase of the
bird, animal and fish life which abound in this
Nation. State, local and private agencies have
cooperated in this worthy endeavor. We have ex-
tended and vastly improved the parks, forests,
beaches, streams, preserves and wilderness areas
across the land.

To the 28,000,000 of our citizens who annually
purchase fishing and hunting licenses, we pledge
continued efforts to improve all recreational areas.

ATOMIC ENERGY

In the field of atomic energy, we pledge our-

selves:

(1) to maintain vigorous and non-partisan
civilian administrations, with adequate security
safeguards;

(2) to promote the development. of nuclear
energy for peaceful purposes in the interests of
America and mankind;

(3) to build all the atomic and hydrogen fire-
power needed to defend our country, deter ag-
“gression, and promote world peace;

(4) To exert every effort to bring about bona


484 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

fide international control and inspection of all
atomic weapons.

SocitaL SECURITY

Our national system of social security, con-
ceived and developed by the Democratic Party,
needs to be extended and improved.

Old Age and Survivors Insurance

We favor further strengthening of old age and
survivors insurance, through such improvements
as increasing benefits, extending them to more

people and’ lowering the retirement age for

women.

We favor the complete elimination of the work
clause for the reason that those contributing to
the Social Security program should be permitted
to draw benefits, upon reaching the age of eligi-
bility, and still continue to work.

Unemployment Insurance

We favor a stronger system of unemployment
insurance, with broader coverage and substantially
increased benefits, including an allowance for de-
pendents.

Public Assistance

We favor further improvements in public assist-
ance programs for the blind, the disabled, the
aged and children in order to help our less for-
tunate citizens meet the needs of daily living.

Private Plans

We favor and encourage the private endeavors
of social agencies, mutual associations, insurance
companies, industry-labor groups, and cooperative
societies to provide against the. basic hazards of
life through mutually agreed upon benefit plans
designed to complement our present social security
program.

Needs of Our Aging Citizens

Our older citizens constitute an immense reser-
voir of skilled, mature judgment and ripened ex-
perience. We pledge ourselves to give full recog-

‘nition to the right of our older citizens to lead a
proud, productive and independent life through-
out their years.

In addition to the fundamental improvements
in Old Age and Survivors Insurance, which are
outlined above, we pledge ourselves, in coopera-

tion with the States and private industry, to en-
courage the employment of older workers. We
commend the 82nd Congress for eliminating the
age restriction on employment in the Federal Gov-
ernment.

Health

We will continue to work for better health for
every American, especially our children. We
pledge continued and wholehearted support for
the campaign that modern medicine is waging
against mental illness, cancer, heart disease and
other diseases.

‘ Research

We favor continued and vigorous support, from
private and public sources, of research into the
causes, prevention and cure of disease.

Medical Education

We advocate Federal aid for medical education
to help overcome the growing shortages of doctors,
nurses, and other trained health personnel.

Hospitals and Health Centers

We pledge continued support for Federal aid
to hospital construction. We pledge increased
Federal aid to promote public health through
preventive programs and health services, espe-
cially in rural areas.

Cost of M. edical Care

We also advocate a resolute attack on the heavy
financial hazard of serious illness. We recognize
that the costs of modern medical care have grown
to be prohibitive for many millions of people. We
commend President Truman for establishing the
non-partisan Commission on the Health Needs of
the Nation to seek an acceptable solution of this
urgent problem.

Housing

We pledge ourselves to the- fulfillment of the
programs of private housing, public low-rent
housing, slum clearance, urban redevelopment,
farm housing and housing research as authorized
by the Housing Act of 1949.

We deplore the efforts of special interests
groups, which themselves have prospered through
Government guarantees of housing mortgages, to


destroy those programs adopted to assist families
of low-income.

Additional Legislation

We pledge ourselves to enact additional legis-
lation to promote housing required for defense
workers, middle income families, aged persons and
migratory farm laborers. ‘

Veterans’ Housing

We pledge ourselves to provide special housing
aids to veterans and their families.

EDUCATION

Every American child, irrespective of color,
national origin, economic status or place of resi-
dence should have every educational opportunity
to develop his potentialities.

‘Local, State and Federal governments have
shared responsibility to contribute appropriately
to the pressing needs of our educational system.
We urge that Federal contributions be made
available to State and local units which adhere to
basic minimum standards.

The Federal Government should not dictate nor
control educational policy. .

We pledge immediate consideration for those
school systems which need further legislation to
provide Federal aid for new school construction,
teachers’ salaries and school maintenance and re-
pair. ,

We urge the adoption by appropriate legis-
lative action of the proposals advocated by the
President’s Commission on Higher Education,
including Federal scholarships.

We will continue to encourage the further de-
velopment of vocational training which helps peo-
ple acquire skills and technical knowledge so
essential to production techniques. ,

Child Welfare

The future of America depends on adequate
provision by Government for the needs of those
of our children who cannot be cared for by their
parents or private social agencies.

Maternity, Child Health and Welfare Services

The established national policy of aiding States
and localities, through the Children’s Bureau and
other agencies, to insuire needed maternity, child
health and welfare. services should be maintained

CAMPAIGN OF 1952 | 485

and extended. Especially important are the de-
tection and treatment of physical defects and
diseases which, if untreated, are reflected in adult
life in draft rejections and as handicapped work-
ers. The. Nation, as a whole, should provide
maternity and. health care for the wives, babies
and pre-school children of those who serve in our
armed forces,

School Lunches

We. will enlarge the school lunch program
which has done so much for millions of American
school children and charitable institutions while
at the same time benefiting producers.

Day Care Facilities

Since several million mothers must now be away
from their children during the day, because they
are engaged in defense work, facilities for ade-
quate day care of these children should be pro-
vided and adequately financed.

Children of Migratory Workers

The Nation, as a whole, has a responsibility to
support health, educational, and welfare services
for the children of agricultural migratory workers
who are now almost entirely without such services
while their parents are engaged in: producing
essential crops.

Veterans

The Democratic Party is determined to advance
the welfare of all the men and women who have
seen service in the armed forces. We pledge our-
selves to continue and improve our national pro-
gram of benefits for veterans and their families, to
provide the best possible medical care and hospi-
talization for the disabled veteran, and to. help
provide every veteran an opportunity to be a
productive and responsible citizen with an assured
place in the civilian community.

STRENGTHENING DemMocraATIC GOVERNMENT
Streamlining the Federal Government

The public welfare demands that our govern-
ment be efficiently and economically operated and
that it be reorganized to meet changing needs.
During the present Democratic Administration,
more reorganization has been accomplished than
by all its predecessors. We pledge our support
to continuing reorganization wherever improve-


486 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

ments can be made. Only constant effort by the
Executive, the Congress, and the public will en-
able our Government to render the splendid
service to which our citizens are entitled.

Improving the Postal Service

We pledge a continuing increase in the services
of the United States Postal Service. Through
efficient handling of mail, improved working con-
ditions for postal employees, and more frequent
services, the Democratic Party promises its efforts
to provide the greatest communication system in
the world for the American people.

Strengthening the Civil Service .

Good government requires a Civil Service high
in quality and prestige. We deplore and condemn
smear attacks upon the character and reputations
of our Federal workers. We will continue our
fight against partisan political efforts to discredit
the Federal service and undermine American
principles of justice and fair play.

Under President Truman’s leadership, the Fed-
eral Civil Service has been extended to include a
greater proportion of positions than ever before.
He has promoted a record number of career ap-
pointees to top level policy positions. We will
continue to be guided by these enlightened poli-
cies, and we will continue our efforts to provide
Federal service with adequate pay, sound retire-
ment provisions, good working conditions, and
an opportunity for advancement.

We will use every proper means to eliminate
pressure by private interests seeking undeserved
favors from the Government. We advocate the
strongest penalties against those who try to exert
improper influence, and against any who may
yield to it.

Democracy in Federal Elections

We advocate new legislation to provide effec-
tive regulation and full disclosure of campaign
expenditures in elections to Federal office, includ-
ing political advertising from any source.

We recommend that Congress provide for a
non-partisan study of possible improvements in
the methods of nominating and electing Presidents
and in the laws relating to Presidential succession.
Special attention should be given to the problem
of assuring the widest possible public participation
in Presidential nominations.

Strengthening Basic Freedoms

We will continue to press strongly for world-
wide freedom in the gathering and dissemination
of news and for support to the work of the United
Nations Commission on Human Rights in further-
ing this and other freedoms.

Equal Rights Amendment

’

We recommend and endorse for submission. to
the Congress a constitutional amendment provid-
ing equal rights for women.

Puerto Rico

Under Democratic Party leadership, a new
status has been developed for Puerto Rico. This
new status is based on mutual consent and com-
mon devotion to the United States, formalized in
a new Puerto Rican Constitution. We welcome
the dignity of the new Puerto Rican Common-
wealth and pledge our support of the Common-
wealth, its continued development and growth.

Alaska and Hawaii

By virtue of their strategic geographical loca-
tions, Alaska and Hawaii are vital bastions in the
Pacific. These two territories have contributed
greatly to the welfare and economic development
of our country and have become integrated into
our economic and social life. We, therefore, urge
immediate statehood for these two territories.

Other Territories and Possessions

We favor increased self-government for the
Virgin Islands and other outlying territories and
the trust territory of the Pacific.

District of Columbia

We favor immediate home rule and ultimate
national representation for the District of Colum-
bia.

American Indians

We shall continue to use the powers of the
Federal Government to advance the health, edu-
cation and economic well-being of our American
Indian. citizens, without impairing their cultural
traditions. We pledge our support to the cause
of fair and equitable treatment in all matters
essential to and desirable for their individual and
tribal welfare.

The American Indian should be completely inte-


grated into the social, economic and political life
of the nation. To that end we shall move to secure

the prompt final settlement of Indian claims and

to remove restrictions on the rights of Indians
individually and through their tribal councils to
handle their own fiscal affairs. .

We favor the repeal of all acts or regulations
that deny to Indians rights or privileges held by
citizens generally.

Constitutional Government

The Democratic Party has demonstrated its
belief in the Constitution as a charter of individual
freedom and an effective instrument for human
progress. Democratic Administrations have placed
upon the statute books during the last twenty
years a multitude of measures which testify to our
belief in the Jeffersonian principle of local-control,
even in general legislation involving nation-wide
programs. Selective service, Social Security, Agri-
cultural Adjustment, Low Rent Housing, Hospital,
and many other legislative programs have placed
major ‘responsibilities in States and counties and
provide fine examples of how benefits can be ex-
tended through Federal-State cooperation.

In the present world crisis with new require-
ments of Federal action for national security, and
accompanying provision for public services and
individual rights related to defense, constitutional
principles must and will be closely followed. Our
record and our clear commitments, in this plat-
form, measure our strong faith in the ability of
constitutional government to meet the needs of
our times.

Improving Congressional Procedures

In order that the will of the American people
may be expressed upon all legislative proposals,
we urge that action be taken at the beginning of
the 83rd Congress to improve Congressional pro-
cedures so that majority rule prevails and decisions
can be made after reasonable debate without
being blocked by a minority in either House.

Civil Rights.

The Democratic Party is committed to support
and advance the individual rights and liberties of
all Americans.

Our country is founded on the proposition that
all men are created equal. This means that all
citizens are equal before the law and should

CAMPAIGN OF 1952. | 487

enjoy equal political rights. They should ‘have
equal opportunities for education, for economic
advancement, and for decent living conditions.

We will continue our efforts to eradicate dis-
crimination based on race, religion or national
origin.

We know this task requires action, not just in
one section of the Nation, but in all sections. It
requires the cooperative efforts of individual citi-
zens and action by State and local governments.
It also requires Federal action.. The Federal Gov-
ernment must live up to the ideals of the Declara-

‘tion of Independence and must exercise the pow-

ers vested in it by the Constitution.

We are proud of the progress that has been
made in securing equality of treatment and oppor-
tunity in the Nation’s armed forces and the civil
service and all areas under Federal jurisdiction.
The Department of Justice has taken an important
part in successfully arguing in the courts for the
elimination of many illegal discriminations, in-
cluding those involving rights to own and use real
property, to engage in gainful occupations and
to enroll in publicly supported higher educational
institutions. We are determined that the Federal
Government shall continue such policies.

At the same time, we favor Federal legislation

effectively to secure these rights to everyone: (1) -

the right to equal opportunity for employment;
(2) the right to security of persons; (3) the right
to full and equal participation in the Nation’s
political life, free from arbitrary restraints. We
also favor legislation to perfect existing Federal
civil rights statutes and to strengthen the adminis-
trative machinery for the protection of civil rights.

CONCLUSION

Under the guidance, protection, and help of

Almighty God we shall succeed in bringing to the
people of this Nation a better and more rewarding
life and to the peoples of the entire world, new
hope and a lasting, honorable peace. ,

In recognition of this universal desire, each",62106,9643,"one boldly speaks the truth; the other spreads propaganda, fear and deception. the one de- nounces excessive taxation, bureaucratic govern- ment and corruption; the other seeks more taxes, more bureaucratic power and shields corruption. our leaders must throw off the complacent belief that the only threat to our survival is from. without. all freedoms lost since war’s end have ' been the result of internal pressures rather than external assault. to free ourselves from the greatest internal menace, we must end invisible government based upon propaganda and -éstore truly representative government based upon truth. despite failures in leadership, they have it in. their power to rise to that stature which befits their lofty heyitage of spiritual and material strength; to réject the socialist policies covertly and by devious means. being forced upon us; to | stamp out communist influence which has played so ill-famed a part in the past misdirection of our public administration;

to regain state and community auton- omy; to renounce undue alien interference in the shaping of american public policy; and to re- establish our governmental process upon a foun- dation of faith in our american institutions, american traditions, and the time-tested adequacy of american vision. many pessimistic voices are being raised today throughout the land. but the times are full of hope, if the vision and ‘courage and: faith of the early pioneer continue to animate the american people in the discharge of their sovereign responsi- bilities. the people have it in their hands to restore morality, wisdom and vision to the direction of our foreign and domestic affairs and regain the re- ligious base which in times past assured general integrity in public and private life. not for a moment do we doubt the decision or that it will guide the nation to a new and fuller greatness. in this unusual assignment we feel a deep con- sciousness of the nature and gravity of the crusade campaign of — ‘ upon which we now embatk—a crusade to which all sound and patriotic americans, irrespective of party, may well dedicate their hearts and minds and fullest effort. only thus can our beloved country restore its spiritual and temporal strength and regain once again the universal respect. democratic party platform of preamble our nation has entered into an age in which divine providence has permitted the genius of man to unlock the secret of the atom. no system of government can survive the chal- lenge of an atomic era unless its administration is committed to the stewardship of a trustee imbued with a democratic faith, a buoyant hope for the future, the charity of brotherhood, and the vision to translate these ideals into the realities of human government. the government of the united states, administered by the democratic party, is today so entrusted. the free choice of the democratic party by the people of america as the. instrument to achieve that purpose will mean world peace with honor, national security based on collective pacts with other free nations, and a high level of human dignity. national survival demands that these goals be attained, and the endowments of the democratic party alone can assure their attain- ment. for twenty years, under the dedicated guidance | of franklin delano roosevelt and harry s. tru- man, our country has moved steadily along the road which has led the united states of america to world leadership in the cause of freedom. we will not retreat one inch along that road. rather, it is our prayerful hope that the people, whom we have so faithfully served, will renew the mandate to continue our service and that al- mighty god may grant us the wisdom to succeed. twenty years of progress achieving prosperity an objective appraisal of the past record clearly demonstrates that the democratic party has been the chosen american instrument to achieve pros- perity, build a stronger democracy, erect the struc- ture of world peace, and continue on the path of progress. national party platforms democratic party policies and programs rescued american business from total collapse—from the fatal economic. consequences of watered stock, unsound banks, useless and greedy holding com- panies, high tariff barriers, and predatory business practices, all of which prevailed under the last - republican administrations. democratic policies have enabled the federal government to help all business, small and large, to achieve the highest rate of productivity, the widest domestic and world markets, and the largest profits in the his- tory of the nation. the simple fact is that today theré are more than four million operating business enterprises in this country, over one million more than existed in . corporate losses in that fateful year were over three billion dollars; in , corporate profits, after taxes, reached the staggering total of eighteen billion. democratic policies and programs rescued american agriculture from the economic conse- quences of blight, drought, flood and storm, from oppressive and indiscriminate foreclosures, and from the ruinous conditions brought about by the bungling incompetence and neglect of the pre- ceding twelve years of republican maladministra- tion. economic stability, soil conservation, rural electrification, farm dwelling improvement, in- creased production and efficiency and more than sevenfold ‘increase in cash income have been the return to farmers for their faith in the democratic party. democratic labor policies have rescued the wage earners in this country from mass unem- ployment and from sweatshop slavery at starvation wages. under our democratic administrations, decent hours, decent wages, and decent working conditions have become the rule rather than the exception. self organizations of labor unions and collective bargaining, both of which are the keystone to labor management, peace and prosperity, must be encouraged, for the good of all. ; unemployment is now less than per cent of the labor force, compared with almost per cent in . trade union membership has reached a total of million, which is more than five times the total of . the welfare of all economic and social groups in our society has been promoted by the sound, progressive and humane policies of the demo- cratic party. ‘strengthening democracy we are convinced that lasting prosperity must _ be founded upon a healthy democratic society respectful of the rights of all people. under democratic party leadership more has been done in the past twenty years to enhance the sanctity of individual rights than ever before in our history. racial and religious minorities have progressed further toward real equality than dur- ing the preceding years. governmental services, democratically admin- istered, have been improved and extended. the efficiency, economy, and integration of federal operations have been advocated and effectuated through sound programs and policies. through cooperative programs of federal aid, state and local governments have been encouraged and en- abled to provide many more services. the democratic party has been alert to the corroding and demoralizing effects of dishonesty and disloyalty in the public service. it has ex- posed and punished those who would corrupt the integrity of the public service, and it has always championed honesty and morality in gov- ernment. the loyalty program of president tru- man has served effectively to prevent infiltration by subversive elements and to protect honest and loyal’ public servants against unfounded and malicious attacks. we commend the relentless and fearless actions of congressional committees which, under vigor- ous democratic leadership, have exposed derelic- tion in public service, and we pledge our support to a continuance of such actions as conditions re- quire them. the administration of our government by the democratic party has been based upon principles of justice and equity, and upon the american tradition of fair play. men who are elected to high political office are entrusted with high re- sponsibilities. slander, defamation of character, deception and dishonesty are as truly transgres- sions of god’s commandments, when resorted to by men in public life, as they are for all other men. building peace with honor the democratic party has worked constantly for peace—lasting peace, peace with honor, free- ‘dom, justice and security for all nations. the return of the democratic party to power in marked the end of a tragic era of isolation- ism fostered by republican administrations which - had deliberately and callously rejected the golden opportunity created by woodrow wilson for col- lective action to secure the peace. this folly contributed to the second world war. victory in that war has presented the nations of the world a new opportunity which the demo- cratic party is determined shall not be lost. - we have helped establish the instrumentalities through which the hope of mankind for universal world peace can be realized. under democratic leadership, our nation has moved promptly and effectively to meet and repel the menace to world peace by soviet imperialism. progress in the new era the democratic party believes that past prog- ress is but a prelude to the human aspirations which may be realized in the future. under democratic party leadership, america has accepted each new challenge of history and has found practical solutions to meet and over- come them. this we have done without departing from the principles of our basic philosophy, that is, the destiny of man to achieve his earthly ends ‘in the spirit of brotherhood. a great democrat—franklin delano roosevelt —devised the programs of the new deal to meet the pressing problems of the 1930s. another great democrat—harry s. truman—devised the pro- grams of the fair deal to meet the complex prob- lems of america in the 1940s. the democratic party is ready to face and solve the challenging problems of the 1950s, we dedicate ourselves to the: magnificent work of these great presi- dents and to mould and adapt their democratic principles to the new problems of the years ahead. ' in this spirit we adopt and pledge ourselves to this, the democratic platform for : our goat is peace witrh honor peace with honor is the greatest of all our goals. we pledge our unremitting efforts to avert an- other world war. we are determined that the people shall be spared that frightful agony. we are convinced that peace and security can be safeguarded if america does not deviate from the practical and successful policies developed under democratic leadership since the close of world war ii. we will resolutely move ahead with the constructive task of promoting peace. campaign of the democrratic program for peace and national security , supporting the united nations under democratic leadership, this country sponsored and helped create the united nations and became a charter member and _ staunchly supports its aims. we will continue our efforts to strengthen the united nations, improve its institutions as ex- perience requires, and foster its growth and de- velopment. . , the communist aggressor has been hurled back from south korea. thus, korea has proved, once and for all, that the united nations will resist aggression. we urge continued effort, by every honorable means, to bring about a fair and effec- tive peace settlement in korea in accordance with the principles of the united nations’ charter. strong national defense our nation has strengthened its national de- fenses against the menace of soviet aggression. the democratic party will continue to stand unequivocally for the strong, balanced defense forces for this country—land, sea and air. we will continue to support the expansion and mainte- nance of the military and civil defense forces re- quired for our national security. we reject the defeatist view of those who say we cannot afford the expense and effort necessary to defend our- selves. we express our full confidence in the joint chiefs of staff. we voice complete faith in the ability and valor of our armed forces, and pride in their accomplishments. collective strength for the free worlpd we reject the ridiculous notions of those who would have the united states face the aggressors alone. that would be the most expensive—and the most dangerous—method of seeking security. this nation needs strong allies, around the world, making their maximum contribution to the com- mon defense. they add their strength to ours in the defense of freedom. the truman doctrine in , the organization of hemisphere defense at rio de janeiro that same year, the marshall plan in , the north at- lantic treaty in , the point iv program, the resistance to communist aggression in korea, the pacific security pacts in , and the mutual security programs now under way—all stand as national party platforms landmarks of america’s progress in mobilizing the strength of the free world to keep the peace. encouraging european unity we encourage the economic and political unity of free europe and the increasing solidarity of the nations of the north atlantic community. we hail the schuman plan to pool the basic resources of industrial. western europe, and the european defense community. we are proud of america’s part in carrying these great projects forward, and we pledge our continuing support until they are established. , support for free germany we welcome the german federal republic into the company of free nations. we are deter- mined that germany shall remain free and con- tinue as a good neighbor in the european com- munity. we sympathize with the german people’s - wish for unity and will continue to do everything we can by peaceful means to overcome the krem- lin’s obstruction of that rightful aim. support for the victims of soviet imperialism we will not abandon the once-free peoples of - central and eastern europe who suffer now under the kremlin’s tyranny in violation of the soviet union’s most solemn pledges at tehran, yalta, and potsdam. the united states should join other nations in formally declaring gendcide to be an international crime in time of peace as well as war. this crime was exposed once more by the shocking revelations of soviet guilt as disclosed in the report filed in congress by the special com- mittee investigating the katyn forest massacre. we look forward to the day when the liberties of poland and the other oppressed soviet satellites, including czechoslovakia, hungary, rumania, bulgaria, albania, lithuania, estonia and latvia and other nations in asia under soviet domi- nation, will be restored to them and they can again take their rightful place in. the community of free nations. we will carry forward and ex- pand the vital and effective program of the “voice of america” for penetration of the “iron curtain,” bringing truth and hope to all the people subju- gated by the soviet empire. support for the nations of the middle east we seek to enlist the people of the middle east to work with us and with each other in the de- velopment of the region, the lifting of health and living standards, and the attainment of peace. we favor the development of integrated security ar- rangements for the middle east and other assist- ance to help safeguard the independence of the countries in the area. we pledge continued assistance to israel. so that she may fulfill her humanitarian mission of providing shelter and sanctuary for her homeless jewish refugees while strengthening her economic development. we will continue to support the tripartite decla- ration of may , to encourage israel and the arab states to settle their differences by direct negotiation, to maintain and protect the sanctity of the holy places and to permit free access to them. we pledge aid to the arab states to enable them to develop their economic resources and raise the living standards of their people. we support. measures for the relief and reintegration of the palestine refugees, and we pledge continued assistance to the reintegration program voted by the general assembly of the united nations in january . south asia: a testing ground for democracy in the subcontinent of south asia, we pledge continuing support for the great new countries of india and pakistan in their efforts to create a bet- ter life for their people and build strong demo- cratic governments to stand as bastions of liberty in asia, secure against the threat of communist subversion. collective security in the pacific we welcome free japan as a friendly neighbor and an ally in seeking security and progress for the whole pacific area. america’s security pacts with japan and with the philippines, australia, and new zealand are indispenseble steps toward comprehensive mutual security arrangements in that area. our military and economic assistance to the nationalist government of china on for- mosa has strengthened that vital outpost of the free world, and will be continued. strengthening the americas in the western hemisphere, we pledge our- selves to continue the policy of the good neighbor. we will strive constantly to strengthen the bonds of friendship and coeperation with our latin american allies who are joined with us in the defense of the americas. disarmament remains the goal the free world is rearming to secure the peace. under democratic leadership, america always stands prepared to join in a workable system for foolproof inspection and limitation of all arma- ments, including atomic weapons. this nation has taken the leadership in proposing concrete, practical plans for such a system. we are de- termined to carry on the effort for real, effective disarmament. we look forward to the day when a great share of the resources now devoted to the armaments program can be diverted: into the channels of peaceful production to speed the progress of america and of the underdeveloped regions of the world. helping other people to help themselves even though we cannot now disarm, we will go forward as rapidly as possible in developing the imaginative and farsighted concept of president truman embodied in the point iv program. we will continue to encourage use of american skills and capital in helping the people of under- developed lands to combat disease, raise living standards, improve land tenure and develop in- dustry and trade. the continuance of ever stronger and more vigorous point iv programs— sponsored both by this country and by the united nations—is an indispensable element in creating a peaceful world. upholding the principle of self-determination . in an era when the “satellite state” symbolizes both the tyranny of the aggressor nations and the extinction of liberty in small nations, the democratic party reasserts and reaffirms the wil- sonian principle of the right of national self- determination. it is part of the policy of the democratic party, therefore, to encourage and assist small nations and all peoples in the peaceful and orderly achievement of their legitimate aspi- rations toward political, geographical and ethnic integrity so that they may dwell in the family of sovereign nations with freedom and dignity. expanding world trade the democratic party has always stood for expanding trade among free nations. we reassert campaign of that stand today. we vigorously oppose any restrictive policies which would weaken the highly successful reciprocal trade program fathered by cordell hull. since , the united states has taken the lead in fostering the expansion and liberalization of world trade. our own economy requires expanded export markets for our manufactured and agricultural products and ‘a greater supply of essential im- ported raw materials. at the same time, our friends throughout the world will have oppor- tunity to earn their own way to higher living standards with lessened dependence on our aid. progressive immigration policies ‘ solution of the problem of refugees from com- munism and over-population has become a per- manent part of the foreign policy program of the democratic party. we pledge continued coopera- tion with other free nations to solve it. we pledge continued aid to refugees from com- munism and the enactment of president truman’s proposals for legislation in this field. in this way we can give hope and courage to the victims of soviet brutality and can carry on the humanitarian tradition of the displaced persons act. subversive elements must be screened out and prevented from entering our land, but the gates must be left open for practical numbers of desira- ble persons from abroad whose immigration to this country provides an invigorating infusion into- the stream of american life; as well as a significant contribution to the solution of the world refugee and over-population problems. we pledge continuing revision of our. immi- gration and naturalization laws to do away with any unjust and unfair practices against national groups which have contributed some of our best citizens. we will eliminate distinctions between nativeborn and naturalized citizens. we want no “second-class” citizens in free america. our domestic policy economic opportunity and growth the united states is today a land of boundless opportunity. never before has it offered such a large measure of prosperity, security and hope for all its people. horizons of even greater abundance and oppor- tunity lie before us under a democratic adminis- . tration responsive to the will of the people. national party platforms the democratic administration has had a guiding principle since taking office years ago: that the prosperity and growth of this nation are indivisible. every step we have taken to help the farmers has also helped the workers and business. every improvement in the status of the worker has helped both farmers and business. every ex- pansion of business has provided more jobs for workers and greater demand for farm products. ‘a stabilized economy combatting inflation the democratic administration early recog- nized that defense production would limit the amount of goods in civilian markets, and subject our economy to heavy inflationary pressure. to prevent this from resulting in ruinous inflation, the administration proposed pay-as-we-go taxation to keep the national debt as low as possible and to prevent excess money pressure on scarce goods and services. direct controls were also proposed to channel scarce materials into highly essential defense pro- duction, and to keep prices down. in and republican congressmen demonstrated their attitude toward these neces- sary measures when they sponsored amendments which would have destroyed all controls. prices we shall strive to redress the injury done to the american people—especially to white collar workers and fixed-income families—by the weak- ening amendments which the republicans in congress have forced into our anti-inflation laws. we pledge continuance of workable controls so long as the emergency requires them. we pledge fair and impartial enforcement of controls and their removal as quickly as economic conditions allow. rents we strongly urge continued federal rent control in critical defense areas and in the many other localities still suffering from a substantial shortage of adequate housing at reasonable prices. full employment the democratic administration prudently passed the employment act of declaring it . to be national policy never again to permit large- scale unemployment to stalk the land. we will assure the transition from defense production to peace-time production without the ravages of un- employment. we pledge ourselves at all times to the maintenance of maximum employment, pro- duction, and purchasing power in the american economy. integrity in government finances we solemnly pledge the preservation ‘of the financial strength of the government. we have demonstrated our ability to maintain and enhance the nation’s financial strength. in the six full fiscal years since v-j day, our fiscal policy has produced a $ billion budget surplus. we have reduced the public debt $ billion from the postwar peak, we have demonstrated our ability to make fiscal policy contribute in a positive way to eco- nomic growth and the maintenance of high-level employment. the policies which have been fol- — lowed have given us the greatest prosperity in our history. sustained. economic expansion has pro- vided the funds necessary to finance our defense and has still left our people with record high consumer incomes and business with a record volume of investment. employment and personal incomes are at record levels. never have ameéri- cans enjoyed a higher standard of living and saved more for contingencies and old age. federal taxes we believe in fair and equitable taxation. we oppose a federal general sales tax. we adhere to the principle of ability to pay. we have enacted an emergency excess profits tax to prevent profit- eering from the defense program and have vigor- ously attacked special tax privileges. tax reductions in the future, as in the past, we will hold firm to policies consistent with sound financing and continuing economic progress. as rapidly as de- fense requirements permit, we favor’ reducing taxes, especially for people with lower incomes. but we will not imperil our nation’s security by making reckless promises to reduce taxes. we deplore irresponsible assertions that national se- curity can be achieved without paying for it. closing tax loopholes justice requires the elimination of tax loopholes which favor special groups. we pledge continued efforts to the elimination of remaining loopholes. government expenditures we believe in keeping government expenditures to the lowest practicable level. the great bulk of ‘our’ national budget consists of obligations in- curred for defense purposes. we pledge ourselves _ to a vigilant review of our expenditures in order to reduce them as much as possible. the american farmer and agriculture we know that national prosperity depends upon a vigorous, productive and expanding agriculture. we take great pride in our party’s record of performance and ‘in the impressive gains made by american agriculture in the last two decades. under programs of democratic administrations the net agricultural income has increased from less than two billion dollars to almost fifteen bil- lion dollars. these programs must be continued and improved. resource conservation the. soil resources of our country have been conserved and strengthened through the soil con- servation service, the agricultural. conservation program, the forestry and the research programs, with their incentives to increased production through sound conservation farming. these pro- grams have revolutionized american agriculture and must be continued and expanded. we will accelerate programs of upstream flood prevention, ‘watershed protection, and soil, forest and water conservation in all parts of the country. these conservation measures are a national necessity; they are invaluable to our farmers, and add greatly to the welfare of all americans and of generations yet unborn. grass roots administration we will continue the widest possible farmer participation through referenda, farmer-elected committees, local soil conservation districts, and self-governing agencies in the conduct and ad- ministration of these truly democratic programs, initiated and developed under democratic ad- minstrations. price supports under the present farm program, our farmers campaign of. have performed magnificently and have achieved unprecedented production. we applaud the re- cent congressional action in setting aside the “sliding scale” for price support through , and we will continue to protect the producers of basic agricultural commodities under the terms of a mandatory price support program at not less than ninety percent of parity. we continue to advocate ‘practical methods for extending price supports to other storables and to the-producers of perishable commodities, which account for three-fourths of all farm income. abundant production we will continue to assist farmers in providing abundant and stable supplies of agricultural com- modities for the consumers at reasonable ‘prices, and in assuring the farmer the opportunity to earn a fair return commensurate with that enjoyed by other segments of the american economy. the agricultural adjustment programs encour- age the production of abundant supplies while enabling producers to keep supply in line with consumer demand, preventing wide fluctuations and bringing stability to the agricultural income of the nation. we pledge retention of such pro- grams. we pledge continued efforts to provide ade- quate storage facilities for grain and other farm products with sufficient capacity for needed re- serves for defense, and other emergency require- ments, in order to. protect the integrity of the farm price support programs. research we are justly proud of the outstanding achieve- ments of our agricultural research, we favor a greatly expanded research and education program for american agriculture in order that both pro- duction and distribution may more effectively serve consumers and producers alike, and thus meet the needs of the modern world. we favor especial emphasis on the development of new crops and varieties, on crop and livestock disease and pest control, and on agricultural statistics and marketing services. marketing we must find profitable markets for the prod- ucts of our farms, and we should produce all that these ‘markets will absorb. to this end we will national party platforms continue our efforts to reduce trade barriers, both at home and abroad, to provide better marketing and inspection facilities, and to find new uses and outlets for our foods and fibers both in domestic and foreign markets. farm credit we have provided credit facilities for all agri- . culture, including means by which young men, veterans of military service, and farm tenants have been encouraged to become farmers and farm home-owners, and through which low-income farmers have been assisted in establishing self- sustaining and fully productive farm units. we will not waver in our efforts to provide such incentives. crop insurance crop insurance to protect farmers against loss from destruction of their crops by natural causes has been created and developed under demo- cratic administrations into a sound business opera- tion. this program should be expanded as rapidly as experience justifies, in order that its benefits may be made available to every farmer. rural electrification democratic administrations have established the great rural electrification program, which has brought light and power to the rural homes of our nation. in , only % of the farm homes of america had the benefits of electricity. today % of our rural homes enjoy the benefits of electric light and power. we will continue to fight to make electricity available to all rural homes, with adequate facilities for the generation and transmission of power. through the rural telephone program, inaugurated by the demo- cratic 81st congress, we will provide the op- portunity for every farm home to have this modern essential service. we pledge support of these self- liquidating farm programs. cooperatives we wil! continue to support the sound develop- ment and growth of bona fide farm cooperatives and to protect them from punitive taxation. defense needs we will continue to recognize agriculture as an essential defense industry, and to assist in pro- viding all the necessary tools, machinery, fertilizer, and manpower needed by farmers in meeting pro- duction goals. family farming the family farm is the keystone of american agriculture. we will strive unceasingly to make the farm homes of our country healthier and hap- pier places in which to live. we must see that our youth continues to find attractive opportunity in the field of agriculture. ~ the republican party platform is loud in its criticism of our great farm programs. we chal- lenge republicans and other enemies of farm progress to justify their opposition to the program now in operation, to oppose the improvements here proposed, or to advocate repeal of a single vital part of our program. a fam deal for workers good incomes there can be-no national prosperity unless our working men and women continue to prosper and enjoy rising living standards. the rising produc- tivity of american workers is a key to our un- paralleled industrial progress. good incomes for our workers are the secret of our great and grow- ing consumer markets. labor-management relations good labor-management relations are essential to good incomes for wage earners and rising out- put from our factories. we believe that to the widest possible extent consistent with the public interest, management and labor should determine wage rates and conditions of employment throug free collective bargaining. taft-hartley act we strongly advocate the repeal of the taft- hartley act. the taft-hartley act has been proved to be inadequate, unworkable, and unfair. it interferes in an arbitrary manner with collective bargaining, tipping the scales in favor of management against. labor. the taft-hartley act has revived the injunction as a weapon against labor in industrial relations. the act has arbitrarily forbidden traditional hiring practices which are desired by both management and labor in many industries. the act has forced workers to act as strikebreakers against their fellow unionists. the act has served to interfere with one of the most. fundamental rights of american workers—the right to organize in unions of their own choosing. we deplore the fact that the taft-hartley act provides an inadequate and unfair means of meet- ing with national emergency situations. we advo- cate legislation that will enable the president to deal fairly and effectively with cases where a breakdown: in collective bargaining seriously threatens the national safety or welfare. in keeping with the. progress of the times, and based on past experiences, a new legislative ap- proach toward the entire labor management prob- lem should be explored. . fair labor standards we pledge to continue our efforts so that gov- ernment programs designed to establish improved fair labor standards shall prove a means of. assur- ing minimum wages, hours and protection to workers, consistent with present-day progress. equal pay for equal work we believe in equal pay for equal work, regard- less of sex, and we urge legislation to make that principle effective. the physically-handicapped we promise to further the program to afford employment opportunities both in government and in private industry for physically handicapped persons. migratory workers we advocate prompt improvement of employ- ment. conditions of migratory workers and in- creased protection of their safety and health. strengthening free enterprise the free enterprise system has flourished and prospered in america during these last twenty years as never before. this has been made pos- sible by the purchasing power of all our people and we are determined that the broad base of our prosperity. shall be maintained. campaign of small and independent business small and independent business is the backbone of amcrican free enterprise. upon its health de- pends the growth of the economic system whose competitive spirit has built this nation’s industrial strength and provided its workers and consumers with an incomparably high standard of living. independent business is the best offset to monopoly practices. the government’s role is to insure that independent business receives equally fair treatment with its competitors. congress has established the permanent small business committee of the senate and the special small business committee of the house, which have continued to render great service to this im- portant segment of. our economy. we favor con- tinuance of both these committees with all the powers to investigate and report conditions, cor- rect discriminations, and propose needed. legis- lation. we pledge ourselvés to increased efforts to assure that small business be given equal oppor- tunity. to participate in government contracts, and that a suitable proportion of the dollar volume of defense contracts be channeled into independent small business. the small defense plants ad- ministration, which our party caused to be estab- lished, should retain its independent status and be made a continuing: agency, equipped with sufficient lending powers to assist qualified small business in securing defense contracts. . we urge the enactrnent of such laws as will provide favorable incentives to the establishment and survival of independent businesses, especially in the provision of tax incentives and access to equity or risk capital. enforcement of anti-trust laws free competitive enterprise must remain free and competitive if the productive forces of. this nation are to remain strong. we are alarmed over the increasing concentration of economic power in the hands of a few. we reaffirm our belief in the necessity of vigor- ous. enforcement of the laws against trusts, com- binations, and restraints of trade, which laws are vital to the safeguarding of the public interest and of small competitive business men against preda- tory monopolies. we will seek adequate appro- national party platforms priations for the department of justice and the federal trade commission for vigorous investi- gation and for enforcement of the anti-trust laws. we support the right of all persons to work to- gether in cooperatives and other democratic asso- ciations for the purpose of carrying out any proper business operations free from any arbitrary and. discriminatory restrictions. protection of investors and consumers we must avoid unnecessary business controls. but we cannot close our eyes to the special prob- lems which require government surveillance. the government must continue its efforts to stop un- fair selling practices which deceive investors, and unfair trade practices which deceive consumers. transportation in the furtherance of national defense and commerce, we pledge continued government sup- port, on a sound financial basis, for further de- velopment of the nation’s transportation systems, land, sea and air. we endorse a policy of fostering the safest and most reliable air transportation system of the world. we favor fair, nondiscrimina- tory freight rates to encourage economic growth in all parts of the country. highways in cooperation with state and local govern- mental units, we will continue to plan, coordinate, finance, and encourage the expansion of our road and highway network, including access roads, for the dual purposes of national defense and efficient motor transportation. we support expansion of farm-to-market roads. rivers and harbors we pledge continued development of our -har- bors and waterways. merchant marine we will continue to: encourage and support an adequate merchant marine. . our natura resources the united states has been blessed with the richest natural resources of any nation on earth. yet, unless we redouble our conservation efforts we will become a “have-not” nation in some of the most important raw materials upon which depend our industries, agriculture, employment and high standard of living. this can be prevented by a well rounded and nation-wide conservation effort. land and water resources we favor sound, progressive development of the nation’s land and water resources for flood control, navigation, irrigation, power, drain- age, soil conservation and creation of new, small family-sized farms, with immediate action in criti- cal areas. we favor the acceleration of all such projects, including construction of transmission facilities to load centers for wider and more equitable distri- bution of electric energy at the lowest cost to the consumer with continuing preference to public agencies and rea cooperatives. the democratic party denounces all obstruc- tionist devices designed to prevent or retard utili- zation of the nation’s power and water resources for the benefit of the people, their enterprises and interests. the wise policy of the democratic party in en- couraging multipurpose projects throughout the country is responsible for america’s productive superiority over any nation in the world and is one of the greatest single factors leading toward the accomplishment of world peace. without these projects our atomic weapons program could never have been achieved, and without additional such projects it cannot be expanded. the democratic party is dedicated to a continu- ation of the natural resources development policy inaugurated and carried out under the administra- tions of presidents roosevelt and truman, and to the extension of that policy to all parts of the nation—north, south, east, midwest, west and the territories to the end that the nation and its people receive maximum benefits from these re- sources to which they have an inherent right. the democratic party further pledges itself to protect these resources from destructive monopoly and exploitation. river basin development we pledge the continued full and unified re- gional development of the water, mineral and other natural resources of the nation, recognizing that the progress already achieved under the initiative of the democratic party in the arid and semi-arid states of the west, as well as in the tennessee valley, is only an indication: of still greater results which can: be accomplished. fertilizer development great. farming areas, particularly of the mid- west and west, are in acute need of low-cost commercial fertilizers. to meet this demand, we favor the opening of the nation’s phosphate rock deposits in the west, through prompt provision of sufficient low-cost hydro-electric power to de- velop this great resource. forests and public lands we seek to establish and demonstrate such suc- cessful policies of forest and land management on ‘federal property as will materially assist state and private owners in their conservation efforts. con- servation of forest and range lands is vital to the strength and welfare of the nation. our forest and range lands must be protected and used wisely in order to produce a continuing supply of basic raw materials for industry; to reduce damaging floods; and to preserve the sources of priceless water. with adequate appropriations to carry out feasible projects, we pledge a program of forest protection, reforestation projects and sound practices of production and_ harvesting - which will promote sustained yields of forest crops. we propose to increase forest access roads in order to improve cutting practices on both public and private lands. on the public land ranges we pledge continu- ance of effective conservation and use programs, including the extension of water pond construc- tion and restoration of forage cover. arid areas in many areas of the nation assistance is needed to provide water for irrigation, domestic and industrial purposes. we pledge that in work- _ ing out programs for rational distribution of water from federal sources we will aid in delivering this essential of life cheaply and abundantly. minerals and fuels the nation’s minerals and fuels are essential to the national defense and development of our country. we pledge the adoption of policies which will further encourage the exploration and de- velopment of additional reserves of our mineral campaign of resources. we subscribe to the principles of the stockpiling act and will lend our efforts to strengthening and expanding its provisions and those of the defense production act to meet our military and civilian needs. additional access roads should be constructed with government aid. our synthetic fuels, including monetary metals, research program should go forward. laws to aid and assist these objectives will be advocated. domestic fisheries we favor increased research and exploration for conserving and better utilizing fishery re- sources; expanded research and education to pro- mote new fishery products and uses and new markets; promotion of world trade in fish products; a public works and water policy providing ade- quate protection for domestic fishery resources; and treaties with other nations for. conservation and better utilization of international fisheries. wildlife recreations in our highly complex civilization, outdoor rec- reation has become essential to the health and happiness of our people. the democratic party has devoted its efforts to the preservation, restoration and increase of the bird, animal and fish life which abound in this nation. state, local and private agencies have cooperated in this worthy endeavor. we have ex- tended and vastly improved the parks, forests, beaches, streams, preserves and wilderness areas across the land. to the ,, of our citizens who annually purchase fishing and hunting licenses, we pledge continued efforts to improve all recreational areas. atomic energy in the field of atomic energy, we pledge our- selves: () to maintain vigorous and non-partisan civilian administrations, with adequate security safeguards; () to promote the development. of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the interests of america and mankind; () to build all the atomic and hydrogen fire- power needed to defend our country, deter ag- “gression, and promote world peace; () to exert every effort to bring about bona national party platforms fide international control and inspection of all atomic weapons. socital security our national system of social security, con- ceived and developed by the democratic party, needs to be extended and improved. old age and survivors insurance we favor further strengthening of old age and survivors insurance, through such improvements as increasing benefits, extending them to more people and’ lowering the retirement age for women. we favor the complete elimination of the work clause for the reason that those contributing to the social security program should be permitted to draw benefits, upon reaching the age of eligi- bility, and still continue to work. unemployment insurance we favor a stronger system of unemployment insurance, with broader coverage and substantially increased benefits, including an allowance for de- pendents. public assistance we favor further improvements in public assist- ance programs for the blind, the disabled, the aged and children in order to help our less for- tunate citizens meet the needs of daily living. private plans we favor and encourage the private endeavors of social agencies, mutual associations, insurance companies, industry-labor groups, and cooperative societies to provide against the. basic hazards of life through mutually agreed upon benefit plans designed to complement our present social security program. needs of our aging citizens our older citizens constitute an immense reser- voir of skilled, mature judgment and ripened ex- perience. we pledge ourselves to give full recog- ‘nition to the right of our older citizens to lead a proud, productive and independent life through- out their years. in addition to the fundamental improvements in old age and survivors insurance, which are outlined above, we pledge ourselves, in coopera- tion with the states and private industry, to en- courage the employment of older workers. we commend the 82nd congress for eliminating the age restriction on employment in the federal gov- ernment. health we will continue to work for better health for every american, especially our children. we pledge continued and wholehearted support for the campaign that modern medicine is waging against mental illness, cancer, heart disease and other diseases. ‘ research we favor continued and vigorous support, from private and public sources, of research into the causes, prevention and cure of disease. medical education we advocate federal aid for medical education to help overcome the growing shortages of doctors, nurses, and other trained health personnel. hospitals and health centers we pledge continued support for federal aid to hospital construction. we pledge increased federal aid to promote public health through preventive programs and health services, espe- cially in rural areas. cost of m. edical care we also advocate a resolute attack on the heavy financial hazard of serious illness. we recognize that the costs of modern medical care have grown to be prohibitive for many millions of people. we commend president truman for establishing the non-partisan commission on the health needs of the nation to seek an acceptable solution of this urgent problem. housing we pledge ourselves to the- fulfillment of the programs of private housing, public low-rent housing, slum clearance, urban redevelopment, farm housing and housing research as authorized by the housing act of . we deplore the efforts of special interests groups, which themselves have prospered through government guarantees of housing mortgages, to destroy those programs adopted to assist families of low-income. additional legislation we pledge ourselves to enact additional legis- lation to promote housing required for defense workers, middle income families, aged persons and migratory farm laborers. ‘ veterans’ housing we pledge ourselves to provide special housing aids to veterans and their families. education every american child, irrespective of color, national origin, economic status or place of resi- dence should have every educational opportunity to develop his potentialities. ‘local, state and federal governments have shared responsibility to contribute appropriately to the pressing needs of our educational system. we urge that federal contributions be made available to state and local units which adhere to basic minimum standards. the federal government should not dictate nor control educational policy. . we pledge immediate consideration for those school systems which need further legislation to provide federal aid for new school construction, teachers’ salaries and school maintenance and re- pair. , we urge the adoption by appropriate legis- lative action of the proposals advocated by the president’s commission on higher education, including federal scholarships. we will continue to encourage the further de- velopment of vocational training which helps peo- ple acquire skills and technical knowledge so essential to production techniques. , child welfare the future of america depends on adequate provision by government for the needs of those of our children who cannot be cared for by their parents or private social agencies. maternity, child health and welfare services the established national policy of aiding states and localities, through the children’s bureau and other agencies, to insuire needed maternity, child health and welfare. services should be maintained campaign of | and extended. especially important are the de- tection and treatment of physical defects and diseases which, if untreated, are reflected in adult life in draft rejections and as handicapped work- ers. the. nation, as a whole, should provide maternity and. health care for the wives, babies and pre-school children of those who serve in our armed forces, school lunches we. will enlarge the school lunch program which has done so much for millions of american school children and charitable institutions while at the same time benefiting producers. day care facilities since several million mothers must now be away from their children during the day, because they are engaged in defense work, facilities for ade- quate day care of these children should be pro- vided and adequately financed. children of migratory workers the nation, as a whole, has a responsibility to support health, educational, and welfare services for the children of agricultural migratory workers who are now almost entirely without such services while their parents are engaged in: producing essential crops. veterans the democratic party is determined to advance the welfare of all the men and women who have seen service in the armed forces. we pledge our- selves to continue and improve our national pro- gram of benefits for veterans and their families, to provide the best possible medical care and hospi- talization for the disabled veteran, and to. help provide every veteran an opportunity to be a productive and responsible citizen with an assured place in the civilian community. strengthening demmocraatic government streamlining the federal government the public welfare demands that our govern- ment be efficiently and economically operated and that it be reorganized to meet changing needs. during the present democratic administration, more reorganization has been accomplished than by all its predecessors. we pledge our support to continuing reorganization wherever improve- national party platforms ments can be made. only constant effort by the executive, the congress, and the public will en- able our government to render the splendid service to which our citizens are entitled. improving the postal service we pledge a continuing increase in the services of the united states postal service. through efficient handling of mail, improved working con- ditions for postal employees, and more frequent services, the democratic party promises its efforts to provide the greatest communication system in the world for the american people. strengthening the civil service . good government requires a civil service high in quality and prestige. we deplore and condemn smear attacks upon the character and reputations of our federal workers. we will continue our fight against partisan political efforts to discredit the federal service and undermine american principles of justice and fair play. under president truman’s leadership, the fed- eral civil service has been extended to include a greater proportion of positions than ever before. he has promoted a record number of career ap- pointees to top level policy positions. we will continue to be guided by these enlightened poli- cies, and we will continue our efforts to provide federal service with adequate pay, sound retire- ment provisions, good working conditions, and an opportunity for advancement. we will use every proper means to eliminate pressure by private interests seeking undeserved favors from the government. we advocate the strongest penalties against those who try to exert improper influence, and against any who may yield to it. democracy in federal elections we advocate new legislation to provide effec- tive regulation and full disclosure of campaign expenditures in elections to federal office, includ- ing political advertising from any source. we recommend that congress provide for a non-partisan study of possible improvements in the methods of nominating and electing presidents and in the laws relating to presidential succession. special attention should be given to the problem of assuring the widest possible public participation in presidential nominations. strengthening basic freedoms we will continue to press strongly for world- wide freedom in the gathering and dissemination of news and for support to the work of the united nations commission on human rights in further- ing this and other freedoms. equal rights amendment ’ we recommend and endorse for submission. to the congress a constitutional amendment provid- ing equal rights for women. puerto rico under democratic party leadership, a new status has been developed for puerto rico. this new status is based on mutual consent and com- mon devotion to the united states, formalized in a new puerto rican constitution. we welcome the dignity of the new puerto rican common- wealth and pledge our support of the common- wealth, its continued development and growth. alaska and hawaii by virtue of their strategic geographical loca- tions, alaska and hawaii are vital bastions in the pacific. these two territories have contributed greatly to the welfare and economic development of our country and have become integrated into our economic and social life. we, therefore, urge immediate statehood for these two territories. other territories and possessions we favor increased self-government for the virgin islands and other outlying territories and the trust territory of the pacific. district of columbia we favor immediate home rule and ultimate national representation for the district of colum- bia. american indians we shall continue to use the powers of the federal government to advance the health, edu- cation and economic well-being of our american indian. citizens, without impairing their cultural traditions. we pledge our support to the cause of fair and equitable treatment in all matters essential to and desirable for their individual and tribal welfare. the american indian should be completely inte- grated into the social, economic and political life of the nation. to that end we shall move to secure the prompt final settlement of indian claims and to remove restrictions on the rights of indians individually and through their tribal councils to handle their own fiscal affairs. . we favor the repeal of all acts or regulations that deny to indians rights or privileges held by citizens generally. constitutional government the democratic party has demonstrated its belief in the constitution as a charter of individual freedom and an effective instrument for human progress. democratic administrations have placed upon the statute books during the last twenty years a multitude of measures which testify to our belief in the jeffersonian principle of local-control, even in general legislation involving nation-wide programs. selective service, social security, agri- cultural adjustment, low rent housing, hospital, and many other legislative programs have placed major ‘responsibilities in states and counties and provide fine examples of how benefits can be ex- tended through federal-state cooperation. in the present world crisis with new require- ments of federal action for national security, and accompanying provision for public services and individual rights related to defense, constitutional principles must and will be closely followed. our record and our clear commitments, in this plat- form, measure our strong faith in the ability of constitutional government to meet the needs of our times. improving congressional procedures in order that the will of the american people may be expressed upon all legislative proposals, we urge that action be taken at the beginning of the 83rd congress to improve congressional pro- cedures so that majority rule prevails and decisions can be made after reasonable debate without being blocked by a minority in either house. civil rights. the democratic party is committed to support and advance the individual rights and liberties of all americans. our country is founded on the proposition that all men are created equal. this means that all citizens are equal before the law and should campaign of . | enjoy equal political rights. they should ‘have equal opportunities for education, for economic advancement, and for decent living conditions. we will continue our efforts to eradicate dis- crimination based on race, religion or national origin. we know this task requires action, not just in one section of the nation, but in all sections. it requires the cooperative efforts of individual citi- zens and action by state and local governments. it also requires federal action.. the federal gov- ernment must live up to the ideals of the declara- ‘tion of independence and must exercise the pow- ers vested in it by the constitution. we are proud of the progress that has been made in securing equality of treatment and oppor- tunity in the nation’s armed forces and the civil service and all areas under federal jurisdiction. the department of justice has taken an important part in successfully arguing in the courts for the elimination of many illegal discriminations, in- cluding those involving rights to own and use real property, to engage in gainful occupations and to enroll in publicly supported higher educational institutions. we are determined that the federal government shall continue such policies. at the same time, we favor federal legislation effectively to secure these rights to everyone: () - the right to equal opportunity for employment; () the right to security of persons; () the right to full and equal participation in the nation’s political life, free from arbitrary restraints. we also favor legislation to perfect existing federal civil rights statutes and to strengthen the adminis- trative machinery for the protection of civil rights. conclusion under the guidance, protection, and help of almighty god we shall succeed in bringing to the people of this nation a better and more rewarding life and to the peoples of the entire world, new hope and a lasting, honorable peace. , progressive party platform preamble . cease fire in korea at once—no ifs, ands or buts the american people want peace. in recognition of

plore, however. the widespread current abuses of
its privileges and the maladministration of its pro-
visions for political ends. and pledge ourselves to
correct these evils.

MONEY

The Constitution provides that Congress shall
have the power to “coin money” and “regulate
the value thereof.” This is a sound and feasible
monetary policy which we promise to re-establish
and «nforce.

No Ractat DIscrinin «TION

Recognizing that “God created of one blood all
nations to dwell upon the face of the earth,” we
declare in favor of full justice and equal oppor-
tunity for all people, regardless of race, creed, or
national origin.

M{ARRIAGE AND DIVORCE

We favor the enactment of uniform marriage
and divorce laws as a help toward maintaining the
sanctity of the home.

SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE

The American principle of separation of Church
and State must be maintained. We are opposed
tot .ppropriation of public money for any sec-
tan purpose.

Batrot Law REeForM

We demand the repeal of the many state ballot
laws which have been enacted to make the two-
party system a bipartisan political monopoly by
keeping minor parties off the ballot, thus denying
to independent voters and minority groups the
fundamental right of free political expression.

PROHIBITION

As the result of the repeal of the Eighteenth
Amendment the government now endorses an
industry whose product deranges the mind of the
user and whose propaganda perverts the judgment
of its citizens.

We do not believe that our nation can long
survive if this trend continues.

No other political issue confronting our citizens
compares in magnitude with the necessity for sup-
pressing the alcohol beverage traffic.

The present liquor conditions, which are far
worse than ever before, are due in large measure

to the action of the two major parties when they
adopted platform planks designed to destroy the
Eighteenth Amendment.

The moral forces have to contend with the
liquor power which is well financed, competently
organized. and is creating an ever-growing appe-
tite for its products among youth and adults
through its promotion of the sale of alcoholic
beverages. This power dominates our politics and
government. It controls large numbers of voters.
Every saloon or tavern is a center for mobilizing
and controlling votes. Both parties are subservient
to the liquor power. As long as good citizens
continue to give their votes to the liquor parties,
as long as they continue to be yoked by party
membership with the liquor interests «and the
underworld. they will be incapable of making
moral principles prevail.

What is needed is a re-alignment of voters and
the union of good citizens in a party unitedly
committed to prohibition.

We summon the voters of America to help elect
the Prohibition Party to power. We will then
marshal the resources of the government—execu-
tive. legislative and judicial—to overthrow the
liquor traffic and usher in a new day for America.

1952 Republican Platform
PREAMBLE

We maintain that man was not born to he
ruled, but that he consented to be governed, and
that the reasons that moved him thereto are few
and simple. He has voluntarily submitted to gov-
ernment because, only by the establishment of
just laws. and the power to enforce those laws.

~ can an orderly life be maintained, full and equal

opportunity for all be established, and the bless-
ings of liberty be perpetuated.

We hold that government, and those entrusted
with government, should set a high example of
honesty. of justice, and unselfish devotion to the
public good; that they should labor to maintain
tranquillity at home and peace and friendship
with all the nations of the earth.

We assert that during the last twenty vears,
leaders of the Government of the United States
under successive Democrat Administrations, and
especially under this present Administration, have
failed to perform these several basic duties: but,
on the contrary, that they have evaded them,


flouted them. and by a long succession of vicious
acts. so undermined the foundations of our Re-
public as to threaten ‘s existence.

We charge that they have arrogantly deprived
our citizens of precious liberties by seizing powers
never granted.

We charge that they work unceasingly to
achieve their goal of national socialism. |

We charge that they have disrupted internal
tranquillity by fostering class strife for venal
political purpeses.

We charge t they have choked opportunity
and hampered progress by unnecessary and crush-
ing taxation,

They claim prosperity but the appearance of
economic health is created by war expenditures,
waste and extravagance. planned emergencies, and
war crises. They have debauched our money by
cutting in half the purchasing power of our dollar.

We charge that they have weakened local self-
government which is the cornerstone of the free-
dom of men.

We charge that they have shielded traitors to
the Nation in high places, and that they have
created enemies abroad where we should have
friends.

We charge that they have violated our liberties
by turning loose upon the country a swarm of
arrogant bureaucrats and their agents who meddle
intolerably in the lives and occupations of our
citizens.

We charge that there has been corruption in
high places. and that examples of dishonesty and
dishonor have shamed the moral standards of the
American people.

We charge that they have plunged us into war
in Korea without the consent of our citizens
through their authorized representatives in the
Congress. and have carried on that war without
will to victory.

Foreicn PoLicy

The present Administration, in seven years. has
squandered the unprecedented power and prestige
which were ours at the close of World War IL

[In that time, more than 300 million non-Russian
people of Afteen different countries have been
absarbed into the power sphere of Communist
Russia. which proceeds confidently with its plan
tor world conquest.

We charge that the leaders of the Administra-

CAMPAIGN OF 1952 497

tion in power lost the peace so dearly earned by
World War IL.

The moral incentives and hopes for a better
world which sustained us through World War I
were betraved, and this has given Communist
Russia a military and propaganda initiative which,
if unstaved. will destroy us.

They abandoned friendly nations such as Lat-
via, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland and Czechoslo-
vakia to fend for themselves against the Com-
munist aggression which soon swallowed them.

They required the National Government of
China to surrender Manchuria with its strategic
ports and ra:’ ids to the control of Communist
Russia. Thes .irged that Communists be taken
into the Chinese Government and its military
forces. And finally they denied the military aid
that had been authorized by Congress and which
was crucially needed if China were to be saved.
Thus they substituted on our Pacific fank a mur-
derous enemy for an ally and friend.

In all these respects they flouted our peace-
assuring pledges such as the Atlantic Charter, and
did so in favor of despots, who, it was well-known,
consider that murder, terror, slavery, concentra-
tion camps and the ruthless and brutal denial of
human rights are legitimate means to their desired
ends.

Tehran. Yalta and Potsclam were the scenes of
those tragic blunders with others to follow. The
leaders of the Administration in power acted
without the knowledge or consent of Congress or
of the American people. They traded our over-
whelming victory for a new enemy and for new
oppressions and new wars which were quick to
come.

In South Korea. they withdrew our occupation
troops in the face of the aggressive. poised for
action, Communist military strength on its north-
ern border. They publicly announced that Korea
was of no concern to us. Then when the Com-
munist forces acted to take what seemed to have
been invited, they committed this nation to fight
back under the most unfavorable conditions. Al-
ready the tragic cost is over 110.000 American
casualties.

With foresight, the Korean War would never
have happened.

In going back into Korea, they evoked the
patriotic and sacrificial support of the American
people. But by their hampering orders they pro-

duced stalemates and ignominious bartering with
our enemies, and they offer no hope of victory.

They have effectively ignored many vital areas
in the face of a global threat requiring balanced
handling. .

The people of the other American Republics
are resentful of our neglect of their legitimate
aspirations and cooperative friendship.

The Middle East and much of Africa seethe
with anti-American sentiment.

The peoples of the Far East who are not under
Communist control find it difficult to sustain their
morale as they contrast Russia’s “Asia First” policy
with the “Asia Last” policy of those in control of
the Administration now in power.

Here at home they have exhibited corruption,
incompetence, and disloyalty in public office to
such an extent that the very concept of free
representative government has been tarnished and
has lost its idealistic appeal to those elsewhere
who are confronted with the propaganda of Com-
munism.

They profess to be following a defensive policy
of “containment” of Russian Communism which
has not contained it.

Those in control of the Party in power have, in
reality, no foreign policy. They swing erratically
from timid appeasement to reckless bluster.

The good in our foreign policies has been ac-
complished with Republican cooperation, such as
the crganization of the United Nations, the estab-
lishment of the trusteeship principle for dependent
peoples, the making of peace with Japan and
Germany, and the building of more solid security
in Europe. But in the main the Republican Party
has been ignored and its participation has not
been invited.

The American people must now decide whether
to continue in office the party which has presided
over this disastrous reversal of our fortunes’ and
the loss of our hopes for a peaceful world.

The Republican Party offers, in contrast to the
perfurmances of those now running our foreign
affairs, policies and actions based on enlightened
self-interest and animated by courage, self-respect,
steadfastness, vision, purpose, competence and
spiritual faith.

The supreme goal of our foreign policy will be
an honorable and just peace. We dedicate our-
selves to wage peace and to win it.

We shall eliminate from the State Department

and from every Federal office, all, wherever the:
may be found, who share responsibility for the
needless predicaments and perils in which we find
ourselves. We shall also sever from the public
payroll the hordes of loafers, incompetents and
unnecessary employees who clutter the adminis.
tration of our foreign affairs. The confusions,
overlappings, and extravagance of our egencies
abroad hold us up to the ridicule of peoples whose
friendship we seek.

We shall substitute a compact and efficient or.
ganization where men of proven loyalty and
ability shall have responsibility for reaching our
objectives. They will reflect a dynamic initiative.
Thus we can win the support and confidence
which go only to those who demonstrate 2 ca.
pacity to define and get results.

We shall have positive peace-building objec.
tives wherever this will serve the enlightened self.
interest of our Nation and help to frustrate the
enemy’s designs against us.

In Western Europe we shall use our fricndly
influence, without meddling or imperialistic atti-
tudes, for ending the political and economic
divisions which alone prevent that vital area from
being strong on its own right.

We shall encourage and aid the development
of collective security forces there, as elsewhere,
so as to end the Soviet power to intimidate
directly or by satellites, and so that the free gov-
ernments will be sturdy to resist Communist in-
roads.

In the balanced consideration of our problems,
we shall end neglect of the Far East which Stalin
has long identified as the road to victory over the
West. We shall make it clear that we have no
intention to sacrifice the East to gain time for
the West.

The Republican Party has consistently advo-
cated a national home for the Jewish people since
a Republican Congress declared its support of
that objective thirty years ago.

In providing a sanctuary for Jewish people
rendered homeless by persecution, the State of
Israel appeals to our deepest humanitarian in-
stincts. We shall continue our friendly interest in
this constructive and inspiring undertaking.

We shall put our influence at the service of
peace between Israel and the Arab States, and
we shall cooperate to bring economic and social
stability to that area.


Our tes with the sister Republics of the
Americas will be strengthened.

The Government of the United States, under
Republican leadership, will repudiate all com-
mitiaents contained in scerct understandings such
as those of Yaltu which aid Communist enslave-
ments. le will be made clear, on the highest
authority of the President and the Congress, that
United States policy. as one of its peaceful pur-
poses. luoks Lappily torward to the genuine inde-
pendence of those captive peoples.

We shall again make liberty into a beacon light
of hope that will penetrate the dark places. That
program will give the Voice of America a real
function. It will mark the end of the negative,
futile and immoral! policy of “containment” which
abandons countless human beings to a despotism
and godless terrorism, which in turn enables the
rulers to forge the captives into a weapon for our
destruction.

We shall support the United Nations and loy-
ally help it to become what it was designed to be,
a place where differences would be harmonized
ty honest discussion and a mens for collective
secuiity under agreed concepts of justice. We shall
seek real meaning and value for our regional
security. treaties, which implies that all parties
shall contribute their loyal support and fair shares.

We shall sce to it that no treaty or agreement
with other countries deprives our citizens of the
rights guaranteed them by the Federal Constitu-
tion.

We shall always measure our foreign commit-
ments so that they can be borne without en-
dangering the economic health or sound finances
of the United States. Stalin said that “the moment
for the decisive blow” would be when the free
nations were isolated and were in a state of “prac-
tical bankruptcy.” We shall not allow ourselves
to be isolated and economically strangled, and we
shall not let ourselves go bankrupt.

Sums available by this test, if competently used,
will be more effective than vastly larger sums in-
competently spent for vague and endless purposes.
We shall not try to buy good will. We shall earn

geous world trade. To further this objective we
shall press for the elimination of discriminatory
practices against our exports, such as preferential
tariffs, monetary license restrictions, and other
arbitrary devices. Our reciprocal trade agree-
ments «| be entered into and maintained on a
basis ot crue reciprocity, and to safeguard our
domestic enterprises and the payrolis of our work-
ers against unfair import competition.

The policies we espouse will revive the con-
tagious, liberating influences which are inlerent
in freedom. They will inevitably set up strains
and stresses within the captive world which will
make the rulers impotent to continue in their
monstrous ways and mark the beginning of their
end,

Our nation will become again the Gvnaimic,
moral and spiritual force which was the despair of
despots and the hope of the oppressed. As we
resume this historic role, we ourselves will come
to enjoy again the reality of peace, security and
solvency, not the shabby and fleeting comnterfeit
which is the gift of the Administration in power

Nationa Derense

On the prudent assumption that Communist
Russia may not accommodate our own disgrace-
fully-lagging program for preparcdness, we should
develop with utmost speed a force-in-being, as
distinguished from paper plans, of such power
as to deter sudden attack or promptly and de-
cisively defeut it. This defense against sudden
attack requires the quickest possible development
of appropriate and completely-adequate air power
and the simultaneous readiness of coordinated air,
land, and sea forces, with all necessary instal-
lations, bases, supplies and munitions, including
atomic energy weapons in abundance.

Generally, we shall see to it that our military
services are adequately supported in all ways re-
quired, including manpower, to perform their ap-
propriate tasks in relation to the defense of this
country and to meet our treaty obligations.

We shall coordinate our miltary policy with our
foreign policy, always seeking universal limitation
and control of armaments on a dependable basis.

We shall review our entire preparedness pro-
gram and we shall strip it clean of waste, Iack of
coordination, inertia, and conflict between the
services. We shall see that our fighting men in
Korea, or wherever they may be, shall not lack

the best of weapons or other supplies or services
needed for their welfare.

ComMMUNISM

By the Administration's appeasement of Com-
munism at home and abroad it has permitted
Communists and their fellow travelers to serve in
many key agencies and to infiltrate our American
life. When such infiltrations became notorious
through the revelations of Republicans in Con-
gress. the Executive Department stubbornly re-
fused to deal with it openly and vigorously. It
raised the false cry of “red herring” and took other
measures to block and discredit investigations. It
denied files and information to Congress. It set
up boards of its own to keep information secret
and to deal lightly with security risks and persons
of doubtful loyalty. It only undertook prosecution
of the most notorious Communists after public
opinion forced action.

The result of these policies is the needless sacri-
fice of American lives, a crushing cost in dollars
for defense, possession by Russia of the atomic
bomb. the lowering of the Iron Curtain, and the
present threats to world peace. Our people have
been mired in fear and distrust and employees of
integrity in the Government service have been
cruelly maligned by the Administration’s tolerance
of people of doubtful loyalty.

There are no Communists in the Republican
Party. We have always recognized Communism
to be a world conspiracy against freedom and
religion. We never compromised with Com-
munism and we have fought to expose it and to
eliminate it in government and American life.

A Republican President will appoint only per-
sons of unquestioned loyalty. We will overhaul
lovalty and security programs. In achieving these
purposes a Republican President will cooperate
with Congress. We pledge close coordination of
our intelligence services for protecting our se-
curity. We pledge fair but vigorous enforcement
of laws to safeguard our country from subversion
and cislovalty. By such policies we will keep the
country secure and restore the confidence of the
American people in the integrity of our Covern-
ment.

SmaLL BUSINESS IN A FREE Economy

For twenty vears the Administration has praised
free enterprise while actually wrecking it. Here

a little, there a little, year by year, it has sought
to curb, regulate, harass, restrain and punish
There is scarcely a phase of our economic and
social life today in which Government does not
attempt to interfere.

Such hostility deadens initiative, discourages
invention and experiment, and weakens the self.
reliance indispensable to the Nation's Vitality,
Merciless taxation, the senseless use of controls
and ceaseless effort to enter business on its own
account, have led the present Government to un.
restrained waste and extravagance in spending,
irresponsibility in decision and corruption in ad.
ministration.

The anti-monopoly laws have been employed,
not to preserve and foster competition, but to
further the political ambitions of the men in
power. Wage and price controls have been uti-
lized, not to maintain economic stability, but to
reward the friends and punish the enemies of
leaders of the Party in power.

Neither small nor large business can flourish
in such an atmosphere. The Republican Party
will end this hostility to initiative and enterprise.

We will aid small business in every practicable
way. We shall remove tax abuses and injurious
price and wage controls. Efforts to plan and regu-
late every phase of small business activity will
cease. We will maintain special committees in
Congress whose chief function will be to study
and review continuously the problems of small
business and recommend legislation for their re-
lief. We shall always be mindful of the impor-
tance of keeping open the channels of opportunity
for young men and women.

We will follow principles of equal enforcement
of the anti-monopoly and unfair-competition stat-
utes and will simplify their administration to assist
the businessman who, in good faith, seeks to re-
main in compliance. At the same time, we shall
relentlessly protect our free enterprise system
against monopolistic and unfair trade practices.

We will oppose Federal rent control except in
those areas where the expansion of defense pro-
duction has been accompanied by critical housing
shortages. With local cooperation we shall aid
slum clearance.

Our goal is a balanced budget, a reduced
national debt, an economical administration and
a cut in taxes. We believe in combating inflation


by encouraging full production of goods and food,
and not through a program of restrictions.

TaxaTioN aND Monetary Poticy

Only with a sound economy can we properly
carry out both the domestic and foreign policies
which we advocate. The wanton extravagance
and inflationary policies of the Administration in
power have ont the value of the dollar in half and
imposed the most confiscatory taxes in our history.
These policies have made the effective control of
Government expenditures impossible. If this Ad-
ministration is left in power, it will further
cheapen the dollar, rob the wage eamer, im-
poverish the farmer and reduce the true value
of the savings, pensions, insurance and invest-
ments of millions of our people. Further inflation
must be and can be prevented. Sound tax and
monetary policies are essential to this end. We
advocate the following tax policies:

1. Reduction of expenditures by the elimina-
tion of waste and extravagance so that the
budget will be balanced and a general tax re-
duction can be made.

2. An immediate study directed toward re-
allocation of fields of taxation between the
Federal, State. and municipal governments so
as to allow greater fiscal freedom to the States
and municipalities, thus minimizing double
taxation and enabling the various divisions of
government to meet their obligations more effi-
ciently.

3, A thorough revision and codification of
the present hodge-podge of internal revenue
laws.

4. Administration of the tax laws free from
politics. favoritism and corruption.

We advocate the following monetary policies:

1. A Federal Reserve System exercising its
functions in the money and credit system with-
out pressure for political purposes from the
Treasury or the White House.

2. To restore a domestic economy, and to
use our influence for a world economy, of such
stability as will permit the realization of our
aim of a dollar on a fully-convertible gold basis.

AGRICULTURE

The good earth is the food storehouse for future
generations. The tending of the soil is a sacred
responsibility. Development of a sound farm pro-

CAMPAIGN OF 1952 501

gram is a high national duty. Any program that
will benefit fai :ers must serve the national wel-
fare. A prosperous agriculture with free and inde-
pendent farmers is fundamental to the national
interest.

We charge the present Administration with
seeking to destroy the farmers’ freedom. We de-
nounce the Administration’s use of tax money and
a multitude of Federal agencies to put agriculture
under partisan political dictation and to make the
farmer dependent upon government. We con-
demn the Brannan plan which aims to control the
farmer and to socialize agriculture. We brand as
unscrupulous the Administration’s manipulation of
grain markets during the 1948 election campaign
to drive down farm prices, and its deliberate mis-
representation of Jaws passed by the Republican
80th Congress, which authorized a long-range
farm price support program and provided for ade-
quate grain storage.

We condemn as a fraud on both the farmer and
the consumer the Brannan plan scheme to pay
direct subsidies from the Federal Treasury in lieu
of prices to producers.

We favor a farm program aimed at full parity
prices for all farm products in the market place.
Our program includes commodity loans on non-
perishable products, “on-the-farm” storage, suffi-
cient farm credit, and voluntary self-supporting
crop insurance. Where government action on
perishable commodities is desirable, we recom-
mend locally-controlled marketing agreements and
other voluntary methods.

Our program should include commodity loans
on all non-perishable products supported at the
level necessary to maintain a balanced production.
We do not believe in restrictions on the American
farmers’ ability to produce.

We favor a bi-partisan Federal Agricultural
Commission with power to review the policies and
administration of our farm programs and to make
recommendations.

We support a constructive and expanded soil
conservation program administered through lo-
cally-controlled local districts, and which shall
emphasize that payments shall be made for prac-
tices and improvements of a permanent nature.

Flood control programs should include the
application of sound land use, reforestation and
water-management practices on each watershed.
These, so far as feasible, should be decentralized

tte et nnn att RE TORSSAR,

502 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

and locally-controlled to insure economy and ef-
fective soil conservation.

We recommend expanded agricultural research
and education to premote new crops and uses,
new markets, both foreign and domestic, more
trustworthy crop and market estimates, a realistic
trade program fer agriculture aimed at restoring
foreign markets and developing new outlets at
home. Proniction of world trade must be on a
basis of fair competition.

We support the principle of bona fide farmer-
owned, farmer-operated co-operatives and urge
the further development of rural electrification and
communication, with federallv-assisted production
of power and facilities for distribution when these
are not adequately available through private
enterprise at fair rates.

We insist that an adequate supply .: manpower
on the farm is necessary to our national welfare
and security and shall do those things required
to assure this result.

The Republican Party will create conditions
providing for farm prosperity and stability, safe-
guarding the farmers’ independence and opening
opportunities for young people in rural communi-
ties. We will do those things necessary to sim-
plify and make efficient the operation of the
Department of Agriculture, prevent that Depart-
ment from assuming powers neither intended nor
delegated by Congress, and to place the adminis-
tration of farm programs as closely as possible to
State and local levels.

Lasor

The Republican Party believes that regular and
adequate income for the employee together with
uninterrupted production of goods and services,
through the medium of private enterprise, are
essential to a sound national economy. This can
only be obtained in an era of industrial peace.

With the above in mind, we favor the retention
of the Taft-Hartley Act, which guarantees:

To the Working Man:—

The right to quit his job at any time.

The right to take part in legal union activi-
ties.

The right to remain in his union so long as
he pays his dues.

The right to protection against unfair prac-
tices by either employer or union officials.

The right to political activity of his own
choice and freedom to contribute thereto.

The right to a job without first joining a
union.

The right to a seerct ballot in any election
concerned with his livelihood.

The right to protection from personal finan-
cial responsibility in damage cases against his
union.

To the Labor Unions:

The right to establish “union shop” contracts
by agreement with management.

The right to strike.

The right to free collective bargaining.

The right to protection from rival unions
during the life of union contracts.

The right to assurance from employers that
they will bargain only with certified unions as

a protection against unfair labor practices.

We urge the adoption of such amendments to
the Taft-Hartley Act as time and experience show
to be desirable, and which further protect the
rights of labor, management and the public.

We condemn the President’s seizure of plants
and industries to force the settlement of labor
disputes by claims of inherent Constitutional
powers.

NatTurnat RESOURCES

We vigorously advocate a full and orderly pro-
gram for the development and conservation of our
natural resources.

We deplore the policies of the present Ad-
ministration which allow special premiums to
foreign producers of minerals available in the
United States. We favor reasonable depletion
allowances, defense procurement policies, syn-
thetic fuels research, and public land policies,
including good-faith administration of our mining
laws, which will encourage exploration and de-
velopment of our mineral resources consistent with
our growing industrial and defense needs.

We favor stockpiling of strategic and critical
raw materials and special premium incentives for
their domestic exploration and development.

We favor restoration to the States of their rights
to all lands and resources beneath navigable in-
land and offshore waters within their historic
boundaries.

We favor protection of our fisheries by domestic


regulation and treaties, including safeguards
against unfair foreign competition.

Pesric Works axp WaTER POLicy

The Federal Government and State and local
governments should continuously plan programs
ot economically justifiable public works.

We favor continuous and comprehensive investi-
gations of our water resources and orderly execu-
tion cf programs approved by the Congress. Au-
thorized water projects should go forward pro-
gressively with immediate priority tor those with
defense significance, those in critical flood and
water-shortage areas, and those substantially com-
pleted.

We favor greater local participation in the
operation and control, and eventual local owner-
ship. of federally-sponsored, reimbursable water
projects.

We vigorously oppose the efforts of this national
Administration, in California and elsewhere, to
undermine state control over water use, to acquire
paramount water rights without just compensation,
and to establish all-powerful federal socialistic
valley authorities.

Pusric Lanps

We favor restoration of the traditional Republi-
can public land policy, which provided oppor-
tunity for ownership by citizens to promote the
highest land use. We favor an impartial study of
tax-free Federal lands and their uses to determine
their effects on the economic and fiscal structures
of our States and local communities.

In the management of public lands and forests
we pledge the elimination of arbitrary bureau-
cratic practices. To this end we favor legislation
to define the rights and privileges of grazers and
other cooperators and users, to provide the pro-
tection of independent judicial review against ad-
ministrative invasions of those rights and privi-
leges, and to protect the public against corrupt
or monopolistic exploitation and bureaucratic
favoritism.

VETERANS

We believe that active duty in the Armed
Forces of the United States of America during a
state of war or national emergency constitutes a
special service to our Nation, and entitles those

CAMPAIGN OF 1952 503

who have so served to aid and compensation in
return for this service.
Consequently we propose:

That the aid and compensation given to
veterans of previous wars be extended to vet-
erans of the Korcan conflict;

That compensation be fairly and adequately
adjusted ta meet changes in the cost of living:

That aid be given to veterans, particularly
disabled veterans, to obtain suitable emplov-
ment, by providing training and education. and
through strict compliance with veterans’ prefer-
ence laws in Federal service;

That the Veterans’ Administration be main-
tained as a single, independent agency in full
charge of all veterans’ affairs, and that the
Veterans’ Administration manage veterans’ af-
fairs in an efficient, prompt and uniform man-
ner:

That the Veterans’ Administration should be
equipped to provide and maintain medica! and
hospital care of the highest possible standard
for all eligible veterans.

SociaL SECURITY

Inflation has already cut in half the purchasing
power of the retirement and other benefits under
the Federal Old Age and Survivors Insurance
system. Sixty million persons are covered under
the system and four and one-half million are now
receiving benefits.

The best assurance of preserving the benefits
for which the worker has paid is to stop the infla-
tion which causes the tragic loss of purchasing
power, and that we propose to do.

We favor amendment of the Old Age and Sur-
vivors Insurance system to provide coverage for
those justly entitled to it but who are now ex-
cluded.

We shall work to achieve a simple, more effec-
tive and more economical method of administra-
tion.

We shall make a thorough study of universal
pay-as-we-go pension plans.

HEALTH

We recognize that the health of our people as
well as their proper medical care cannot be main-
tained if subject to Federal bureaucratic dictation.
There should be a division of responsibility be-


504 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

tween government, the physician, the voluntary
hospital. and voluntary health insurance. We are
opposed to Federal compulsory health insurance
with its crushing cost, wasteful inefficiency, bu-
reaucratic dead weight. and debased standards of
medical care. We shall support those health ac-
tivittes by government which stimulate the de-
velopment of adequate hospital services without
Federal interference in local administration. We
favor support of scientific research. We pledge
our continuous encouragement of improved meth-
ods of assuring health protection.

EDUCATION

The tradition of popular education, tax-sup-
ported and free to all, is strong with our people.
The responsibility for sustaining this system of
popular education has always rested upon the
local communities and the States. We subscribe
fully to this principle.

Civic Ricuts

We condemn bigots who inject class, racial and
religious prejudice into public and political mat-
ters. Bigotry is un-American and a danger to the
Republic.

We deplore the duplicity and insincerity of the
Party in power in racial and religious matters. Al-
though they have been in office as a Majority
Party for many years, they have not kept nor do
they intend to keep their promises.

The Republican Party will not mislead, exploit
or attempt to confuse minority groups for political
purposes. All American citizens are entitled to
full, impartial enforcement of Federal laws re-
lating to their civil rights.

We believe that it is the primary responsibility
of each State to order and control its own do-
mestic institutions, and this power, reserved to the
states. is essential to the maintenance of our Fed-
eral Republic. However, we believe that the
Federal Government should take supplemental
action within its constitutional jurisdiction to
oppose discrimination against race, religion or
national origin. .

We will prove our good faith by:

Appointing qualified persons, without distinc-
tion of race, religion or national origin, to
responsible positions in the Government.

Federal action toward the elimination of
lynching.

Federal action toward the elimination of poll
taxes as a prerequisite to voting.

Appropriate action to end segregation in the
District of Columbia.

Enacting Federal legislation to further just
and equitable treatment in the area of discrimi-
natory employment practices. Federal action
should not duplicate state efforts tu end such
practices: should not set up another huge bu-
reaucracy.

CENSORSHIP

We pledge not to infringe by censorship or gag-
order the right of a free people to know what their
Government is doing.

Eevar RicHts

We recommend to Congress the submission of a
Constitutional Amendment providing equal rights
for men and women.

We favor legislation assuring equal pay for
equal work regardless of sex.

STATEHOOD

We favor immediate statehood for Hawaii.

We favor statehood for Alaska under an equita-
ble enabling act.

We favor eventual statehood for Puerto Rico.

District OF COLUMBIA

We favor self-government and national suffrage
for the residents of the Nation’s Capital.

INDIAN AFFAIRS

All Indians are citizens of the United States
and no longer should be denied full enjovment of
their rights of citizenship.

We shall eliminate the existing shameful waste
by the Bureau of Indian Affairs which has ob-
structed the accomplishment of our national
responsibility for improving the condition of our
Indian friends. We pledge to undertake programs
to provide the Indians with equal opportunities
for education, health protection and economic
development.

The next Republican Administration will wel-
come the advice and counsel of Indian leaders in
selecting the Indian Commissioner.

Civit SERVICE

We condemn the flagrant violations of the Civil
Service merit system by the Party in power.


We favor a personnel program for the Federal
career service comparable to the best practices of
progressive private employers. Federal employees
shall be selected under a strengthened and ex-
tended merit system. Civil servants of ability and
integrity shall receive proper recognition, with
merit the sole test for promotion.

DELIVERY OF MaiL

We pledge a more efficient and frequent mail
delivery service.

GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION

We pledge a thorough reorganization of the
Federal Government in accordance with the prin-
ciples set forth in the report of the Hoover Com-
mission which was established by the Republican
80th Congress.

We denounce the duplicity in submitting to
Congress for approval, reorganization plans which
were represented as being in accordance with the
principles of the Hoover Commission recommen-
dations, but which in fact were actually intended
to further partisan political purposes of the Ad-
ministration in power.

CORRUPTION

The present Administration’s sordid record of
corruption has shocked and sickened the American
people. Its leaders have forfeited any right to
public faith by the way they transact the Federal
Government’s business.

Fraud, bribery, graft, favoritism and infuence-
peddling have come to light. Immorality and un-
ethical behavior have been found to exist among
some who were entrusted with high policy-making
positions, and there have been disclosures of close
alliances between the present Government and
underworld characters.

Republicans exposed cases of questionable and
criminal conduct and relentlessly pressed for full
investigations into the cancer-like spread of cor-
ruption in the Administration. These investiga-
tions uncovered a double standard in Federal tax
law enforcement—lenient treatment to political
favorites including even some gangsters and
crooks, but harassment and threats of prosecution
for many honest taxpayers over minor discrepan-
cies.

Besides tax fixes and scandals in the Internal
Revenue Bureau, investigations have disclosed

CAMPAIGN OF 1952 505

links between high officials and crime, favoritism
and influence in the RFC, profiteering in grain,
sale of postmasterships, tanker-ship deals in the
Maritime Commission, ballot-box stuffing and
thievery, and bribes and pay-offs in contract
awards by officials in agencies exercising ex-
traordinary powers and disbursing billions of
dollars.

Under public pressure, the Administration took
reluctant steps to clean house. But it was so eager
to cover up and block more revelations that its
clean-up drive launched with much fanfare ended
in a farce.

The Republican Party pledges to put an end
to corruption, to oust the crooks and grafters, to
administer tax laws fairly and impartially, and to
restore honest government to the people.

REPUBLICAN 80TH CoNGRESS

The Republican Party does not rest its case
upon promises alone. We have a record of per-
formance which was grossly defamed by the Party
in power. The Republican 80th Congress launched
the program to stop Communism; unified the
armed services; authorized a 70-group Air Force
which the President blocked; enacted a national
service law; balanced the budget; accumulated
an eight-billion-dollar surplus; reduced taxes, with
70 per cent of the tax savings to those with in-
comes under $5,000; freed 7,400,000 wage earn-
ers in the lower brackets from having to pay any
further income tax at all, allowed married couples
to divide their incomes for tax purposes, and
granted an additional $600 exemption to those
over 65 years of age and to the blind; enacted
the Taft-Hartley law for equitable labor-manage-
ment relations; passed the first long-range agri-
culture program; increased social security bene-
fits; and carried out every single pledge they made
to the voters in the 1946 election.

CONCLUSION

Upon this statement of truths and this pledge of
performance, the Republican Party stands confi-
dent that it expresses the hopes of the citizens of
America and certain that it points out with in-
tegrity a road upon which free men may march
into a new day—a new and better day—in which
shall be fulfilled the decent aspirations of our
people for peace, for solvency and for the fulfill-
ment of our best welfare, under the guidance of

the government now endorses an industry whose product deranges the mind of the user and whose propaganda perverts the judgment of its citizens. we do not believe that our nation can long survive if this trend continues. no other political issue confronting our citizens compares in magnitude with the necessity for sup- pressing the alcohol beverage traffic. the present liquor conditions, which are far worse than ever before, are due in large measure to the action of the two major parties when they adopted platform planks designed to destroy the eighteenth amendment. the moral forces have to contend with the liquor power which is well financed, competently organized. and is creating an ever-growing appe- tite for its products among youth and adults through its promotion of the sale of alcoholic beverages. this power dominates our politics and government. it controls large numbers of voters. every saloon or tavern is a center for mobilizing and controlling votes. both parties are subservient to the liquor power. as long as good citizens continue to give their votes to the liquor parties, as long as they continue to be yoked by party membership with the liquor interests «and the underworld. they will be incapable of making moral principles prevail. what is needed is a re-alignment of voters and the union of good citizens in a party unitedly committed to prohibition. we summon the voters of america to help elect the prohibition party to power. we will then marshal the resources of the government—execu- tive. legislative and judicial—to overthrow the liquor traffic and usher in a new day for america. republican platform preamble we maintain that man was not born to he ruled, but that he consented to be governed, and that the reasons that moved him thereto are

conquest. we charge that the leaders of the administra- campaign of tion in power lost the peace so dearly earned by world war il. the moral incentives and hopes for a better world which sustained us through world war i were betraved, and this has given communist russia a military and propaganda initiative which, if unstaved. will destroy us. they abandoned friendly nations such as lat- via, lithuania, estonia, poland and czechoslo- vakia to fend for themselves against the com- munist aggression which soon swallowed them. they required the national government of china to surrender manchuria with its strategic ports and ra:’ ids to the control of communist russia. thes .irged that communists be taken into the chinese government and its military forces. and finally they denied the military aid that had been authorized by congress and which was crucially needed if china were to be saved. thus they substituted on our pacific fank a mur- derous enemy for an ally and friend. in all these respects they flouted our peace- assuring pledges such as the atlantic charter, and did so in favor of despots, who, it was well-known, consider that murder, terror, slavery, concentra- tion camps and the ruthless and brutal denial of human rights are legitimate means to their desired ends. tehran. yalta and potsclam were the scenes of those tragic blunders with others to follow. the leaders of the administration in power acted without the knowledge or consent of congress or of the american people. they traded our over- whelming victory for a new enemy and for new oppressions and new wars which were quick to come. in south korea. they withdrew our occupation troops in the face of the aggressive. poised for action, communist military strength on its north- ern border. they publicly announced that korea was of no concern to us. then when the com- munist forces acted to take what seemed to have been invited, they committed this nation to fight back under the most unfavorable conditions. al- ready the tragic cost is over . american casualties. with foresight, the korean war would never have happened. in going back into korea, they evoked the patriotic and sacrificial support of the american people. but by their hampering orders they pro- national party platforms duced stalemates and ignominious bartering with our enemies, and they offer no hope of victory. they have effectively ignored many vital areas in the face of a global threat requiring balanced handling. . the people of the other american republics are resentful of our neglect of their legitimate aspirations and cooperative friendship. the middle east and much of africa seethe with anti-american sentiment. the peoples of the far east who are not under communist control find it difficult to sustain their morale as they contrast russia’s “asia first” policy with the “asia last” policy of those in control of the administration now in power. here at home they have exhibited corruption, incompetence, and disloyalty in public office to such an extent that the very concept of free representative government has been tarnished and has lost its idealistic appeal to those elsewhere who are confronted with the propaganda of com- munism. they profess to be following a defensive policy of “containment” of russian communism which has not contained it. those in control of the party in power have, in reality, no foreign policy. they swing erratically from timid appeasement to reckless bluster. the good in our foreign policies has been ac- complished with republican cooperation, such as the crganization of the united nations, the estab- lishment of the trusteeship principle for dependent peoples, the making of peace with japan and germany, and the building of more solid security in europe. but in the main the republican party has been ignored and its participation has not been invited. the american people must now decide whether to continue in office the party which has presided over this disastrous reversal of our fortunes’ and the loss of our hopes for a peaceful world. the republican party offers, in contrast to the perfurmances of those now running our foreign affairs, policies and actions based on enlightened self-interest and animated by courage, self-respect, steadfastness, vision, purpose, competence and spiritual faith. the supreme goal of our foreign policy will be an honorable and just peace. we dedicate our- selves to wage peace and to win it. we shall eliminate from the state department and from every federal office, all, wherever the: may be found, who share responsibility for the needless predicaments and perils in which we find ourselves. we shall also sever from the public payroll the hordes of loafers, incompetents and unnecessary employees who clutter the adminis. tration of our foreign affairs. the confusions, overlappings, and extravagance of our egencies abroad hold us up to the ridicule of peoples whose friendship we seek. we shall substitute a compact and efficient or. ganization where men of proven loyalty and ability shall have responsibility for reaching our objectives. they will reflect a dynamic initiative. thus we can win the support and confidence which go only to those who demonstrate ca. pacity to define and get results. we shall have positive peace-building objec. tives wherever this will serve the enlightened self. interest of our nation and help to frustrate the enemy’s designs against us. in western europe we shall use our fricndly influence, without meddling or imperialistic atti- tudes, for ending the political and economic divisions which alone prevent that vital area from being strong on its own right. we shall encourage and aid the development of collective security forces there, as elsewhere, so as to end the soviet power to intimidate directly or by satellites, and so that the free gov- ernments will be sturdy to resist communist in- roads. in the balanced consideration of our problems, we shall end neglect of the far east which stalin has long identified as the road to victory over the west. we shall make it clear that we have no intention to sacrifice the east to gain time for the west. the republican party has consistently advo- cated a national home for the jewish people since a republican congress declared its support of that objective thirty years ago. in providing a sanctuary for jewish people rendered homeless by persecution, the state of israel appeals to our deepest humanitarian in- stincts. we shall continue our friendly interest in this constructive and inspiring undertaking. we shall put our influence at the service of peace between israel and the arab states, and we shall cooperate to bring economic and social stability to that area. our tes with the sister republics of the americas will be strengthened. the government of the united states, under republican leadership, will repudiate all com- mitiaents contained in scerct understandings such as those of yaltu which aid communist enslave- ments. le will be made clear, on the highest authority of the president and the congress, that united states policy. as one of its peaceful pur- poses. luoks lappily torward to the genuine inde- pendence of those captive peoples. we shall again make liberty into a beacon light of hope that will penetrate the dark places. that program will give the voice of america a real function. it will mark the end of the negative, futile and immoral! policy of “containment” which abandons countless human beings to a despotism and godless terrorism, which in turn enables the rulers to forge the captives into a weapon for our destruction. we shall support the united nations and loy- ally help it to become what it was designed to be, a place where differences would be harmonized ty honest discussion and a mens for collective secuiity under agreed concepts of justice. we shall seek real meaning and value for our regional security. treaties, which implies that all parties shall contribute their loyal support and fair shares. we shall sce to it that no treaty or agreement with other countries deprives our citizens of the rights guaranteed them by the federal constitu- tion. we shall always measure our foreign commit- ments so that they can be borne without en- dangering the economic health or sound finances of the united states. stalin said that “the moment for the decisive blow” would be when the free nations were isolated and were in a state of “prac- tical bankruptcy.” we shall not allow ourselves to be isolated and economically strangled, and we shall not let ourselves go bankrupt. sums available by this test, if competently used, will be more effective than vastly larger sums in- competently spent for vague and endless purposes. we shall not try to buy good will. we shall earn ‘r hy sound, constructive. self-respecting policies cad actcons. ; \we favor international exchange of students ancl of agricultural and industrial techniques, and pr-grams for improvement of public health. we favor the expansion of mutually-advanta- campaign of geous world trade. to further this objective we shall press for the elimination of discriminatory practices against our exports, such as preferential tariffs, monetary license restrictions, and other arbitrary devices. our reciprocal trade agree- ments «| be entered into and maintained on a basis ot crue reciprocity, and to safeguard our domestic enterprises and the payrolis of our work- ers against unfair import competition. the policies we espouse will revive the con- tagious, liberating influences which are inlerent in freedom. they will inevitably set up strains and stresses within the captive world which will make the rulers impotent to continue in their monstrous ways and mark the beginning of their end, our nation will become again the gvnaimic, moral and spiritual force which was the despair of despots and the hope of the oppressed. as we resume this historic role, we ourselves will come to enjoy again the reality of peace, security and solvency, not the shabby and fleeting comnterfeit which is the gift of the administration in power nationa derense on the prudent assumption that communist russia may not accommodate our own disgrace- fully-lagging program for preparcdness, we should develop with utmost speed a force-in-being, as distinguished from paper plans, of such power as to deter sudden attack or promptly and de- cisively defeut it. this defense against sudden attack requires the quickest possible development of appropriate and completely-adequate air power and the simultaneous readiness of coordinated air, land, and sea forces, with all necessary instal- lations, bases, supplies and munitions, including atomic energy weapons in abundance. generally, we shall see to it that our military services are adequately supported in all ways re- quired, including manpower, to perform their ap- propriate tasks in relation to the defense of this country and to meet our treaty obligations. we shall coordinate our miltary policy with our foreign policy, always seeking universal limitation and control of armaments on a dependable basis. we shall review our entire preparedness pro- gram and we shall strip it clean of waste, iack of coordination, inertia, and conflict between the services. we shall see that our fighting men in korea, or wherever they may be, shall not lack +e mw national party platforms the best of weapons or other supplies or services needed for their welfare. commmunism by the administration's appeasement of com- munism at home and abroad it has permitted communists and their fellow travelers to serve in many key agencies and to infiltrate our american life. when such infiltrations became notorious through the revelations of republicans in con- gress. the executive department stubbornly re- fused to deal with it openly and vigorously. it raised the false cry of “red herring” and took other measures to block and discredit investigations. it denied files and information to congress. it set up boards of its own to keep information secret and to deal lightly with security risks and persons of doubtful loyalty. it only undertook prosecution of the most notorious communists after public opinion forced action. the result of these policies is the needless sacri- fice of american lives, a crushing cost in dollars for defense, possession by russia of the atomic bomb. the lowering of the iron curtain, and the present threats to world peace. our people have been mired in fear and distrust and employees of integrity in the government service have been cruelly maligned by the administration’s tolerance of people of doubtful loyalty. there are no communists in the republican party. we have always recognized communism to be a world conspiracy against freedom and religion. we never compromised with com- munism and we have fought to expose it and to eliminate it in government and american life. a republican president will appoint only per- sons of unquestioned loyalty. we will overhaul lovalty and security programs. in achieving these purposes a republican president will cooperate with congress. we pledge close coordination of our intelligence services for protecting our se- curity. we pledge fair but vigorous enforcement of laws to safeguard our country from subversion and cislovalty. by such policies we will keep the country secure and restore the confidence of the american people in the integrity of our covern- ment. small business in a free economy for twenty vears the administration has praised free enterprise while actually wrecking it. here a little, there a little, year by year, it has sought to curb, regulate, harass, restrain and punish there is scarcely a phase of our economic and social life today in which government does not attempt to interfere. such hostility deadens initiative, discourages invention and experiment, and weakens the self. reliance indispensable to the nation's vitality, merciless taxation, the senseless use of controls and ceaseless effort to enter business on its own account, have led the present government to un. restrained waste and extravagance in spending, irresponsibility in decision and corruption in ad. ministration. the anti-monopoly laws have been employed, not to preserve and foster competition, but to further the political ambitions of the men in power. wage and price controls have been uti- lized, not to maintain economic stability, but to reward the friends and punish the enemies of leaders of the party in power. neither small nor large business can flourish in such an atmosphere. the republican party will end this hostility to initiative and enterprise. we will aid small business in every practicable way. we shall remove tax abuses and injurious price and wage controls. efforts to plan and regu- late every phase of small business activity will cease. we will maintain special committees in congress whose chief function will be to study and review continuously the problems of small business and recommend legislation for their re- lief. we shall always be mindful of the impor- tance of keeping open the channels of opportunity for young men and women. we will follow principles of equal enforcement of the anti-monopoly and unfair-competition stat- utes and will simplify their administration to assist the businessman who, in good faith, seeks to re- main in compliance. at the same time, we shall relentlessly protect our free enterprise system against monopolistic and unfair trade practices. we will oppose federal rent control except in those areas where the expansion of defense pro- duction has been accompanied by critical housing shortages. with local cooperation we shall aid slum clearance. our goal is a balanced budget, a reduced national debt, an economical administration and a cut in taxes. we believe in combating inflation by encouraging full production of goods and food, and not through a program of restrictions. taxation and monetary poticy only with a sound economy can we properly carry out both the domestic and foreign policies which we advocate. the wanton extravagance and inflationary policies of the administration in power have ont the value of the dollar in half and imposed the most confiscatory taxes in our history. these policies have made the effective control of government expenditures impossible. if this ad- ministration is left in power, it will further cheapen the dollar, rob the wage eamer, im- poverish the farmer and reduce the true value of the savings, pensions, insurance and invest- ments of millions of our people. further inflation must be and can be prevented. sound tax and monetary policies are essential to this end. we advocate the following tax policies: . reduction of expenditures by the elimina- tion of waste and extravagance so that the budget will be balanced and a general tax re- duction can be made. . an immediate study directed toward re- allocation of fields of taxation between the federal, state. and municipal governments so as to allow greater fiscal freedom to the states and municipalities, thus minimizing double taxation and enabling the various divisions of government to meet their obligations more effi- ciently. , a thorough revision and codification of the present hodge-podge of internal revenue laws. . administration of the tax laws free from politics. favoritism and corruption. we advocate the following monetary policies: . a federal reserve system exercising its functions in the money and credit system with- out pressure for political purposes from the treasury or the white house. . to restore a domestic economy, and to use our influence for a world economy, of such stability as will permit the realization of our aim of a dollar on a fully-convertible gold basis. agriculture the good earth is the food storehouse for future generations. the tending of the soil is a sacred responsibility. development of a sound farm pro- campaign of gram is a high national duty. any program that will benefit fai :ers must serve the national wel- fare. a prosperous agriculture with free and inde- pendent farmers is fundamental to the national interest. we charge the present administration with seeking to destroy the farmers’ freedom. we de- nounce the administration’s use of tax money and a multitude of federal agencies to put agriculture under partisan political dictation and to make the farmer dependent upon government. we con- demn the brannan plan which aims to control the farmer and to socialize agriculture. we brand as unscrupulous the administration’s manipulation of grain markets during the election campaign to drive down farm prices, and its deliberate mis- representation of jaws passed by the republican 80th congress, which authorized a long-range farm price support program and provided for ade- quate grain storage. we condemn as a fraud on both the farmer and the consumer the brannan plan scheme to pay direct subsidies from the federal treasury in lieu of prices to producers. we favor a farm program aimed at full parity prices for all farm products in the market place. our program includes commodity loans on non- perishable products, “on-the-farm” storage, suffi- cient farm credit, and voluntary self-supporting crop insurance. where government action on perishable commodities is desirable, we recom- mend locally-controlled marketing agreements and other voluntary methods. our program should include commodity loans on all non-perishable products supported at the level necessary to maintain a balanced production. we do not believe in restrictions on the american farmers’ ability to produce. we favor a bi-partisan federal agricultural commission with power to review the policies and administration of our farm programs and to make recommendations. we support a constructive and expanded soil conservation program administered through lo- cally-controlled local districts, and which shall emphasize that payments shall be made for prac- tices and improvements of a permanent nature. flood control programs should include the application of sound land use, reforestation and water-management practices on each watershed. these, so far as feasible, should be decentralized tte et nnn att re torssar, es meee national party platforms and locally-controlled to insure economy and ef- fective soil conservation. we recommend expanded agricultural research and education to premote new crops and uses, new markets, both foreign and domestic, more trustworthy crop and market estimates, a realistic trade program fer agriculture aimed at restoring foreign markets and developing new outlets at home. proniction of world trade must be on a basis of fair competition. we support the principle of bona fide farmer- owned, farmer-operated co-operatives and urge the further development of rural electrification and communication, with federallv-assisted production of power and facilities for distribution when these are not adequately available through private enterprise at fair rates. we insist that an adequate supply .: manpower on the farm is necessary to our national welfare and security and shall do those things required to assure this result. the republican party will create conditions providing for farm prosperity and stability, safe- guarding the farmers’ independence and opening opportunities for young people in rural communi- ties. we will do those things necessary to sim- plify and make efficient the operation of the department of agriculture, prevent that depart- ment from assuming powers neither intended nor delegated by congress, and to place the adminis- tration of farm programs as closely as possible to state and local levels. lasor the republican party believes that regular and adequate income for the employee together with uninterrupted production of goods and services, through the medium of private enterprise, are essential to a sound national economy. this can only be obtained in an era of industrial peace. with the above in mind, we favor the retention of the taft-hartley act, which guarantees: to the working man:— the right to quit his job at any time. the right to take part in legal union activi- ties. the right to remain in his union so long as he pays his dues. the right to protection against unfair prac- tices by either employer or union officials. the right to political activity of his own choice and freedom to contribute thereto. the right to a job without first joining a union. the right to a seerct ballot in any election concerned with his livelihood. the right to protection from personal finan- cial responsibility in damage cases against his union. to the labor unions: the right to establish “union shop” contracts by agreement with management. the right to strike. the right to free collective bargaining. the right to protection from rival unions during the life of union contracts. the right to assurance from employers that they will bargain only with certified unions as a protection against unfair labor practices. we urge the adoption of such amendments to the taft-hartley act as time and experience show to be desirable, and which further protect the rights of labor, management and the public. we condemn the president’s seizure of plants and industries to force the settlement of labor disputes by claims of inherent constitutional powers. natturnat resources we vigorously advocate a full and orderly pro- gram for the development and conservation of our natural resources. we deplore the policies of the present ad- ministration which allow special premiums to foreign producers of minerals available in the united states. we favor reasonable depletion allowances, defense procurement policies, syn- thetic fuels research, and public land policies, including good-faith administration of our mining laws, which will encourage exploration and de- velopment of our mineral resources consistent with our growing industrial and defense needs. we favor stockpiling of strategic and critical raw materials and special premium incentives for their domestic exploration and development. we favor restoration to the states of their rights to all lands and resources beneath navigable in- land and offshore waters within their historic boundaries. we favor protection of our fisheries by domestic regulation and treaties, including safeguards against unfair foreign competition. pesric works axp water policy the federal government and state and local governments should continuously plan programs ot economically justifiable public works. we favor continuous and comprehensive investi- gations of our water resources and orderly execu- tion cf programs approved by the congress. au- thorized water projects should go forward pro- gressively with immediate priority tor those with defense significance, those in critical flood and water-shortage areas, and those substantially com- pleted. we favor greater local participation in the operation and control, and eventual local owner- ship. of federally-sponsored, reimbursable water projects. we vigorously oppose the efforts of this national administration, in california and elsewhere, to undermine state control over water use, to acquire paramount water rights without just compensation, and to establish all-powerful federal socialistic valley authorities. pusric lanps we favor restoration of the traditional republi- can public land policy, which provided oppor- tunity for ownership by citizens to promote the highest land use. we favor an impartial study of tax-free federal lands and their uses to determine their effects on the economic and fiscal structures of our states and local communities. in the management of public lands and forests we pledge the elimination of arbitrary bureau- cratic practices. to this end we favor legislation to define the rights and privileges of grazers and other cooperators and users, to provide the pro- tection of independent judicial review against ad- ministrative invasions of those rights and privi- leges, and to protect the public against corrupt or monopolistic exploitation and bureaucratic favoritism. veterans we believe that active duty in the armed forces of the united states of america during a state of war or national emergency constitutes a special service to our nation, and entitles those campaign of who have so served to aid and compensation in return for this service. consequently we propose: that the aid and compensation given to veterans of previous wars be extended to vet- erans of the korcan conflict; that compensation be fairly and adequately adjusted ta meet changes in the cost of living: that aid be given to veterans, particularly disabled veterans, to obtain suitable emplov- ment, by providing training and education. and through strict compliance with veterans’ prefer- ence laws in federal service; that the veterans’ administration be main- tained as a single, independent agency in full charge of all veterans’ affairs, and that the veterans’ administration manage veterans’ af- fairs in an efficient, prompt and uniform man- ner: that the veterans’ administration should be equipped to provide and maintain medica! and hospital care of the highest possible standard for all eligible veterans. social security inflation has already cut in half the purchasing power of the retirement and other benefits under the federal old age and survivors insurance system. sixty million persons are covered under the system and four and one-half million are now receiving benefits. the best assurance of preserving the benefits for which the worker has paid is to stop the infla- tion which causes the tragic loss of purchasing power, and that we propose to do. we favor amendment of the old age and sur- vivors insurance system to provide coverage for those justly entitled to it but who are now ex- cluded. we shall work to achieve a simple, more effec- tive and more economical method of administra- tion. we shall make a thorough study of universal pay-as-we-go pension plans. health we recognize that the health of our people as well as their proper medical care cannot be main- tained if subject to federal bureaucratic dictation. there should be a division of responsibility be- national party platforms tween government, the physician, the voluntary hospital. and voluntary health insurance. we are opposed to federal compulsory health insurance with its crushing cost, wasteful inefficiency, bu- reaucratic dead weight. and debased standards of medical care. we shall support those health ac- tivittes by government which stimulate the de- velopment of adequate hospital services without federal interference in local administration. we favor support of scientific research. we pledge our continuous encouragement of improved meth- ods of assuring health protection. education the tradition of popular education, tax-sup- ported and free to all, is strong with our people. the responsibility for sustaining this system of popular education has always rested upon the local communities and the states. we subscribe fully to this principle. civic ricuts we condemn bigots who inject class, racial and religious prejudice into public and political mat- ters. bigotry is un-american and a danger to the republic. we deplore the duplicity and insincerity of the party in power in racial and religious matters. al- though they have been in office as a majority party for many years, they have not kept nor do they intend to keep their promises. the republican party will not mislead, exploit or attempt to confuse minority groups for political purposes. all american citizens are entitled to full, impartial enforcement of federal laws re- lating to their civil rights. we believe that it is the primary responsibility of each state to order and control its own do- mestic institutions, and this power, reserved to the states. is essential to the maintenance of our fed- eral republic. however, we believe that the federal government should take supplemental action within its constitutional jurisdiction to oppose discrimination against race, religion or national origin. . we will prove our good faith by: appointing qualified persons, without distinc- tion of race, religion or national origin, to responsible positions in the government. federal action toward the elimination of lynching. federal action toward the elimination of poll taxes as a prerequisite to voting. appropriate action to end segregation in the district of columbia. enacting federal legislation to further just and equitable treatment in the area of discrimi- natory employment practices. federal action should not duplicate state efforts tu end such practices: should not set up another huge bu- reaucracy. censorship we pledge not to infringe by censorship or gag- order the right of a free people to know what their government is doing. eevar richts we recommend to congress the submission of a constitutional amendment providing equal rights for men and women. we favor legislation assuring equal pay for equal work regardless of sex. statehood we favor immediate statehood for hawaii. we favor statehood for alaska under an equita- ble enabling act. we favor eventual statehood for puerto rico. district of columbia we favor self-government and national suffrage for the residents of the nation’s capital. indian affairs all indians are citizens of the united states and no longer should be denied full enjovment of their rights of citizenship. we shall eliminate the existing shameful waste by the bureau of indian affairs which has ob- structed the accomplishment of our national responsibility for improving the condition of our indian friends. we pledge to undertake programs to provide the indians with equal opportunities for education, health protection and economic development. the next republican administration will wel- come the advice and counsel of indian leaders in selecting the indian commissioner. civit service we condemn the flagrant violations of the civil service merit system by the party in power. we favor a personnel program for the federal career service comparable to the best practices of progressive private employers. federal employees shall be selected under a strengthened and ex- tended merit system. civil servants of ability and integrity shall receive proper recognition, with merit the sole test for promotion. delivery of mail we pledge a more efficient and frequent mail delivery service. government reorganization we pledge a thorough reorganization of the federal government in accordance with the prin- ciples set forth in the report of the hoover com- mission which was established by the republican 80th congress. we denounce the duplicity in submitting to congress for approval, reorganization plans which were represented as being in accordance with the principles of the hoover commission recommen- dations, but which in fact were actually intended to further partisan political purposes of the ad- ministration in power. corruption the present administration’s sordid record of corruption has shocked and sickened the american people. its leaders have forfeited any right to public faith by the way they transact the federal government’s business. fraud, bribery, graft, favoritism and infuence- peddling have come to light. immorality and un- ethical behavior have been found to exist among some who were entrusted with high policy-making positions, and there have been disclosures of close alliances between the present government and underworld characters. republicans exposed cases of questionable and criminal conduct and relentlessly pressed for full investigations into the cancer-like spread of cor- ruption in the administration. these investiga- tions uncovered a double standard in federal tax law enforcement—lenient treatment to political favorites including even some gangsters and crooks, but harassment and threats of prosecution for many honest taxpayers over minor discrepan- cies. besides tax fixes and scandals in the internal revenue bureau, investigations have disclosed campaign of links between high officials and crime, favoritism and influence in the rfc, profiteering in grain, sale of postmasterships, tanker-ship deals in the maritime commission, ballot-box stuffing and thievery, and bribes and pay-offs in contract awards by officials in agencies exercising ex- traordinary powers and disbursing billions of dollars. under public pressure, the administration took reluctant steps to clean house. but it was so eager to cover up and block more revelations that its clean-up drive launched with much fanfare ended in a farce. the republican party pledges to put an end to corruption, to oust the crooks and grafters, to administer tax laws fairly and impartially, and to restore honest government to the people. republican 80th congress the republican party does not rest its case upon promises alone. we have a record of per- formance which was grossly defamed by the party in power. the republican 80th congress launched the program to stop communism; unified the armed services; authorized a -group air force which the president blocked; enacted a national service law; balanced the budget; accumulated an eight-billion-dollar surplus; reduced taxes, with per cent of the tax savings to those with in- comes under $,; freed ,, wage earn- ers in the lower brackets from having to pay any further income tax at all, allowed married couples to divide their incomes for tax purposes, and granted an additional $ exemption to those over years of age and to the blind; enacted the taft-hartley law for equitable labor-manage- ment relations; passed the first long-range agri- culture program; increased social security bene- fits; and carried out every single pledge they made to the voters in the election. conclusion upon this statement of truths and this pledge of performance, the republican party stands confi- dent that it expresses the hopes of the citizens of america and certain that it points out with in- tegrity a road upon which free men may march into a new day—a new and better day—in which shall be fulfilled the decent aspirations of our people for peace, for solvency and for the fulfill- ment of our best welfare, under the guidance of divine providence.","['ewer', 'national', 'party', 'platforms', 'plore', 'however', 'widespread', 'current', 'abuses', 'privileges',

Democratic Party,1956,1950,dem_1956.pdf,PDF,"CAMPAIGN OF 1956

In August, 1956, the Democrats renominated
their titular leader, Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois,
for the presidency on the first ballot. Senator Estes
Kefauver of Tennessee was chosen .as the vice-
presidential candidate in a distinctive open con-
test—on the second ballot and over twelve other
candidates including Senator John F. Kennedy of
Massachusetts. Later in the month the Republi-
cans also renominated their 1952 candidates, in-
cumbent President Dwight D. Eisenhower and
Vice-President Richard M. Nixon.

The principal third parties in 1956 were the
Prohibition Party, represented by Enoch Arden
Holtwick of Illinois and Edward M. Cooper of
California; the Socialist Party, for which Darling-
ton Hoopes and Samuel H. Friedman again were
the candidates; and the Socialist Labor Party, with
Eric Hass again the presidential candidate and
Georgia Cozzini of Wisconsin the vice-presidential
candidate. Farrell Dobbs and Myra Tanner Weiss
again made up the Socialist Workers Party ticket.
In mid-September, 317 delegates from several
splinter groups representing voters in approxi-

mately half of the states gathered in Memphis, -

Tennessee, to form a “National Conservative
Movement.” Although the delegates supported the
independent candidacy of T. Coleman Andrews of
Virginia for president and Thomas H. Werdel of
California for vice-president, they voted against
the formation of a third party and published only
a declaration of principles instead of a platform.
The Progressive Party of 1948 and 1952 did not
offer a candidate in 1956, but some minor parties
were established in individual states.

In the election, Eisenhower increased his ma-
jority by nearly 3 million votes over his 1952
figure. The Republicans polled 35,585,245 votes
to 26,030,172 for the Democrats. T. Coleman An-
drews received 108,055 votes, and the Socialist
Labor Party got 44,300. The Prohibition Party at-
tracted 41,937 votes, and the Socialist Workers
obtained 7,797. Darlington Hoopes, for the So-
cialists, had 2,044 votes cast for him.

President Eisenhower received 457 electoral
votes to 73 for Governor Stevenson and 1 for Wal-
ter Jones, an Alabama judge.

Democratic Platform 1956

PREAMBLE

In the brief space of three and one-half years,
the people of the United States have come to
realize, with tragic consequences, that our
National Government cannot be trusted to the
hands of political amateurs, dominated by repre-
sentatives of special privilege.

Four years ago they were beguiled, by empty
promises and pledges, to elect as President a
recent convert to Republicanism. Our people
have now learned that the party of Lincoln has
been made captive to big businessmen with small
minds. They have found that they are now ruled
_ by a Government which they did not elect, and
to which they have not given their consent. Their
awareness of this fact was demonstrated in 1954
when they returned control of the legislative
machinery of the Federal Government to the 84th
Democratic Congress.

From the wreckage of American world leader-
ship under a Republican Administration, this great

Democratic Congress has salvaged a portion of
the world prestige our Nation enjoyed under the
brilliant Administrations of Franklin Delano
Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman.

Our Democratic 84th Congress made one of
the greatest legislative records in the history
of our country. It enacted an active program of
progressive, humane legislation, which has re-
pudiated the efforts of reactionary Republicanism
to stall America’s progress. When we return to
the halls of Congress next January, and with a
Democratic President in the White House, it will
be the plan and purpose of our Party to complete

‘restoration and rehabilitation of American leader-
ship in world affairs. We pledge return of our -

National Government to its rightful owners, the
people of the United States.

On the threshold of an atomic age, in mid-
Twentieth Century, our beloved Nation needs the

vision, vigor and vitality which can be infused

into it only by a government under the Demo-
cratic Party.
We approach the forthcoming election with

523


524 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

a firm purpose of effecting such infusion; and
with the help and assistance of Divine Providence

we shall endeavor to accomplish it. To the end—

that the people it has served so well may know
our program for the return of America to the
highway of progress, the Democratic ‘Party
herewith submits its platform for 1956.

I. ForeicN Poticy AND NATIONAL DEFENSE

The Democratic Party affirms that world peace
is a primary objective of human society. Peace is
more than a suspension of shooting while frenzied
and fearful nations stockpile armaments of annihi-
lation.

Achievement of world peace requires political
statesmanship and economic wisdom, international
understanding and dynamic leadership. True
peace is the tranquillity of ordered justice on a
global scale. It may be destroyed without a shot
being fired. It can be fostered and preserved only
by the solid unity and common brotherhood of

the peoples of the world in the cause of freedom.
_ The hopes and aspirations of the peoples of all
nations for justice and peace depend largely upon
the courageous and enlightened administration
of the foreign and defense policies of the United
States. We deplore the fact that the administra-
tion of both policies since 1953 has confused
timidity with courage, and blindness with en-
lightenment.

The Republican Record of Confusion and
Complacency Is the President's Responsibility.
The world’s hopes for lasting peace depend upon
the conduct of our foreign policy, a function
which the Constitution vests in the President
of the United States and one which has not been
effectively exercised by, President Eisenhower.
Since 1953, responsibility for foreign affairs has
been President Eisenhower's, his alone, and his
in full.

In the past three years, his conduct of our
policies has moved us into realms where we risk
grave danger. He has failed to seek peace with
determination, for his disarmament policy has
failed to strike hard at the institution of war. His
handling of the day-by-day problems of inter-
national affairs has unnecessarily and dangerously
subjected the American people to the risk of
atomic world war. .

Our Government Lacks Leadership. We need
bold leadership, yet in the three years since
Stalin’s death, in the full year since President

Eisenhower's meeting at the “summit,” the Re-
publican Administration has not offered a single
concrete new idea to meet the new-style political
and economic offensive of the Soviets, which
represents, potentially, an even graver challenge
than Stalin’s use of force. President Eisenhower
and his Secretary of State talk at cross-purposes,
praising neutralism one day, condemning it the

next.. The Republicans ‘seem unable either to

make up their minds or to give us leadership,
while the unity of the free world rapidly dis-
integrates.

We in America need to make our peaceful pur-
pose clear beyond dispute in every corner of the
world—yet Secretary Dulles brags of “brinks of
war.” We need a foreign policy which rises above
jockeying for partisan position or advantage—yet,
not in memory has there been so little bipartisan-
ship in the administration of our policies, so little
candor in their presentation to our people, so much
pretending that things are better than they are.

The Republican Bluster and Bluff. Four years
ago the Republican Party boasted of being able to
produce a foreign policy which was to free the
Communist satellites, unleash Chiang Kai-shek,
repudiate the wartime agreements, and reverse
the policy of containing Communist expansion.

Since 1953 they have done just the opposite,
standing silent when the peoples rise in East
Germany and Poland, and thereby weakening the
positive Democratic policy of halting Communist
expansion.

Our Friends Lose Faith In Us. Our friends
abroad. now doubt our sincerity. They have seen
the solid assurance of collective security under a
Democratic Administration give place to the un-
certainties of personal diplomacy. They have
seen the ties of our international alliances and
friendship weakened by inept Republican ma-

.neuvering. :

They have seen traditional action and boldness
in foreign affairs evaporate into Republican
complacency, retrenchment and empty posturing.

The Failure Abroad. Blustering without dy-
namic action will not alter the fact that. the unity
and strength of the free world have been drasti-
cally impaired. Witness the decline of NATO,
the bitter tragedy of Cyprus, the withdrawal of
French forces to North Africa, the uncertainty
and dangers in the Middle East, an uncertain and
insecure Germany, and resentment rising against
United States leadership everywhere.


In Asia—in Burma, Ceylon, Indonesia, India—
anti-Americanism grows apace, aggravated by
the clumsy actions of our Government, and fanned
by the inept utterances of our “statesmen.”

In the Middle East, the Eisenhower Adminis-
tration has dawdled and drifted. The results have
been disastrous, and worse threatens. Only the
good offices of the United Nations in maintain-
ing peace between Israel and her neighbors
conceal the diplomatic incapacities of the Re-
publican Administration. The current crisis over
Suez is a consequence of inept and vacillating
Republican policy. Our Government’s mistakes
have placed us in a position in the Middle East
which threatens the free world with a loss of
power and prestige, potentially more dangerous
than any we have suffered in the past decade.

The Failure at Home. Political considerations of
budget balancing and tax reduction now come
before the wants of our national security and the
needs of our Allies. The Republicans have slashed
our own armed strength, weakened our capacity
to deal with military threats, stifled our air force,
starved our army and weakened our capacity to
deal with aggression of any sort save by retreat
or by the alternatives, “massive retaliation” and
global atomic war. Yet, while our troubles mount,
they tell us our prestige was never higher, they
tell us we were never more secure.

The Challenge Is For Democracy to Meet. The
Democratic Party believes that “waging peace” is
a monumental task to be performed honestly,
forthrightly, with dedication and consistent effort.

The way to lasting peace is to forego bluster
and bluff, to regain steadiness of purpose, to join
again in faithful concert with the community of
free nations, to look realistically at the challenging
circumstances which confront us, to face them
candidly and imaginatively, and to return to the
Democratic policy of peace through strength.

This is a task for Democrats. This facing of
new problems, this rising to new challenges, has
been our Party’s mission and its glory for three
generations past. President Truman met and
mastered Stalin’s challenge a decade’ ago, with
boldness, courage and imagination, and so will
we turn to the challenge before us now, pressing
the search for real and lasting peace. TO THIS
WE PLEDGE:

Support for the United Nations. The United
‘Nations is indispensable for the maintenance of
world peace and for the settlement of contro-

CAMPAIGN OF 1956 525

versies between nations small and large. We
pledge our every effort to strengthen its usefulness
and expand its role as guide and guardian of
international security and peace. We deplore the
Republicans’ tendency to use the United Nations
only. when it suits them, ignoring or by passing

‘it whenever they please.

We pledge determined opposition to the ad-
mission of the Communist Chinese into the
United Nations. They have proven their com-
plete hostility to the purposes of this organiza-
tion. We pledge continued support to National-
ist China. ,

Release of American Prisoners. We urge a
continuing effort to effect the release of all
Americans detained by Communist China.

Support for Effective Disarmament. In_ this
atomic age, war threatens the very survival of
civilization. To eliminate the danger of atomic
war, a universal, effective and enforced disarma-
ment system must be the goal of responsible men
and women everywhere. So long as we lack en-
forceable international control of weapons, we
must maintain armed strength to avoid war. But
technological advances in the field of nuclear
weapons make disarmament an ever more urgent
problem. Time and distance can never again pro-
tect any nation of the world. The Eisenhower
Administration, despite its highly publicized pro-
posals for aerial inspection, has made no progress
toward this great objective. We pledge the
Democratic Party to pursue vigorously this great
goal of enforced disarmament in full awareness
that irreparable injury, even total destruction, now
threatens the human race.

Adequate Defense Forces. We reject the false
Republican notion that this country can afford
only a second-best defense. We stand for strong
defense forces so clearly superior in modern
weapons to those of any possible enemy that our
armed strength will make an attack upon the
free world unthinkable, and thus be a major force
for world peace. The Republican Administration
stands indicted for failing to recognize the
necessity of proper living standards for the
men and women of our armed forces and their
families. We. pledge ourselves to the better-
ment of the living conditions of the members. of
our armed services, and to a needed increase in
the so-called “fringe benefits.”

Training for Defense. The Democratic Party
pledges itself to a bold and imaginative program


526 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

devised to utilize fully the: brain power of
America’s youth,, including its talent in the
scientific and technical fields.

Scholarships and loan assistance and such other
steps as may be determined desirable must be
employed to secure this objective. This is solely
in the interest of necessary and adequate national
defense.

Strengthening Civil Defense. We believe that
a strong, effective civil defense is a necessary part
of national defense. Advances in nuclear weapons
have made existing civil defense legislation and
practices obsolete.

We pledge ourselves to establish a real program
for protecting the civilian population and industry
of our Nation in place of the present weak and
ineffective program. We believe that this is
essentially a Federal responsibility. _

Collective Security Arrangements. The Demo-
cratic Party inaugurated and we strongly favor
collective defense arrangements, such as NATO
and the Organization of American States, within
the framework of the United Nations. We realize,
as the Republicans have not, that mutually recog-
nized common interests can be flexibly adapted
to the varied needs and aspirations of all countries
concerned.

Winning the Productivity Race. The Republi-
can Party has not grasped one of the dominant
facts of mid-century—that the growth of pro-
ductive power of the Communist states presents a
challenge which cannot be-evaded. The Demo-
cratic Party is confident that, through the freedom
we enjoy, a vast increase in productive power of
our Nation and our Allies will be achieved, and
by their combined capacity they will surmount
any challenge.

Economic Development Abroad. We believe
that, in the cause of peace, America must support
the efforts of underdeveloped countries on a co-
operative basis to organize their own resources
and to increase their own economic productivity,
so that they may enjoy the higher living standards
which science and modern industry make possible.
We will give renewed strength to programs of
economic and technical assistance. We support
a multilateral approach to these programs, where-
ever possible, so that burdens are shared and
resources pooled among all the economically de-
veloped countries with the capital and: skills to
help in this great task.

Further, while recognizing the relation of our

national security to the role of the United States
in international affairs, the Democratic Party
believes the time has come for a realistic re-
appraisal of the American foreign aid program,
particularly as to its extent and the conditions
under which it should be continued. This re-
appraisal will determine the standards by which
further aid shall be granted, keeping in mind
America’s prime objective of securing world peace.

Bringing the Truth to the World. The tools of
truth and candor are even more important than
economic tools. The Democratic Party believes
that once our Government is purged of the con-

fusion and complacency fostered by the Re-

publican Administration.a new image of America
will emerge in the world: the image of a confident
America dedicated to its traditional principles,
eager to work with other peoples, honest in its
pronouncements, and consistent in its policies.
Freedom for Captive Nations. We condemn
the Republican Administration for its heartless
record of broken promises to the unfortunate
victims of Communism. Candidate Eisenhower's
1952 pledges to “liberate” the captive peoples

‘have been disavowed and dishonored.

We declare our deepest concern for the plight
of the freedom-loving peoples of Central and
Eastern Europe and of Asia, now under the yoke
of Soviet dictatorship. The United States, under
Democratic leaders, has never recognized the
forcible annexation of Lithuania, Latvia, and
Estonia, or condoned the extension of the Krem-
lin’s tyranny over Poland, Bulgaria, Rumania,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Albania and other
countries. ‘

We look forward to the day when the
liberties of all captive nations will be restored to
them and they can again take their rightful place
in the community of free nations.

We shall press before the United Nations the
principle that Soviet Russia withdraw its troops
from the captive countries, so as to permit free,
fair and unfettered elections in the subjugated
areas, in compliance with the Atlantic Charter
and other binding commitments.

Upholding the Principle of Self-Determination.

We rededicate ourselves to. the high principle of |

national self-determination, as enunciated by
Woodrow Wilson, whose: leadership brought
freedom and independence to uncounted millions.

It is the policy of the Democratic Party, there-
fore, to encourage and assist small nations and all


peoples, behind the Iron Curtain and outside, in
the peaceful and orderly achievement of their
legitimate aspirations toward political, geographi-
cal, and ethnic integrity, so that they may dwell
in the family of sovereign nations with freedom
and dignity. We are opposed to colonialism and
Communist imperialism.

We shall endeavor to apply this principle to
the desires of all peoples for self-determination.

Reciprocal Trade Among the Nations. The
Democratic Party has always worked for ex-
panding trade among free nations. Expanding
world trade is necessary not only for our friends,
but for ourselves; it is the way to meet America’s
. growing need for industrial raw materials. We
shall continue to support vigorously the Hull
Reciprocal Trade Program.

Under Democratic Administrations, the opera-
tion of this Act was conducted in a manner that
recognized equities for agriculture, industry and
labor. Under the present Republican Administra-
tion, there has been a most flagrant disregard
of these important segments of our economy
resulting in serious economic injury to hundreds
of thousands of Americans engaged in these
pursuits. We pledge correction of these con-
ditions.

Encouraging European Unity. Through the
Marshall Plan, the European Economic Organiza-
tion and NATO, the Democratic Party encouraged
and supported efforts to achieve greater economic
and political unity among the free nations of
Europe, and to increase the solidarity of the
nations of the North Atlantic community. We
will continue those efforts, taking into account the
viewpoints and aspirations of different sectors of
the European community, particularly in regard
to practical proposals for the unification of Ger-
many. _

‘Peace and Justice in the Middle East. The
Democratic Party stands for the maintenance of
peace in the Middle East, which is essential to
the well-being and progress of all its peoples.

We will urge Israel and the Arab States to
settle their differences by peaceful means, and to
maintain the sanctity of the Holy Places in the
_ Holy Land and permit free access to them.

We will assist Israel to build a sound and viable
economy for her people, so that she may fulfill
her humanitarian mission of providing shelter and
sanctuary for her homeless Jewish refugees while
strengthening her national development.

CAMPAIGN OF 1956 527

We will assist the Arab States to develop their
economic resources and raise the living standards
of their people. The plight of the Arab refugees
commands our continuing sympathy and concem.
We will assist in carrying out large-scale projects
for their resettlement in countries where there is
room and opportunity for them.

We support the principle of free access to the
Suez Canal under suitable international auspices.
The present policies of the Eisenhower Ad-
ministration in the Middle East are unnecessarily
increasing the risk that war will break out in this
area. To prevent war, to ‘assure peace, we will
faithfully carry out our country’s pledge under
the Tripartite Declaration of 1950 to oppose the
use or threat of force and to take such action as
may be necessary in the interest of peace, both
within and outside the United Nations, to prevent
any violation of the frontiers of any armistice
lines.

The Democratic Party will act to redress the
dangerous imbalance of arms in the area resulting
from the shipment of Communist arms to Egypt,
by selling or supplying defensive weapons to
Israel, and will take such steps, including security
guarantees, as may be required to deter aggression
and war in the area.

We oppose, as contrary to American principles,
the practice of any government which discrimi-
nates against American citizens on grounds of
race or religion. We will not countenance any
arrangement or treaty with any government
which by its terms or in its practical application
would sanction such practices.

Support for Free Asia. The people of Asia seek
a new and freer life and they are in a com-
mendable hurry to get it. They struggle against
poverty, ill health and illiteracy. In the aftermath
of war, China became a victim of Communist
tyranny. But many new free nations have arisen
in South and Southeast Asia. South Korea remains
free, and the new Japan has abandoned her
former imperial and aggressive ways. America’s
task and interest in Asia is to help the govern-
ments of free peoples demonstrate that they
have improved living standards without yielding
to Communist tyranny or domination by anyone.
That task will be carried out under Democratic
leadership.

Support of Our Good Neighbors to the South.
In the Western Hemisphere the Democratic
Party will restore the policy of the “good neigh-


528 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

bor” which has been alternately neglected and
abused by the Republican Administration. We
pledge ourselves to fortify the defenses of the
Americas, In this respect, we will intensify our
cooperation with our neighboring republics to
help them strengthen their economies, improve
educational opportunities, and combat disease. We
will strive to make the Western Hemisphere an
inspiring example of what free peoples working
together can accomplish.

Progressive Immigration Policies. | America’s
jong tradition of hospitality and asylum for those
seeking freedom, opportunity, and -escape from
oppression, has been besmirched by the delays,
failures and broken promises of the Republican
Administration. _The Democratic Party favors
prompt revision of the immigration and nationality
laws to eliminate unfair provisions under which
admissions to this country depend upon quotas
based upon the accident of national origin. Proper
safeguards against subversive elements should be
provided. Our immigration procedures must re-
flect the principles of our Bill of Rights.

We favor eliminating the provisions of law
which charge displaced persons admitted to our
shores against quotas for future years. Through
such “mortgages” of future quotas, thousands of
qualified persons. are being forced to wait long
years before they can hope for admission. |

We also favor more liberal admission of rela-
tives to eliminate the unnecessary: tragedies of
broken families.

We favor elimination of unnecessary distinc-
tions between native-born and naturalized citizens.
There should be no “second class” citizenship in
the United States.

The administration of the Refugee Relief Act of
1953 has been a disgrace to our country. Rescue
has been denied to innocent, defenseless and
suffering people, the victims of war and the
aftermath of wars. The purpose of the Act has
been defeated by Republican mismanagement.

Victims of Communist Oppression. We will
continue to support programs providing succor
for escapees from behind the Iron Curtain, and
bringing help to the victims of war and Com-
munist oppression. , ;

. The Challenge of the Next Four Years. Today
new challenges call for new ideas and new
methods.

In the coming years, our great necessity will
be to pull together as a people, with true non-

partisanship in foreign affairs under leaders in-
formed, courageous and responsible.

We shall need: to work closely with each other
as Americans. If we here indict the Republican
record, we acknowledge gratefully the efforts of

individual Republicans to achieve true bipartisan- -

ship. In this spirit an affirmative, cooperative
policy can be developed. We shall need to work
closely, also, with others all around ‘the world.
For there is much to do—to create once more
the will and the power to transform the principles
of the United Nations into a living reality; to

awaken ourselves and others to the effort and -

sacrifice which alone can win justice and peace:

II. THe Domestic Poticy—Tue REPUBLICAN
REACTION TO 20 YEARS OF PROGRESS

The Democratic Bequest. Twenty years of
vivid Democratic accomplishments revived and
reinforced our economic system, and. wrote
humanity upon the statute books. All this, the
current Republican Administration inherited.

The Republican Brand of Prosperity. Substi-
tuting deceptive slogans and dismal deeds for the
Democratic program, the Republicans have been
telling the American people that “we are now
more prosperous than ever before in peacetime.”
For the American farmer, the small. businessman
and the low-income worker, the old people living
on a pittance, the young people seeking an
American standard of education, and the minority
groups seeking full employment opportunity at
adequate wages, this tall tale of Republican pros-
perity has been an illusion.

The evil is slowly but surely infiltrating the
entire economic system. Its fever signs are evi-
denced by soaring monopoly profits, while wages
lag, farm income collapses, and small-business
failures multiply at an alarming rate.

The first time-bomb of the Republican crusade
against full prosperity for all was the hard-money
policy. This has increased the debt burden on
depressed farms, saddled heavier costs on small
business, foisted higher interest charges on
millions of homeowners (including veterans),
pushed up unnecessarily the cost of. consumer
credit, and swelled the inordinate profits of a few
lenders of money. It has wrought havoc with the
bond market, with resulting financial loss to the
ordinary owners of .Government bonds.

The Republican tax policy has joined hands
in an unholy alliance with the hard-money policy.

{


Fantastic misrepresentation of the Government's
budgetary position has been used to deny tax
relicf to low- and middle-income families, while

tax concessions and handouts have been gener- .

ously sprinkled among potential campaign con-
tributors to Republican coffers. The disastrously
reactionary farm program, the hardhearted re-
sistance to adequate expansion of Social Security
and other programs for human well-being, and
favoritism in the award of Government contracts,
all have watered the economic tree at the top and
neglected its roots.

The Stunting of Our Economic Progress. The
Republicans say that employment and production
are “higher” than ever before. The fact is that
our over-all rate of growth has been crippled and
stunted in contrast to its faster increase during
the Democratic years from 1947 to 1953, after
World War II.

With production lagging behind full capacity,
unemployment has grown.

The Republican claim that this stunted pros-
perity is the price of peace is a distortion.
National-security outlays have averaged a higher
part of our total production during these Re-
publican years than during 1947-58, and yet the
annual growth in total production during these
Republican years has been only about 60 percent
as fast as in the preceding Democratic years. The
progress of low-income families toward an
American standard of living, rapid during the
Democratic years, has ground to a stop under the
Republicans.

Federal budgetary outlays for education and
health, old-age assistance and child care, slum
clearance and resource development, and _ all
the other great needs of our people have been
mercilessly slashed from an annual rate of more
than $57 per capita under the Democrats to $33
per capita under the Republicans,.a cut of 42
percent.

The Failure of the Republican Budget-Bal-
ancers. During the Republican fiscal years 1954-
1957 as a whole, the deficits have averaged
larger, and the surpluses smaller, than during the
Democratic fiscal years 1947-1953, financial
manipulation to the contrary notwithstanding.
’ Democratic Principles for Full Prosperity for
All:

(1) We repudiate the Republican stunting of
our economic growth, and we reassert. the princi-
ples of the Full Employment Act of 1946;

CAMPAIGN OF 1956 529

(2) We pledge ourselves to achieve an honest
and realistic balance of the Federal Budget in a

“just and fully prosperous American economy;

(3) We pledge ourselves to equitable tax re-
visions and monetary policies designed to combine
economic progress with economic justice. We
condemn the Republican use of our revenue and
money systems to benefit the few at the expense
of the vast majority of our people;

(4) We pledge ourselves to work toward the
reduction and elimination of poverty in America;

(5) We pledge ourselves to full parity of in-
come and living standards for agriculture; to
strike off the shackles which the Taft-Hartley law
has unjustly imposed on labor; and to foster the
more rapid growth of legitimate business enter-
prise by founding this growth upon the expanding
consuming power.of the people; and

(6) We pledge ourselves to expand world trade
and to enlarge international economic coopera-
tion, all toward the end of a more prosperous and
more peaceful world.

Democratic Goals To Be Achieved During Four
Years of Progress. By adhering to these prin-
ciples, we shall strive to attain by 1960 the fol-
lowing full prosperity objectives for all American
families:

(1) A 500 billion dollar national economy in
rea] terms;

(2) An increase of 20 percent or better in
the average standard of living;

(8) An increase in the annual income of
American families, with special emphasis on those
whose incomes are below $2000;

(4) A determined drive toward parity of in-
comes and living standards for those engaged in
the vital pursuit of agriculture;

(5). The addition of all necessary classrooms
for our primary and secondary schools; the con-
struction of needed new homes, with a proper
proportion devoted to the rehousing of low- and
middle-income families in urban and rural areas;
the increase of benefits under the Old Age Assist-
ance and Old Age Survivors Insurance Pro-
grams; a substantial expansion in hospital facilities
and medical research; and a doubling of our pro-
grams for resource development and conservation;
and

(6) National defense outlays based upon our
national needs, not permitting false economy to
jeopardize our very survival.

This country of ours, in the factory, in business


530 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

and on the farm, is blessed with ever-increasing
productive power. The Republicans have not per-
mitted this potential abundance to be released
for the mutual benefit of all. We reject this stunted
Republican concept of America. We pledge our-
selves to release the springs of abundance, to
bring this abundance to all, and thus to fulfill the
full promise of America.

These are our Democratic goals for the next
four years. We set them forth in vivid contrast
to Republican lip-service protestations that they,
too, are for these goals. Their little deeds belie
their large and hollow slogans. Our performance
in the past gives validity to our goals for. the
future.

Our victory in 1956 will make way for the
commencement of these four years of progress.

Ill. Free ENTERPRISE

“Equal rights for all and special privileges for
none,” the tested Jeffersonian principle, remains
today the only philosophy by which human rights
can be preserved by governnient.

It is a sad fact in the history of the Republican
Party that, under its control, our Government has
always become an instrument of special privilege;
not a government of the people, by the people,
and for the people. We have had, instead, under
Harding, Coolidge and Hoover, and now. under
Eisenhower, government of the many, by the few,
and for the few. .

We recognize monopolies and monopolistic
practices as the real barriers between the people
and their economic and political freedom. Monop-
olies act to stifle equality of opportunity and
prevent the infusion of fresh blood into the life-
stream of our economy. The Republican Ad-
ministration has allowed giant corporate entities
to dominate our economy. For example, forty
thousand automobile dealers now know they were
incapable of coping with these giants. They were,
as the Democratic 84th Congress found, sub-
jected to abuse and threatened with extinction.
The’ result was passage of the O’Mahoney-
Celler bill giving the automobile dealers of
America economic freedom. We enacted this
law, and we pledge that it shall be retained upon
the statute books as a monument to the Demo-
cratic Party’s concern for small business.

We pledge ourselves to the restoration of truly
competitive conditions in American industry.
Affirmative action within the framework of

American tradition will be taken to curb corporate

mergers that would contribute to the growth of
economic concentration.

Small and Independent Business. In contrast
to the maladministration by the Republican Party
of the Federal program to assist small and inde-
pendent business, we pledge ourselves—

(1) To the strict and impartial enforcement
of the laws originally fostered and strengthened
by the Democratic Party and designed to prevent
monopolies. and other concentrations of economic
and financial power; and to enact legislation to
close loopholes in the laws prohibiting price
discrimination;

(2) To tax relief for all small and independent
businesses by fair and equitable adjustments in
Federal taxation which will encourage business
expansion, and to the realistic application of the
principle of graduated taxation to such corporate

‘income. An option should be provided to spread

Federal estate taxes over a period of years when
an estate consists principally of the equity capital
of a closely held small business;

(8) To adoption of all practical means of
making long- and short-term credit available to
small'and independent businessmen at reasonable
rates;

(4) To the award of a substantially higher pro-
portion of Government contracts to independent

small businesses, and to the award of a far larger

percentage of military procurement, by value,
after competitive bids rather than by negotiation
behind closed doors. We severely condemn Re-
publican discrimination against small and inde-
pendent business;

(5) To replacement of the weak and ineffective
Republican conduct of the Small Business Ad-
ministration, and its reconstitution as a vigorous,
independent agency which will advocate the
cause of small and independent businessmen, and
render genuine assistance in fulfilling their needs
and solving their problems. We condemn the
Republican Administration for its failure to serve
this important segment of our economy.

Law Enforcement. We pledge ourselves to the

fair and impartial administration of justice. The
Republican Administration has degraded the

great powers of law enforcement. It has not used
them in the service of equal justice under law,
but for concealment, coercion, persecution, politi-
cal advantage and special interests.

Merchant Marine. In the interest of our na-


tional security, and of the maintenance of
American standards of wages and living, and in
order that our waterborne overseas commerce

shall not be unfairly discriminated against by

_ low-cost foreign competition, we pledge our con-
tinued encouragement and support of a strong and
adequate American Merchant Marine.

Transportation. The public and national de-
fense interests require the development and
maintenance, under the competitive free enter-
prise system, of a strong, efficient and financially
sound system of common-carrier transportation
by water, highway, rail, and air, with each mode
enabled, through sound and intelligent exercise of
regulatory powers, to realize its inherent eco-
nomic advantages and to reflect its full competitive
capabilities. Public interest also requires, under
reasonable standards, the admission of new
licensees, where public convenience may be
served, into the transport fields. We deplore the
lack of enforcement of safety regulations for pro-
tection of life and property under the present
Republican Administration, and pledge strict en-
forcement of such regulations.

Highways. We commend the foresight of the
Democratic 84th Congress for its enactment of
the greatest program in history for expansion of
our highway network, and we congratulate it upon
its rejection of the unsound, unworkable, inade-
quate and unfair roads bill proposed by the

_ present Republican Administration. In coopera-
tion with state and local governments, we. will
continue the programs developed and fostered
under prior Democratic Administrations for plan-
ning, coordinating, financing and encouraging
the expansion of our national road and highway
network so vital to defense and transportation in
the motor age. We support expansion of farm-to-
market roads.

Rivers and Harbors. We pledge continued de-
velopment of harbors and waterways as a vital
segment of our transportation system. We de-
nounce as capricious and arbitrary the Eisen-
hower pocket veto of the 1956 Rivers and Harbors
bill, which heartlessly. deprived the people in
many sections of our country of vitally needed
public works. projects.

IV. A Macna CwHarTa For Lasor

Labor-Management Relations. Harmonious
labor-management relations are productive of
‘good incomes for wage earners and conducive to

CAMPAIGN OF 1956 531

rising output from our factories. We believe that,
to the widest possible extent consistent with the

public interest, management and labor should -

determine wage rates and conditions of employ-
ment through free collective bargaining.

The Taft-Hartley Act passed by the Republi-
can-dominated 80th Congress seriously impaired
this relationship as established in the Wagner
National Labor Relations Act, enacted under the
Roosevelt Administration. The Wagner Act pro-
tected, encouraged and guaranteed the rights of
workers to organize, to join unions of their own
choice, and to bargain collectively through these
unions without coercion.

The vicious anti-union character of the Taft-
Hartley Act was expressly recognized by Candi-
date Eisenhower during the 1952 election cam-
paign. ,

At that time, he made a solemn promise to
eliminate its unjust provisions and to enact a fair
law. President Eisenhower and his Administration
have failed utterly, however, to display any
executive initiative or forcefulness toward keeping
this pledge to the workers. He was further
responsible for administratively amending Taft-
Hartley into a more intensely anti-labor weapon
by stacking the National Labor Relations Board
with biased pro-management personnel who, by
administrative decision, transformed the Act into
a management weapon. One such decision re-
moved millions of workers from the jurisdiction
of the NLRB, which in many cases left them
without protection of either State or Federal legis-
lation. -

We unequivocally advocate repeal of the Taft-
Hartley Act.. The Act must be repealed because
State “right-to-work” laws have their genesis in
its discriminatory anti-labor provisions.

It must be repealed because its restrictive pro-
visions deny the principle that national legislation
based on the commerce clause of the Constitution
normally overrides conflicting State laws.

The Taft-Hartley Act has been proven to be
inadequate, unworkable and unfair. It interferes
in an arbitrary manner with collective bargaining,
causing imbalance in the relationship between
management and labor.

Upon return of our National Government to the
Democratic Party, a new legislative approach
toward the entire labor-management problem will
be adopted, based on past experience and the
principles of the Wagner National Labor Rela-


532 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS""

tions Act and the. Norris-La Guardia Anti-In-
junction Law.

Fair Labor Standards. We commend the action
of the Democratic 84th Congress which raised the
minimum wage from 75 cents to $1.00 an hour
despite the strenuous objection of President
Eisenhower and the Republicans in Congress.
However, the inadequacies of the minimum wage
become apparent as the cost of living increases,
and we feel it imperative to raise the minimum
wage to at least $1.25 an hour, in order to approxi-
mate present-day needs more closely.

We further pledge as a matter of priority to
extend full protection of the Fair Labor Standards
Act to all workers in industry engaged in, or
affecting, interstate commerce.

Walsh-Healey Contracts Act. We pledge re- :

vision and honest administration of the Walsh-
Healey Act, to restore its effectiveness and useful-
Ness as an instrument for maintaining fair stand-
ards of wages and hours for American workers.

Equal Pay for Equal Work. We advocate legis-
lation to provide equal pay for equal work, re-
gardless of sex.

The Physically Handicapped. The Democratic
Party has always supported legislation to benefit
the disabled worker. The physically handicapped
have proved their value to Government and_in-
dustry. We pledge our continued support of
legislation to improve employment opportunities
of physically handicapped persons.

Migratory Workers. We shall support legisla-
tion providing for the protection and improvement
of the general welfare of migratory workers.

Jobs for Depressed Areas. We pledge our Party
to support legislation providing for an effective
program to promote industry and create jobs in
depressed industrial and rural areas so that such
areas may be restored to economic stability.

V. AGRICULTURE

- Sustained national prosperity is dependent
upon a vigorous agricultural economy.

We condemn the defeatist attitude of the
Eisenhower Administration in. refusing .to take
effective action to assure the well-being of farm
families.. We condemn its fear of abundance, its
lack of initiative in developing domestic mar-
kets, and its dismal failure to obtain for the
American farmer his traditional and deserved
share of the world market. Its extravagant ex-

penditure of money intended for agricultural
benefit, without either direction or results, is a
national calamity.

The Eisenhower Administration has failed
utterly to develop any programs to meet the
desperate needs of farmers in the face of fantastic
promises,.and it has sabotaged the progressive
programs inherited from prior Democratic Ad-
ministrations by failing to administer them
properly in the interest either of farmers or of
the Nation as a whole.

Specifically, we denounce President Eisen-
hower’s veto of the constructive legislation pro-
posed and passed by the Democratic 84th Con-
gress to reverse the alarming fall of farm prices
and restore farmers to a position of first-class
economic citizenship in the sharing of benefits
from American productive ability.

We also condemn the Republican Administra-
tion for its abandonment of the true principles of
soil conservation and for its destruction of the
Soil Conservation Service. We pledge to support
continued improvements in the soil bank program
passed by the Democratic 84th Congress and
originally opposed by President Eisenhower and
Secretary Ezra Taft Benson. We deplore the

diversion of this conservation program into a.

direct vote-buying scheme.

Farmers have had to struggle far three: and
one-half years while their net farm income has
fallen more than one billion dollars a year. Their
parity ratio, which under Democratic Adminis-
trations had been 100 percent or more during the
eleven years prior to 1953, dropped to as low as
80 percent during the Eisenhower Administration,
and the farmers’ share of the consumers’ food
dollar shrank from 47 cents in 1952 to as low as
only 38 cents. One stark fact stands out clearly
for all to see—disastrously low farm prices and
record high consumer prices vie with each other
for the attention of responsible government. In a
reduction of this incongruous spread lies the
answer.to some of the most vexing problems of
agricultural economics.

In their courageous fight to save their homes
and land, American farmers have gone deeper
and deeper into debt. Last year farmers’ mortgage
indebtedness increased more than in any year in
history with the exception of the year 1923.

The Democratic Party met similar situations
forthrightly in the past with concrete remedial


action. It takes legitimate pride in its consistent
record of initiating and developing every con-
structive program. designed to protect and con-
serve the human and natural resources so vital to
our rural economy. These programs enabled
consumers. to obtain more abundant supplies of
high-quality food and fiber at reasonable prices
while maintaining adequate income for farmers
and improving the level of family living in rural
areas.

In order to regain the ground lost during the
Eisenhower Administration, and in order better to
serve both consumers and producers, the Demo-
cratic Party pledges continuous and vigorous
support to the following policies:

Sponsor a positive and comprehensive program
to conserve our soil, water and forest resources
for future generations;

Promote programs which will protect and
preserve the family-type farm as a bulwark of
American life, and encourage farm-home owner-
ship, including. additional assistance to family
farmers and young farmers in the form of specially
designed credit and price-support programs,
technical aid, and enlarged soil conservation al-
lowances.

Maintain. adequate reserves of agricultural
commodities strategically situated, for national
‘security purposes. Such stockpiles should be
handled as necessary strategic reserves, so that
farmers will not be penalized by depressed prices
for their efficiency and diligence in producing
abundance;

Promote international exchange of commodities
by creating an International Food Reserve, foster-
ing commodity agreements, and vigorously ad-
ministering the Foreign Agricultural Trade De-
velopment and Assistance Act;

Undertake immediately by appropriate action
to endeavor to regain the full 100 percent of
parity the farmers received under the Democratic
Administrations. We will achieve this by means of
supports on basic commodities at 90 percent of
parity and by means of commodity loans, direct
purchases, direct payments to producers, market-
ing agreements and orders, production adjust-
ments, or a combination of these, including legis-
lation, to bring order and stability into the
relationship between the producer, the processor
and the consumer; ,

Develop practical measures for’ extending price

CAMPAIGN OF 1956 533

supports to feed grains and other nonbasic
storables and to the producers of perishable com-
modities such as meat, poultry, dairy products
and the like;

Inaugurate a-food-stamp or other supplemental
food program administered by appropriate State
or local agencies to insure that no needy family
shall be denied an adequate and wholesome diet
because of low income;

Continue and expand school lunch and special
milk programs to meet the dietary needs of all
school children;

Increase the distribution of food to public
institutions and organizations and qualified private
charitable agencies, and increase the distribution
of food and fiber to needy people in other nations
through recognized charitable and religious
‘channels;

Devise and employ effective means to reduce
the spread between producers’ prices and con-
sumers’ costs, and improve market facilities and
marketing practices;

Expand the program of agricultural research
and education for better distribution, preserva-
tion and marketing of farm products to serve both
producers and consumers, and promote increased
industrial use of farm surpluses;

Provide for an increased reservoir of farm
credit at lower rates, designed purticularly. to
accommodate operators of small family-type
farms, and extend crop insurance to maximum
coverage and protection;

Return the administration of farm programs
to farmer-elected committeemen, eliminate the
deplorable political abuses in Federal employment
in many agricultural counties as practiced by the
Eisenhower Administration, and restore leadership
to the administration of soil conservation districts;

Insure reliable and low-cost rural electric and
telephone service;

Exercise authority in existing law relating to
imports of price-supported agricultural commodi-
ties in raw, manufactured or processed form as
part of our national policy to minimize damage
to our domestic economy;

Encourage bona fide farm cooperatives which
help farmers reduce the cost-price squeeze, and
protect such cooperatives against punitive tax-
ation; ,

Expand farm forestry marketing research and
price reporting on timber products, and provide


534 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS |

adequate credit designed to meet the needs of
timber farmers; and

Enact a comprehensive farm program which,
under intelligent and sympathetic Democratic
administration, will make the rural homes of
America better and healthier places in which to
live.

VI. GeneraL WELFARE

The Democratic Party believes that America
can and must adopt measures to assure every
citizen an opportunity for a full, healthy and
happy life. To this end, we pledge ourselves to
the expansion and improvement of the great
social welfare programs inaugurated under Demo-
cratic Administrations.

Social Security. By lowering the retirement
age for women and for disabled persons, the
Democratic 84th Congress pioneered two great
advances in’ Social Security, over the bitter
opposition of the Eisenhower Administration. We
shall continue our efforts to broaden and
strengthen this program by increasing benefits
to keep pace with improving standards of living;
by raising the wage base upon which benefits
depend; and by increasing benefits for each year
of covered employment.

Unemployment Insurance. We shall continue
to work for a stronger unemployment insurance
system, with broader coverage and increased
benefits consistent with rising earnings. We shall
also work for the establishment of a floor to assure
minimum level and duration of benefits, and fair
eligibility rules.

Wage Losses Due to Illness. In 1946, a Demo-
cratic Congress enacted an insurance program to
protect railroad workers against temporary wage
losses due to short-term illnesses. Because this
program has worked so effectively, we favor ex-
tending similar protection to other workers.

Public Assistance. We pledge improvements
in the public assistance program even beyond
those enacted by the Democratic 84th Congress,
through increased aid for the aged, the blind,
dependent children, the disabled and other needy
persons who are not adequately protected by our
contributory insurance programs.

Additional Needs of Our Senior Citizens. To
meet the needs of the 14 million Americans aged
65 or over, we pledge ourselves to seek means of
assuring these citizens greater income through

expanded opportunities for employment, vo-

cational retraining and adult: education; better -
housing and health services for the aged; re-

habilitation of the physically and mentally dis-

abled to restore them to independent, productive

lives; and intensified medical and other research

aimed both at lengthening life and making the

longer life more truly livable.

Health and Medical Care. The strength of our
Nation depends on the health of our people. The
shortage of trained medical and health personnel
and facilities has impaired American health stand-
ards and has increased the cost of hospital care
beyond the financial capacities of most American
families.

We pledge ourselves to initiate programs of:
Federal financial aid, without Federal controls, for
medical education.

We pledge continuing and increased support
for hospital construction programs, as well as in-
creased Federal aid to public health services,
particularly in rural] areas.

Medical research. Mindful of the dramatic
progress made by medical research in recent
years, we shall continue to support vigorously all
efforts, both public and private, to wage relentless
war on diseases which afflict the bodies and minds

-of men. We commend the Democratic Party for

its leadership in obtaining greater Congressional
authorizations in this field.

Housing. We pledge our Party to immediate
revival of the basic housing program enacted by
the Democratic Congress in 1949, to expansion of
this program as our population and resources
grow, and to additional legislation to provide
housing for middle-income families and aged
persons.. Aware of the financial burdens which
press upon most American communities and pre-
vent them from taking full advantage of Federal
urban redevelopment and renewal programs, we
favor increasing the Federal share of the cost of
these programs.

We reaffirm the goal expressed by a Democratic
Congress in 1949 that every American family is
entitled to a “decent home and a suitable living
environment.” The Republican Administration has
sabotaged that goal by reducing the public
housing program to a fraction of the Nation’s
need,

We pledge that the housing insurance and
mortgage guarantee programs will be redirected


in the interest of the home owner, and that the
availability of low-interest housing credit will be
kept consistent with the expanding housing needs
of the Nation.

We favor providing aid to urban and suburban
communities in better planning for their future
development and redevelopment.

Education. Every American child, irrespective
of race or national origin, economic status or
place of residence, has full right under the law
and the Constitution, without discrimination, to
-every educational opportunity for developing his
potentialities.

We are now faced with shortages of educa-
tional facilities that threaten national security,
economic prosperity and human well-being. The:
resources of our States and localities are already
strained to the limit. Federal aid and action
should be provided, within the traditional frame-
work of State and local control.

We pledge the Democratic Party to the follow-
ing:

(1) Legislation providing Federal financing
to assist States and local communities to build
schools, and to: provide essential health and
safety services for all school children;

(2) Better educational, health and welfare
opportunities for children of migratory workers;

(8) Assistance to programs for training teach-
ers of exceptional children;

(4) Programs providing for the. training of
teachers to meet the critical shortage in technical
and scientific fields; and

(5) Expansion of the program of student,
teacher and cultural exchange with other nations.

Vocational Education. We commend the 84th
Congress for voting the maximum authorized
funds for vocational education under the Smith-
Hughes Act for the first time in the history of the
Act. We pledge continuing and increased support
of vocational training for youth and adults, in-
cluding aid ‘to the States and localities for area
technical-vocational schools.

Child Welfare. To keep pace with the growing
need for child care and welfare, we pledge an
expanded program of grants to the States. We
pledge continued support of adequate day care
centers to care for the children of the millions of
American mothers who work to help support their
families.

Aid to the Physically Handicapped. There are

CAMPAIGN OF 1956 535

today several million physically handicapped citi-
zens, many of whom could become self-supporting

if given the opportunity and training for rehabili- —

tation. We pledge support to a vastly expanded
rehabilitation program for these physically handi-
capped, including increased aid to the States, in
contrast to the grossly inadequate action of the
Republican Administration.

VII. Frnanciat Poricy

Tax Adjustment. A fully expanding economy
can yield enough tax revenues to meet the ines-
capable obligations of government, balance the
Federal Budget, and lighten the tax burden. The

immediate need is to correct the inequities in the _

tax structure which reflect the Republican de-
termination to favor the few: at the expense of
the many. We favor realistic tax adjustments,
giving first consideration to small independent
business and’ the small individual taxpayer.
Lower-income families need tax relief; only a
Democratic victory will assure this. We favor
an increase in the present personal tax exemption
of $600 to a minimum of at least $800.

Debt Management. The Republican debt
management policy of higher interest rates serves
only to benefit a few to the detriment of the
general taxpayer, the small borrower, and the
small and middle-class investor in Government
bonds. We pledge ourselves to a vigilant review
of our debt management policy in order to reduce
interest rates in the service of our common wel-
fare.

Protection of Investors. Effective administra-
tion of the Federal securities laws has been under-
mined by Republican appointees with conflicting
interests. . Millions of investors who have bought
securities with their savings are today without
adequate protection. We favor vigorous ad-
ministration and revision of the laws to provide

investor safeguards for securities extensively .

traded in the over-the-counter market, for foreign
securities distributed in the United States, and
against proxy contest. abuses.

VIII. GovERNMENT OPERATIONS

The Democratic Party pledges that it will re-
turn the administration of our National Govern-
ment to a sound, efficient, and honest basis.

Civil Service and Federal Employee Relations.
The Eisenhower Administration has failed either


536 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

to understand or trust the Federal employee. Its
record in personnel management constitutes a
grave indictment of policies reflecting prejudices
and excessive partisanship to the detriment of
employee morale.

Intelligent and sympathetic programs must be
immediately undertaken to insure the re-establish-
ment of the high morale and efficiency which were
characteristic of the Federal worker during 20
years of Democratic Administrations.

To accomplish these objectives, we propose:

(1) Protection and extension of the merit sys-
tem through the enactment of laws to specify the
rights and responsibilities of workers;

(2) A more independent Civil Service Com-
mission in order that it may provide the intelli-
gent leadership essential in perfecting a. proper
Civil Service System;

(3) Promotion within the Federal Service
under laws assuring advancement on merit and
proven ability;

(4) Salary increases of a nature that will insure
a truly competitive scale at all levels of employ-
ment;

(5) Recognition by law of the right of em-
ployee organizations to represent their members
and to participate in the formulation and im-
provement of personnel policies and practices; and

(6) A fair and non-political loyalty program,
by law, which will protect the Nation against
' subversion and the employee against unjust and
un-American treatment.

Restoring the Efficiency of the Postal Service.
The bungling policies of the Republican Adminis-
tration have crippled and impaired the morale,
efficiency and reputation of the U.S. Postal Serv-
ice. Mail carriers and clerks and other Postal
employees are compelled to work under intoler-
able conditions. Communication by mai] and
service by parcel post have been delayed and
retarded with resulting hardships, business losses

and inconveniences. A false concept of economy -

has impaired seriously the efficiency of the best
communication system in the world.

We pledge ourselves to programs which will:

(1) Restore the principle that the Postal Serv-
ice is a public service to be operated in the
interest of improved business economy and better
commumication, as well as an aid to the dissemi-
nation of information and intelligence;

(2) Restore Postal employee morale through

the strengthening of the merit system, with pro-
motions by law rather than. caprice or partisan
politics, and payment of realistic salaries reflect-
ing the benefits of an expanded economy;

(3) Establish a program of research and de-
velopment on a scale adequate to insure the most
modern and efficient handling of the mails; and

(4) Undertake modernization and construc-
tion of desperately needed Postal facilities de-
signed to insure the finest Postal system in the
world.

selfish manipulation have characterized Federal
Administration during the Eisenhower years.
Taxpayers, paying billions of dollars each year
to their Government, demand and must have the
highest standards of honesty, integrity and
efficiency as a minimum requirement of Federal
Executive conduct. We pledge a strong merit
system as a ‘substitute for cynical policies of
spoils and special favor which are now the rule
of the day. We seek the constant improvement of
the Federal Government apparatus to accomplish
these ends.

Under certain conditions, we recognize the
need for the employment of personnel without
compensation in ‘the Executive Branch of the
Government. But the privileges extended these
dollar-a-year men have resulted in grave abuses
of power. Some of these representatives of large
corporations ‘have assumed a dual loyalty to the
Government and to the corporations that pay
them. These abuses under the Republican .Ad-
ministration have been scandalous. The Demo-
cratic Party proposes that any necessary use of
non-compensated employees shall be made only
after the most careful scrutiny and under the
most rigidly prescribed safeguards to prevent any
conflict of interests.

Freedom of Information.. During recent years
there has developed a practice on the part of
Federal agencies to delay and withhold informa-
tion which is needed by Congress and the general
public to make important decisions affecting
their lives and destinies. We believe that this
trend toward secrecy in Government should be
reversed and that the Federal Government should

return to its basic tradition of exchanging and |

promoting the freest flow of information possible
in those unclassified areas where secrets involving
weapons development and bona fide national

* Conflict of Interests. Maladministration and


security are not involved. We condemn the
Eisenhower Administration for the excesses prac-
ticed in this vital area, and pledge the Demo-
cratic Party to reverse this tendency, substituting
a rule of law for that of broad claims of executive
privilege.

We reaffirm our position of 1952 “to ‘press
strongly for world-wide freedom in the gathering
and dissemination of news.” We shall press for
free access to information throughout the world
for our journalists and scholars.

Clean Elections. The shocking disclosures in
the last Congress of attempts by selfish interests
to exert improper influence on members of Con-
gress have resulted in a Congressional investiga-
tion now under way. The Democratic Party
pledges itself to provide effective regulation and
full disclosure of campaign expenditures . and
contributions in elections to Federal offices.

Equal Rights Amendment. We of the Demo-
cratic Party recommend and. irdorse for sub-
mission to the Congress a Constitutional amend-
ment providing equal rights for women.

Veterans Administration. We are spending
approximately 434 billion dollars per year on
veterans’ benefits. There are more than 22 million
veterans in civil life today and approximately 4
million veterans or dependents of deceased
veterans drawing. direct cash benefits from the
Veterans Administration. It is clear that a matter
of such magnitude demands more prominence in
the affairs of Government. We pledge that we
will elevate the Veterans Administration to a
place of dignity commensurate with its importance
in national affairs.

We charge the present Administration with
open hostility toward the veterans’ hospital
program as disclosed by its efforts to restrict
severely that program in fiscal year 1954. We

further charge the Administration with incompe--

tence and gross neglect in the handling of
veterans’ benefits in the following particulars:

(1) The refusal to allow service connection for
disabilities incurred in or aggravated by military
service, and the unwarranted reduction of disa-
bility evaluations in cases where service connection
has been allowed; and

(2) The failure to give proper protection to
veterans purchasing homes under the VA home
loan program both by inadequate supervision of
the program and, in some instances, by active

CAMPAIGN OF 1956 537

cooperation with unscrupulous builders, lenders
and real estate brokers.

In recognition of the valiant efforts of those
who served their Nation in its gravest hours, we
pledge:

(1) Continuance of the Veterans Administra-
tion as an independent Federal agency handling
veterans programs;

(2) Continued recognition of war veterans,
with adequate compensation for the service-con-
nected disabled and for the survivors of those
who have passed away in service or from service-
incurred disabilities; and with pensions for dis-
abled and distressed veterans, and for the de-
pendents of those who have passed on, where
they are in need or unable to provide for them-
selves;

(3) Maintenance of the Veterans Administra-
tion hospital system, with no impairment in the
high quality of medical and hospital service;

(4) Priority of hospitalization for the service-
connected disabled, and the privilege of hospital
care when beds are available for the non-service-
connected illness of veterans who are sick and
without funds or unable to procure private hospi-
talization;

(5) Fair administration of veterans preference

Jaws, and employment opportunities for handi- .

capped and disabled veterans;

(6) Full hearings for war veterans filing valid
applications with the review, corrective and settle-
ment boards of the Federal Government; and

(7) Support for legislation to obtain an exten-
sion of the current law to enable veterans to ob-
tain homes and farms through the continuance of
the GI Loan Program.

Statehood for Alaska and Hawaii. We condemn
the Republican Administration for its utter disre-
gard of the rights to statehood of both Alaska
and Hawaii. These territories have contributed
greatly to our national economic and cultural
life and are vital to our defense. They. are part
of America and should be recognized as.such. We
of the Democratic Party, therefore, pledge im-
mediate Statehood for these two territories. We
commend these territories for the action their
people have taken in the adoption of constitutions
which will become effective forthwith when they
are admitted into the Union.

Puerto Rico. The Democratic Party views with

satisfaction the progress and growth achieved by


§38 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

Puerto Rico since its political organization as a
Commonwealth under Democratic Party leader-
ship. We pledge, once again, our continued sup-
port of the Commonwealth and its development
and growth along lines of increasing responsi-
bility and authority, keeping as functions of the
Federal Government only such as are essential
to the existence of the compact of association
adopted by the Congress of the United States
and the people of Puerto Rico.

The progress of Puerto Rico under Common-
wealth status has been notable proof of the great
benefits which flow from self-government and
the good neighbor policy which under Demo-
cratic leadership this country has always fol-
lowed. —

Virgin Islands. We favor increased self-govern-
ment for the Virgin Islands to provide for an
elected Governor and a Resident Commissioner
in the Congress of the United States. We de-
nounce the scandalous administration of the first
Eisenhower-appointed Governor of the Virgin
Islands.

Other Territories and Possessions. We favor in-
creased self-government for Guam, other out-
lying territories and the Trust Territory of the
Pacific.

District of Columbia. We favor immediate
home rule and ultimate national representation
for the District of Columbia.

American Indians. Recognizing that all
American Indians are citizens of the United
States and of the States in which they reside, and
acknowledging that the Federal Government
has a unique legal and moral responsibility
for Indians which is imposed by the Constitution
and spelled out in treaties, statutes and court
decisions, we pledge:

Prompt adoption of a Federal program to assist
Indian tribes in the full development of their
human and natural resources, and to advance the
health, education and economic well-being of
Indian citizens, preserving their traditions with-
out impairing ‘their cultural heritage;

No alteration of any treaty or other Federal-
Indian ‘contractual relationships without the free
consent of the Indian tribes concerned; reversal
of the present policies which are tending toward
erosion of Indian rights, reduction of their eco-
nomic base through alienation of their lands, and
repudiation of Federal responsibility;

Prompt and expeditious settlement of Indian
claims against the United States, with full recog-
nition of the rights of both parties; and

Elimination of all impediments to full citizen-
ship for American Indians.

Governmental Balance. The Democratic Party
has upheld its belief in the Constitution as a
charter of individual rights, an effective instru-
ment for human progress. Democratic Adminis-
trations placed upon the statute books during their
last 20 years a multitude of measures which
testify to our belief in the Jeffersonian principle
of local control even in general legislation in-
volving Nation-wide programs. Selective Service,
Social Security, agricultural adjustment, low-
rent housing, hospital, and many other legislative

programs have placed major responsibilities in.
States and counties, and provide fine examples

of how benefits.can be extended through Federal-
State cooperation.

While we recognize the existence of honest
differences of opinion as to the true location of
the Constitutional line of demarcation between
the Federal Government and the States, the
Democratic Party expressly recognizes the vital
importance of the respective States in our Federal.
Union. The Party of Jefferson and Jackson pledges
itself to continued support of those sound princi-
ples of local government which will best serve
the welfare of our people and the safety of our
democratic rights.

Improving Congressional: Procedures. In order
that the will of the American people may. be
expressed upon all legislative proposals, we urge
that action be taken at the beginning of the 85th
Congress to improve Congressional procedures so
that majority rule prevails and decisions can be
made after reasonable debate without being
blocked. by a minority in either House.

IX. NaruraL Resources

Our national economic strength and welfare’

depend primarily upon the development of our
land, water, mineral and energy resources, with
which this Nation has been abundantly blessed.

We pledge unstinting support to a full and
integrated program of development, protection,
management and conservation of all of our natural
resources for all of the people.

The framework of time-tested conservation and
mining policy is fixed in laws under which America


has developed its natural resources for the
general welfare. .

The Democratic 84th Congress has remained
steadfast to this traditional policy. It has built
upon the tremendous conservation and develop-
ment achievements of the Roosevelt and. Truman
Administrations by undertaking the greatest pro-
gram of natural resources development ever
assumed by any Congress in our Nation’s history.

This constructive Democratic record, em-
bracing all resources of land, water, energy and
minerals, is in sharp contrast to the faithless per-
formance of the Eisenhower Administration which
has despoiled future generations of their heritage
by utter failure to safeguard natural resources.
Our people will long remember this betrayal of
their heritage as symbolized by the infamous
Dixon-Yates contract; the Al Sarena timber
scheme; the low-level Hells Canyon Dams; and
for its unreasonable resistance to authorizing the
Niagara Project which would benefit so many
millions in the State of New York and adjacent
areas.

We condemn, and will continue to decry, this
pillaging of our dwindling natural resource wealth
through political manipulation and administrative
subversion by the Eisenhower Administration. We
pledge ourselves to halt this betrayal of the
people’s trust.

We shall devise for the American people a
dynamic, far-reaching and progressive conserva-
tion program.

The Democratic Party proposes, and will strive
to secure, this comprehensive resources program
for America’s future.

Land. Our land will be preserved and improved
for the present and future needs of our people,
and not wastefully exploited to benefit special-
interest groups.

Soil Conservation. In contrast to the wasteful
neglect of the present Administration, soil conser-
vation practices will be stimulated and intensified
to reduce land deterioration under the vital Soil
Conservation Service assistance program con-
ceived and fostered by the Democratic Party.

National Parks, Recreation and Wildlife. We
pledge adoption of an immediate and broad policy
to mobilize the efforts of private and public
agencies for protection ‘of existing recreational
areas, provision of new ones, and improvement of
inadequate facilities. Slum conditions fostered

CAMPAIGN OF 1956 539

by Republican neglect are intolerable to the tens
of millions of Americans using our national parks
and forests. Democratic Administration will end
this shocking situation.

Fish and game habitats will be guarded against
encroachment for commercial purposes. All river
basin development plans will take into full con-

sideration their effect upon fish, wildlife, national .

park and wilderness areas. The Fish and Wildlife
Service must and will be returned to the career
status from which it was removed by the political

patronage policy of the present Administration. _

Recreational facilities for the millions of field
and stream sportsmen of America will be con-
served and expanded.

Forest and Grazing Lands. Timber on Federal
commercial forest lands will be harvested and
managed on a sustained-yield basis.

We propose to increase forest access roads in
order to improve cutting practices on both public

-and private lands.

Private owners of farm, forest and range lands
need and must have financial and technical assist-
ance so that all lands will be utilized to contribute
more fully to the national welfare by production
of food and fiber and protection of our water-
sheds. Any effort to transform grazing permits
from a revocable license to a vested right will be
rejected. 7

We will vigorously advocate Federally-financed
forestation, upstream erosion control and flood
control programs on our public range, timber
lands and small drainage basins to protect our
watersheds and double the rate of forage and
commercial timber growth. We will promote co-
operative programs with Government assistance
to reduce timber losses from fire, insects, and
disease.

Prospecting and mining on unreserved Federal
lands will be encouraged, but surface areas not
needed in mining will be safeguarded by ap-
propriate legislation.

Water. We pledge the resumption of rapid
and orderly multiple-purpose river basin develop-
ment throughout the country. This program will

bring into reality the full potential benefits of

flood control, irrigation and our domestic and
municipal water supply from surface and under-
ground waters. It will also materially aid low-
cost power, navigation, recreation, fish and wild-
life propagation and mineral development. We


|

‘540 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

pledge our aid to the growing requirements of
the semiarid Western States for an adequate water

‘supply to meet the vital domestic, irrigation and

industrial: needs of the rapidly growing urban
centers. Enhanced regional economies will
strengthen the economy of the Nation as a whole.
We will take appropriate and vigorous steps
to prevent comprehensive drainage basin develop-
ment plans from being fragmented by single-
purpose projects. The conservation of water is
essential to the life of the Nation. The Demo-
cratic Party pledges itself to conservation of water
in the public interest. :
The Democratic 84th Congress has taken a
long step toward reducing the pollution of our
rivers and streams. We pledge continuation and
expansion of this program, vital to every citizen.
The program of obtaining a large new source
of fresh water supply from salt water was begun
by the Democratic Party, but has been allowed
to lapse by the Eisenhower Republican ‘Ad-
ministration. It will be resumed and accelerated.
Energy. We pledge ourselves to carry forward,
under national policy, aggressive programs to pro-
vide abundant supplies of low-cost energy, in-
cluding continued research for the development
of synthetic liquid fuel from coal, shale and
agricultural products. These we must have to
feed: our insatiable industrial economy, to enable
our workers to develop their skills and increase
their productivity, to provide more jobs at higher
wages, to meet the ever-mounting demands for

domestic and farm uses, including the production

of lower-cost farm fertilizers and lower-cost power
to consumers.

We will carry forward increased and full
production of hydroelectric power on our rivers
and of steam generation for the Tennessee Valley
Authority to meet its peacetime and defense re-
quirements. Such self-liquidating projects must
go forward in a rapid and orderly manner, with
appropriate financing plans. Integrated regional

transmission systems will enhance exchange of

power and encourage diversified industrial de-
velopment.

We shall once more rigorously enforce the
anti-monopoly and public body preference clauses,
including the Holding Company Act, administra-
tively circumvented by the Eisenhower Republi-
can Administration. We shall. preserve and
strengthen the public power competitive yard-

}

stick in power developments under TVA, REA,
Bureau of Reclamation, Bonneville, Southeast
and Southwest Power Administrations and other
future projects, including atomic power plants,
under a policy of the widest possible use of
electric energy at the lowest possible cost.

Minerals. The Republican Administration has
seriously neglected and ignored one of the
Nation’s basic industries, metal mining. We

recognize that a healthy mining industry is essen- ©

tial to the economy of the Nation, and therefore
pledge immediate efforts toward the establish-
ment of a realistic, long-range minerals policy.
The Nation’s. minerals and fuels are essential to
the safety, security and development of our coun-
try. We pledge the adoption of policies which
will further encourage the exploration and de-
velopment of additional reserves of our mineral
resources,

Domestic Fisheries. We will undertake compre-
hensive scientific and economic research programs
for the conservation and better utilization of, and
new markets for, fishery products. We favor and
will encourage reciprocal world trade in fish
products.

We pledge ourselves to a public works and
water policy providing adequate protection for
domestic fishery resources.

We favor treaties with other nations for conser-
vation and better utilization of international
fisheries.

Scenic Resources. To the end that the scenic
beauty of our land may be preserved and main-
tained for this and future generations to enjoy,
we pledge accelerated support of educational
programs to stimulate individual responsibility
and pride in clean, attractive surroundings—from
big cities to rural areas.

X. Atomic ENERGY

The atomic era came into being and was de-
veloped under Democratic Administrations.

The genius of American scientists, engineers
and workmen, supported by the vision and cour-
age of Franklin D. Roosevelt, made possible the
splitting of the atom and the development of the
first atomic bomb in time to end World War II.

With the ending of the war, the supremacy of

_ America in atomic weapons was maintained under

the leadership of President Truman, and the
United States pushed ahead. vigorously toward


utilizirig this new form of energy in peaceful
pursuits, particularly in the fields of medicine,
agriculture and industry. By the end of the
Truman Administration, the pre-eminence of the
United States in the nuclear field was clearly
established, and we were on the threshold of
large-scale development of industrial nuclear
energy at home and-as an instrument of world
peace.

The Eisenhower Administration promptly
reversed the field and plunged the previously
independent and nonpartisan Atomic Energy
Commission into partisan politics. For example,
President Eisenhower ordered the Commission to
sign the scandalous Dixon-Yates contract. He
was later forced to repudiate the same contract,
after the exposure of the illegal activities of one
of his own consultants with a secret office in the
Bureau of the Budget.

The Republican Administration has followed
the same pattern in the field of atomic energy
that it has pursued in its treatment of other
natural resources—lofty words, little action, but
steady service to selfish interests. While the AEC
and the special private interests consult and
confer, the United States is lagging instead of
leading in the world race for nuclear power, inter-
national prestige and world markets,

The Democrats in Congress believed that the
national interest thus became imperiled, and they
moved to meet the challenge both at home and
abroad. They established’a nonpartisan panel of
eminent Americans to study the impact of the
peaceful atom.

Following the comprehensive report of this
panel, the Joint Congressional Committee on
' Atomic Energy held extensive hearings on bills
to accelerate the atomic reactor demonstration
program. Though the bills were reported unani-

mously from committee, the Republican members |

of Congress, under heavy pressure from the White
House,. insured the final defeat of this legislation
in the Congress.

But the fight to bring. nuclear power to the
people has only begun. As the United States
was first in the development of the atom .as a
weapon, so the United States must lead in bring-
ing the blessings of the peaceful uses of nuclear
energy to mankind.

Hence, the Democratic Party pledges itself:

(1) To restore nonpartisan administration of

CAMPAIGN OF 1956 541

the vital atomic energy program and to expand

and accelerate nuclear development by vigorous
action:

(2) To accelerate the domestic civilian atomic
power program by the construction of a variety
of demonstration prototype reactors;

(8) To give reality—life and meaning—to the

“Atoms for Peace” program. We will substitute
deeds for words;

(A) To increase the production of fissionable
material for use in a stockpile for peacetime
commitments at home and abroad,. and for an
ever-present reserve for weapons to guarantee
freedom in the world;

(5) To. conduct a comprehensive survey of
radiation hazards from bomb tests and reactor
operations, in order to determine what additional
measures are required to protect existing and

future generations from these invisible dangers;-

and

(6) To make the maximum contribution to
the defense of our Nation and the free world
through the development of a balanced and
flexible stockpile of nuclear weapons, containing
a sufficient number and variety to support our
armed services in any contingency.

XI. Crvit Ricuts

The Democratic Party is committed to support
and advance the individual rights and liberties
of all Americans. Our country is founded on the
proposition that all men are created equal. This
means that all citizens are equal before the law
and should enjoy all political rights. They should
have equal opportunities for education, for
economic advancement, and for decent living
conditions. ;

We will continue our efforts to eradicate
discrimination based on race, religion or national
origin. We know this task requires action, not
just in one section of the Nation, but in all
sections. It requires the cooperative efforts of
individual citizens, and action by State and local
governments, It also requires Federal action. The
Federal Government must live up to the ideals
of the Declaration of Independence and must
exercise the powers vested in it by the Constitu-
tion.

We are proud of the record of the Democratic
Party in securing equality of treatment and oppor-
tunity in the nation’s armed forces, the Civil


542 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

Service, and in all areas under Federal jurisdiction.
The Democratic Party pledges itself to continue
its efforts to eliminate illegal discriminations. of
all kinds, in relation to (1) full rights to vote, (2)
full rights to engage in gainful occupations, (3)
full rights to enjoy security of the person, and
(4) full rights to education. in all publicly sup-
ported institutions.

‘Recent decisions of the Supreme Court of the
United States relating to segregation in publicly
supported schools and elsewhere have brought
consequences of vast importance to our Nation
as a whole and especially to communities directly
affected. We reject all proposals for the use of
force to interfere with the orderly determination
of these matters by the courts.

The Democratic Party emphatically reaffirms its
support of the historic principle that ours is a
government of laws and not of men; it recognizes
the Supreme Court of the United States as
one of the three Constitutional and coordinate
branches of the Federal Government, superior to
and separate from any political party, the de-
cisions of which are part of the law of the land.
We condemn the efforts of the Republican Party
to make it appear that this tribunal is a part of
the Republican Party.

We condemn the Republican Administration’s
violation of the rights of Government employees
by a heartless and unjustified confusing of “se-
curity” and “loyalty” for the sole purpose. of
political gain and regardless of consequences to
individual victims and to the good name of the
United States. We condemn the Republican
Administration’s misrepresentation of facts and
violation of individual rights in a wicked and
unprincipled attempt to degrade and destroy the
Democratic Party, and to make political capital
for the Republican Party.

Prohibition Party Platform for 1956

PREAMBLE

We, the representatives of the Prohibition
Party, assembled in National Convention at Camp
Mack, Milford, Indiana, September 4, 5, and 6,
1955, recognizing Almighty God as the source of
all just government and with faith in the teach-
ings of the Prince of Peace, do solemnly promise
that, if our party is chosen to administer the

affairs of the nation, we will carefully use all the
powers of our administration to preserve the
rights, privileges and basic freedoms of the people
of the United States.

CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT

We solemnly affirm our loyalty to the Consti-
tution of the United States, to the principles of
liberty enunciated in our Declaration of Inde-
pendence and in the Preamble and Bill of Rights
of our Constitution, our deep confidence in our
form of government, and our earnest desire to
serve our people with a constructive program

based upon the principles of righteousness and

democracy.

We are unalterably opposed to any form of
totalitarianism. We challenge all loyal citizens
to work against this menace to civilization. We
believe that the best safeguard against these
dangerous doctrines is to preserve the rights of
our citizens by enforcing the provisions of the
Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

We deplore the actions of any administration
in exceeding its authority, through executive
agreements, thereby violating the Constitutional
prerogatives of our legislative bodies.

Wor.p PEACE

We, in this age of atomic and hydrogen bombs
(capable of destroying civilization) pledge our-
selves to search for peaceful solutions of inter-
national conflicts, under an international “good
neighbor” policy, call for an immediate outlawing
of all weapons. of annihilation, propose a pro-
gressive multi-lateral limitation of armaments and
their ultimate abolition, leading to world peace
and the brotherhood of man.

MILITARISM

We are opposed to the militarization of our
youth, through universal military training, uni-
versal conscription, or universal reserve’ service.

Economic AID

’ Our government should give much greater
emphasis to relief, rehabilitation and economic
aid, especially for technical assistance, to help the
people raise their own standard of living in the
underdeveloped areas where widespread hunger
and human misery now prepare the soil for
communist propaganda.",90568,13945,"campaign of in august, , the democrats renominated their titular leader, adlai e. stevenson of illinois, for the presidency on the first ballot. senator estes kefauver of tennessee was chosen .as the vice- presidential candidate in a distinctive open con- test—on the second ballot and over twelve other candidates including senator john f. kennedy of massachusetts. later in the month the republi- cans also renominated their candidates, in- cumbent president dwight d. eisenhower and vice-president richard m. nixon. the principal third parties in were the prohibition party, represented by enoch arden holtwick of illinois and edward m. cooper of california; the socialist party, for which darling- ton hoopes and samuel h. friedman again were the candidates; and the socialist labor party, with eric hass again the presidential candidate and georgia cozzini of wisconsin the vice-presidential candidate. farrell dobbs and myra tanner weiss again made up the socialist workers party ticket. in mid-september, delegates from several splinter groups representing voters in approxi- mately half of the states gathered in memphis, - tennessee, to form a “national conservative movement.” although the delegates supported the independent candidacy of t. coleman andrews of virginia for president and thomas h. werdel of california for vice-president, they voted against the formation of a third party and published only a declaration of principles instead of a platform. the progressive party of and did not offer a candidate in , but some minor parties were established in individual states. in the election, eisenhower increased his ma- jority by nearly million votes over his figure. the republicans polled ,, votes to ,, for the democrats. t. coleman an- drews received , votes, and the socialist labor party got ,. the prohibition party at- tracted , votes, and the socialist workers obtained ,. darlington hoopes, for the so- cialists, had , votes cast for him. president eisenhower received electoral votes to for governor stevenson and for wal- ter jones, an alabama judge. democratic platform preamble in the brief space of three and one-half years, the people of the united states have come to realize, with tragic consequences, that our national government cannot be trusted to the hands of political amateurs, dominated by repre- sentatives of special privilege. four years ago they were beguiled, by empty promises and pledges, to elect as president a recent convert to republicanism. our people have now learned that the party of lincoln has been made captive to big businessmen with small minds. they have found that they are now ruled _ by a government which they did not elect, and to which they have not given their consent. their awareness of this fact was demonstrated in when they returned control of the legislative machinery of the federal government to the 84th democratic congress. from the wreckage of american world leader- ship under a republican administration, this great democratic congress has salvaged a portion of the world prestige our nation enjoyed under the brilliant administrations of franklin delano roosevelt and harry s. truman. our democratic 84th congress made one of the greatest legislative records in the history of our country. it enacted an active program of progressive, humane legislation, which has re- pudiated the efforts of reactionary republicanism to stall america’s progress. when we return to the halls of congress next january, and with a democratic president in the white house, it will be the plan and purpose of our party to complete ‘restoration and rehabilitation of american leader- ship in world affairs. we pledge return of our - national government to its rightful owners, the people of the united states. on the threshold of an atomic age, in mid- twentieth century, our beloved nation needs the vision, vigor and vitality which can be infused into it only by a government under the demo- cratic party. we approach the forthcoming election with national party platforms a firm purpose of effecting such infusion; and with the help and assistance of divine providence we shall endeavor to accomplish it. to the end— that the people it has served so well may know our program for the return of america to the highway of progress, the democratic ‘party herewith submits its platform for . i. foreicn poticy and national defense the democratic party affirms that world peace is a primary objective of human society. peace is more than a suspension of shooting while frenzied and fearful nations stockpile armaments of annihi- lation. achievement of world peace requires political statesmanship and economic wisdom, international understanding and dynamic leadership. true peace is the tranquillity of ordered justice on a global scale. it may be destroyed without a shot being fired. it can be fostered and preserved only by the solid unity and common brotherhood of the peoples of the world in the cause of freedom. _ the hopes and aspirations of the peoples of all nations for justice and peace depend largely upon the courageous and enlightened administration of the foreign and defense policies of the united states. we deplore the fact that the administra- tion of both policies since has confused timidity with courage, and blindness with en- lightenment. the republican record of confusion and complacency is the president's responsibility. the world’s hopes for lasting peace depend upon the conduct of our foreign policy, a function which the constitution vests in the president of the united states and one which has not been effectively exercised by, president eisenhower. since , responsibility for foreign affairs has been president eisenhower's, his alone, and his in full. in the past three years, his conduct of our policies has moved us into realms where we risk grave danger. he has failed to seek peace with determination, for his disarmament policy has failed to strike hard at the institution of war. his handling of the day-by-day problems of inter- national affairs has unnecessarily and dangerously subjected the american people to the risk of atomic world war. . our government lacks leadership. we need bold leadership, yet in the three years since stalin’s death, in the full year since president eisenhower's meeting at the “summit,” the re- publican administration has not offered a single concrete new idea to meet the new-style political and economic offensive of the soviets, which represents, potentially, an even graver challenge than stalin’s use of force. president eisenhower and his secretary of state talk at cross-purposes, praising neutralism one day, condemning it the next.. the republicans ‘seem unable either to make up their minds or to give us leadership, while the unity of the free world rapidly dis- integrates. we in america need to make our peaceful pur- pose clear beyond dispute in every corner of the world—yet secretary dulles brags of “brinks of war.” we need a foreign policy which rises above jockeying for partisan position or advantage—yet, not in memory has there been so little bipartisan- ship in the administration of our policies, so little candor in their presentation to our people, so much pretending that things are better than they are. the republican bluster and bluff. four years ago the republican party boasted of being able to produce a foreign policy which was to free the communist satellites, unleash chiang kai-shek, repudiate the wartime agreements, and reverse the policy of containing communist expansion. since they have done just the opposite, standing silent when the peoples rise in east germany and poland, and thereby weakening the positive democratic policy of halting communist expansion. our friends lose faith in us. our friends abroad. now doubt our sincerity. they have seen the solid assurance of collective security under a democratic administration give place to the un- certainties of personal diplomacy. they have seen the ties of our international alliances and friendship weakened by inept republican ma- .neuvering. : they have seen traditional action and boldness in foreign affairs evaporate into republican complacency, retrenchment and empty posturing. the failure abroad. blustering without dy- namic action will not alter the fact that. the unity and strength of the free world have been drasti- cally impaired. witness the decline of nato, the bitter tragedy of cyprus, the withdrawal of french forces to north africa, the uncertainty and dangers in the middle east, an uncertain and insecure germany, and resentment rising against united states leadership everywhere. in asia—in burma, ceylon, indonesia, india— anti-americanism grows apace, aggravated by the clumsy actions of our government, and fanned by the inept utterances of our “statesmen.” in the middle east, the eisenhower adminis- tration has dawdled and drifted. the results have been disastrous, and worse threatens. only the good offices of the united nations in maintain- ing peace between israel and her neighbors conceal the diplomatic incapacities of the re- publican administration. the current crisis over suez is a consequence of inept and vacillating republican policy. our government’s mistakes have placed us in a position in the middle east which threatens the free world with a loss of power and prestige, potentially more dangerous than any we have suffered in the past decade. the failure at home. political considerations of budget balancing and tax reduction now come before the wants of our national security and the needs of our allies. the republicans have slashed our own armed strength, weakened our capacity to deal with military threats, stifled our air force, starved our army and weakened our capacity to deal with aggression of any sort save by retreat or by the alternatives, “massive retaliation” and global atomic war. yet, while our troubles mount, they tell us our prestige was never higher, they tell us we were never more secure. the challenge is for democracy to meet. the democratic party believes that “waging peace” is a monumental task to be performed honestly, forthrightly, with dedication and consistent effort. the way to lasting peace is to forego bluster and bluff, to regain steadiness of purpose, to join again in faithful concert with the community of free nations, to look realistically at the challenging circumstances which confront us, to face them candidly and imaginatively, and to return to the democratic policy of peace through strength. this is a task for democrats. this facing of new problems, this rising to new challenges, has been our party’s mission and its glory for three generations past. president truman met and mastered stalin’s challenge a decade’ ago, with boldness, courage and imagination, and so will we turn to the challenge before us now, pressing the search for real and lasting peace. to this we pledge: support for the united nations. the united ‘nations is indispensable for the maintenance of world peace and for the settlement of contro- campaign of versies between nations small and large. we pledge our every effort to strengthen its usefulness and expand its role as guide and guardian of international security and peace. we deplore the republicans’ tendency to use the united nations only. when it suits them, ignoring or by passing ‘it whenever they please. we pledge determined opposition to the ad- mission of the communist chinese into the united nations. they have proven their com- plete hostility to the purposes of this organiza- tion. we pledge continued support to national- ist china. , release of american prisoners. we urge a continuing effort to effect the release of all americans detained by communist china. support for effective disarmament. in_ this atomic age, war threatens the very survival of civilization. to eliminate the danger of atomic war, a universal, effective and enforced disarma- ment system must be the goal of responsible men and women everywhere. so long as we lack en- forceable international control of weapons, we must maintain armed strength to avoid war. but technological advances in the field of nuclear weapons make disarmament an ever more urgent problem. time and distance can never again pro- tect any nation of the world. the eisenhower administration, despite its highly publicized pro- posals for aerial inspection, has made no progress toward this great objective. we pledge the democratic party to pursue vigorously this great goal of enforced disarmament in full awareness that irreparable injury, even total destruction, now threatens the human race. adequate defense forces. we reject the false republican notion that this country can afford only a second-best defense. we stand for strong defense forces so clearly superior in modern weapons to those of any possible enemy that our armed strength will make an attack upon the free world unthinkable, and thus be a major force for world peace. the republican administration stands indicted for failing to recognize the necessity of proper living standards for the men and women of our armed forces and their families. we. pledge ourselves to the better- ment of the living conditions of the members. of our armed services, and to a needed increase in the so-called “fringe benefits.” training for defense. the democratic party pledges itself to a bold and imaginative program national party platforms devised to utilize fully the: brain power of america’s youth,, including its talent in the scientific and technical fields. scholarships and loan assistance and such other steps as may be determined desirable must be employed to secure this objective. this is solely in the interest of necessary and adequate national defense. strengthening civil defense. we believe that a strong, effective civil defense is a necessary part of national defense. advances in nuclear weapons have made existing civil defense legislation and practices obsolete. we pledge ourselves to establish a real program for protecting the civilian population and industry of our nation in place of the present weak and ineffective program. we believe that this is essentially a federal responsibility. _ collective security arrangements. the demo- cratic party inaugurated and we strongly favor collective defense arrangements, such as nato and the organization of american states, within the framework of the united nations. we realize, as the republicans have not, that mutually recog- nized common interests can be flexibly adapted to the varied needs and aspirations of all countries concerned. winning the productivity race. the republi- can party has not grasped one of the dominant facts of mid-century—that the growth of pro- ductive power of the communist states presents a challenge which cannot be-evaded. the demo- cratic party is confident that, through the freedom we enjoy, a vast increase in productive power of our nation and our allies will be achieved, and by their combined capacity they will surmount any challenge. economic development abroad. we believe that, in the cause of peace, america must support the efforts of underdeveloped countries on a co- operative basis to organize their own resources and to increase their own economic productivity, so that they may enjoy the higher living standards which science and modern industry make possible. we will give renewed strength to programs of economic and technical assistance. we support a multilateral approach to these programs, where- ever possible, so that burdens are shared and resources pooled among all the economically de- veloped countries with the capital and: skills to help in this great task. further, while recognizing the relation of our national security to the role of the united states in international affairs, the democratic party believes the time has come for a realistic re- appraisal of the american foreign aid program, particularly as to its extent and the conditions under which it should be continued. this re- appraisal will determine the standards by which further aid shall be granted, keeping in mind america’s prime objective of securing world peace. bringing the truth to the world. the tools of truth and candor are even more important than economic tools. the democratic party believes that once our government is purged of the con- fusion and complacency fostered by the re- publican administration.a new image of america will emerge in the world: the image of a confident america dedicated to its traditional principles, eager to work with other peoples, honest in its pronouncements, and consistent in its policies. freedom for captive nations. we condemn the republican administration for its heartless record of broken promises to the unfortunate victims of communism. candidate eisenhower's pledges to “liberate” the captive peoples ‘have been disavowed and dishonored. we declare our deepest concern for the plight of the freedom-loving peoples of central and eastern europe and of asia, now under the yoke of soviet dictatorship. the united states, under democratic leaders, has never recognized the forcible annexation of lithuania, latvia, and estonia, or condoned the extension of the krem- lin’s tyranny over poland, bulgaria, rumania, czechoslovakia, hungary, albania and other countries. ‘ we look forward to the day when the liberties of all captive nations will be restored to them and they can again take their rightful place in the community of free nations. we shall press before the united nations the principle that soviet russia withdraw its troops from the captive countries, so as to permit free, fair and unfettered elections in the subjugated areas, in compliance with the atlantic charter and other binding commitments. upholding the principle of self-determination. we rededicate ourselves to. the high principle of | national self-determination, as enunciated by woodrow wilson, whose: leadership brought freedom and independence to uncounted millions. it is the policy of the democratic party, there- fore, to encourage and assist small nations and all peoples, behind the iron curtain and outside, in the peaceful and orderly achievement of their legitimate aspirations toward political, geographi- cal, and ethnic integrity, so that they may dwell in the family of sovereign nations with freedom and dignity. we are opposed to colonialism and communist imperialism. we shall endeavor to apply this principle to the desires of all peoples for self-determination. reciprocal trade among the nations. the democratic party has always worked for ex- panding trade among free nations. expanding world trade is necessary not only for our friends, but for ourselves; it is the way to meet america’s . growing need for industrial raw materials. we shall continue to support vigorously the hull reciprocal trade program. under democratic administrations, the opera- tion of this act was conducted in a manner that recognized equities for agriculture, industry and labor. under the present republican administra- tion, there has been a most flagrant disregard of these important segments of our economy resulting in serious economic injury to hundreds of thousands of americans engaged in these pursuits. we pledge correction of these con- ditions. encouraging european unity. through the marshall plan, the european economic organiza- tion and nato, the democratic party encouraged and supported efforts to achieve greater economic and political unity among the free nations of europe, and to increase the solidarity of the nations of the north atlantic community. we will continue those efforts, taking into account the viewpoints and aspirations of different sectors of the european community, particularly in regard to practical proposals for the unification of ger- many. _ ‘peace and justice in the middle east. the democratic party stands for the maintenance of peace in the middle east, which is essential to the well-being and progress of all its peoples. we will urge israel and the arab states to settle their differences by peaceful means, and to maintain the sanctity of the holy places in the _ holy land and permit free access to them. we will assist israel to build a sound and viable economy for her people, so that she may fulfill her humanitarian mission of providing shelter and sanctuary for her homeless jewish refugees while strengthening her national development. campaign of we will assist the arab states to develop their economic resources and raise the living standards of their people. the plight of the arab refugees commands our continuing sympathy and concem. we will assist in carrying out large-scale projects for their resettlement in countries where there is room and opportunity for them. we support the principle of free access to the suez canal under suitable international auspices. the present policies of the eisenhower ad- ministration in the middle east are unnecessarily increasing the risk that war will break out in this area. to prevent war, to ‘assure peace, we will faithfully carry out our country’s pledge under the tripartite declaration of to oppose the use or threat of force and to take such action as may be necessary in the interest of peace, both within and outside the united nations, to prevent any violation of the frontiers of any armistice lines. the democratic party will act to redress the dangerous imbalance of arms in the area resulting from the shipment of communist arms to egypt, by selling or supplying defensive weapons to israel, and will take such steps, including security guarantees, as may be required to deter aggression and war in the area. we oppose, as contrary to american principles, the practice of any government which discrimi- nates against american citizens on grounds of race or religion. we will not countenance any arrangement or treaty with any government which by its terms or in its practical application would sanction such practices. support for free asia. the people of asia seek a new and freer life and they are in a com- mendable hurry to get it. they struggle against poverty, ill health and illiteracy. in the aftermath of war, china became a victim of communist tyranny. but many new free nations have arisen in south and southeast asia. south korea remains free, and the new japan has abandoned her former imperial and aggressive ways. america’s task and interest in asia is to help the govern- ments of free peoples demonstrate that they have improved living standards without yielding to communist tyranny or domination by anyone. that task will be carried out under democratic leadership. support of our good neighbors to the south. in the western hemisphere the democratic party will restore the policy of the “good neigh- national party platforms bor” which has been alternately neglected and abused by the republican administration. we pledge ourselves to fortify the defenses of the americas, in this respect, we will intensify our cooperation with our neighboring republics to help them strengthen their economies, improve educational opportunities, and combat disease. we will strive to make the western hemisphere an inspiring example of what free peoples working together can accomplish. progressive immigration policies. | america’s jong tradition of hospitality and asylum for those seeking freedom, opportunity, and -escape from oppression, has been besmirched by the delays, failures and broken promises of the republican administration. _the democratic party favors prompt revision of the immigration and nationality laws to eliminate unfair provisions under which admissions to this country depend upon quotas based upon the accident of national origin. proper safeguards against subversive elements should be provided. our immigration procedures must re- flect the principles of our bill of rights. we favor eliminating the provisions of law which charge displaced persons admitted to our shores against quotas for future years. through such “mortgages” of future quotas, thousands of qualified persons. are being forced to wait long years before they can hope for admission. | we also favor more liberal admission of rela- tives to eliminate the unnecessary: tragedies of broken families. we favor elimination of unnecessary distinc- tions between native-born and naturalized citizens. there should be no “second class” citizenship in the united states. the administration of the refugee relief act of has been a disgrace to our country. rescue has been denied to innocent, defenseless and suffering people, the victims of war and the aftermath of wars. the purpose of the act has been defeated by republican mismanagement. victims of communist oppression. we will continue to support programs providing succor for escapees from behind the iron curtain, and bringing help to the victims of war and com- munist oppression. , ; . the challenge of the next four years. today new challenges call for new ideas and new methods. in the coming years, our great necessity will be to pull together as a people, with true non- partisanship in foreign affairs under leaders in- formed, courageous and responsible. we shall need: to work closely with each other as americans. if we here indict the republican record, we acknowledge gratefully the efforts of individual republicans to achieve true bipartisan- - ship. in this spirit an affirmative, cooperative policy can be developed. we shall need to work closely, also, with others all around ‘the world. for there is much to do—to create once more the will and the power to transform the principles of the united nations into a living reality; to awaken ourselves and others to the effort and - sacrifice which alone can win justice and peace: ii. the domestic poticy—tue republican reaction to years of progress the democratic bequest. twenty years of vivid democratic accomplishments revived and reinforced our economic system, and. wrote humanity upon the statute books. all this, the current republican administration inherited. the republican brand of prosperity. substi- tuting deceptive slogans and dismal deeds for the democratic program, the republicans have been telling the american people that “we are now more prosperous than ever before in peacetime.” for the american farmer, the small. businessman and the low-income worker, the old people living on a pittance, the young people seeking an american standard of education, and the minority groups seeking full employment opportunity at adequate wages, this tall tale of republican pros- perity has been an illusion. the evil is slowly but surely infiltrating the entire economic system. its fever signs are evi- denced by soaring monopoly profits, while wages lag, farm income collapses, and small-business failures multiply at an alarming rate. the first time-bomb of the republican crusade against full prosperity for all was the hard-money policy. this has increased the debt burden on depressed farms, saddled heavier costs on small business, foisted higher interest charges on millions of homeowners (including veterans), pushed up unnecessarily the cost of. consumer credit, and swelled the inordinate profits of a few lenders of money. it has wrought havoc with the bond market, with resulting financial loss to the ordinary owners of .government bonds. the republican tax policy has joined hands in an unholy alliance with the hard-money policy. { fantastic misrepresentation of the government's budgetary position has been used to deny tax relicf to low- and middle-income families, while tax concessions and handouts have been gener- . ously sprinkled among potential campaign con- tributors to republican coffers. the disastrously reactionary farm program, the hardhearted re- sistance to adequate expansion of social security and other programs for human well-being, and favoritism in the award of government contracts, all have watered the economic tree at the top and neglected its roots. the stunting of our economic progress. the republicans say that employment and production are “higher” than ever before. the fact is that our over-all rate of growth has been crippled and stunted in contrast to its faster increase during the democratic years from to , after world war ii. with production lagging behind full capacity, unemployment has grown. the republican claim that this stunted pros- perity is the price of peace is a distortion. national-security outlays have averaged a higher part of our total production during these re- publican years than during -, and yet the annual growth in total production during these republican years has been only about percent as fast as in the preceding democratic years. the progress of low-income families toward an american standard of living, rapid during the democratic years, has ground to a stop under the republicans. federal budgetary outlays for education and health, old-age assistance and child care, slum clearance and resource development, and _ all the other great needs of our people have been mercilessly slashed from an annual rate of more than $ per capita under the democrats to $ per capita under the republicans,.a cut of percent. the failure of the republican budget-bal- ancers. during the republican fiscal years - as a whole, the deficits have averaged larger, and the surpluses smaller, than during the democratic fiscal years -, financial manipulation to the contrary notwithstanding. ’ democratic principles for full prosperity for all: () we repudiate the republican stunting of our economic growth, and we reassert. the princi- ples of the full employment act of ; campaign of () we pledge ourselves to achieve an honest and realistic balance of the federal budget in a “just and fully prosperous american economy; () we pledge ourselves to equitable tax re- visions and monetary policies designed to combine economic progress with economic justice. we condemn the republican use of our revenue and money systems to benefit the few at the expense of the vast majority of our people; () we pledge ourselves to work toward the reduction and elimination of poverty in america; () we pledge ourselves to full parity of in- come and living standards for agriculture; to strike off the shackles which the taft-hartley law has unjustly imposed on labor; and to foster the more rapid growth of legitimate business enter- prise by founding this growth upon the expanding consuming power.of the people; and () we pledge ourselves to expand world trade and to enlarge international economic coopera- tion, all toward the end of a more prosperous and more peaceful world. democratic goals to be achieved during four years of progress. by adhering to these prin- ciples, we shall strive to attain by the fol- lowing full prosperity objectives for all american families: () a billion dollar national economy in rea] terms; () an increase of percent or better in the average standard of living; () an increase in the annual income of american families, with special emphasis on those whose incomes are below $; () a determined drive toward parity of in- comes and living standards for those engaged in the vital pursuit of agriculture; (). the addition of all necessary classrooms for our primary and secondary schools; the con- struction of needed new homes, with a proper proportion devoted to the rehousing of low- and middle-income families in urban and rural areas; the increase of benefits under the old age assist- ance and old age survivors insurance pro- grams; a substantial expansion in hospital facilities and medical research; and a doubling of our pro- grams for resource development and conservation; and () national defense outlays based upon our national needs, not permitting false economy to jeopardize our very survival. this country of ours, in the factory, in business national party platforms and on the farm, is blessed with ever-increasing productive power. the republicans have not per- mitted this potential abundance to be released for the mutual benefit of all. we reject this stunted republican concept of america. we pledge our- selves to release the springs of abundance, to bring this abundance to all, and thus to fulfill the full promise of america. these are our democratic goals for the next four years. we set them forth in vivid contrast to republican lip-service protestations that they, too, are for these goals. their little deeds belie their large and hollow slogans. our performance in the past gives validity to our goals for. the future. our victory in will make way for the commencement of these four years of progress. ill. free enterprise “equal rights for all and special privileges for none,” the tested jeffersonian principle, remains today the only philosophy by which human rights can be preserved by governnient. it is a sad fact in the history of the republican party that, under its control, our government has always become an instrument of special privilege; not a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. we have had, instead, under harding, coolidge and hoover, and now. under eisenhower, government of the many, by the few, and for the few. . we recognize monopolies and monopolistic practices as the real barriers between the people and their economic and political freedom. monop- olies act to stifle equality of opportunity and prevent the infusion of fresh blood into the life- stream of our economy. the republican ad- ministration has allowed giant corporate entities to dominate our economy. for example, forty thousand automobile dealers now know they were incapable of coping with these giants. they were, as the democratic 84th congress found, sub- jected to abuse and threatened with extinction. the’ result was passage of the o’mahoney- celler bill giving the automobile dealers of america economic freedom. we enacted this law, and we pledge that it shall be retained upon the statute books as a monument to the demo- cratic party’s concern for small business. we pledge ourselves to the restoration of truly competitive conditions in american industry. affirmative action within the framework of american tradition will be taken to curb corporate mergers that would contribute to the growth of economic concentration. small and independent business. in contrast to the maladministration by the republican party of the federal program to assist small and inde- pendent business, we pledge ourselves— () to the strict and impartial enforcement of the laws originally fostered and strengthened by the democratic party and designed to prevent monopolies. and other concentrations of economic and financial power; and to enact legislation to close loopholes in the laws prohibiting price discrimination; () to tax relief for all small and independent businesses by fair and equitable adjustments in federal taxation which will encourage business expansion, and to the realistic application of the principle of graduated taxation to such corporate ‘income. an option should be provided to spread federal estate taxes over a period of years when an estate consists principally of the equity capital of a closely held small business; () to adoption of all practical means of making long- and short-term credit available to small'and independent businessmen at reasonable rates; () to the award of a substantially higher pro- portion of government contracts to independent small businesses, and to the award of a far larger percentage of military procurement, by value, after competitive bids rather than by negotiation behind closed doors. we severely condemn re- publican discrimination against small and inde- pendent business; () to replacement of the weak and ineffective republican conduct of the small business ad- ministration, and its reconstitution as a vigorous, independent agency which will advocate the cause of small and independent businessmen, and render genuine assistance in fulfilling their needs and solving their problems. we condemn the republican administration for its failure to serve this important segment of our economy. law enforcement. we pledge ourselves to the fair and impartial administration of justice. the republican administration has degraded the great powers of law enforcement. it has not used them in the service of equal justice under law, but for concealment, coercion, persecution, politi- cal advantage and special interests. merchant marine. in the interest of our na- tional security, and of the maintenance of american standards of wages and living, and in order that our waterborne overseas commerce shall not be unfairly discriminated against by _ low-cost foreign competition, we pledge our con- tinued encouragement and support of a strong and adequate american merchant marine. transportation. the public and national de- fense interests require the development and maintenance, under the competitive free enter- prise system, of a strong, efficient and financially sound system of common-carrier transportation by water, highway, rail, and air, with each mode enabled, through sound and intelligent exercise of regulatory powers, to realize its inherent eco- nomic advantages and to reflect its full competitive capabilities. public interest also requires, under reasonable standards, the admission of new licensees, where public convenience may be served, into the transport fields. we deplore the lack of enforcement of safety regulations for pro- tection of life and property under the present republican administration, and pledge strict en- forcement of such regulations. highways. we commend the foresight of the democratic 84th congress for its enactment of the greatest program in history for expansion of our highway network, and we congratulate it upon its rejection of the unsound, unworkable, inade- quate and unfair roads bill proposed by the _ present republican administration. in coopera- tion with state and local governments, we. will continue the programs developed and fostered under prior democratic administrations for plan- ning, coordinating, financing and encouraging the expansion of our national road and highway network so vital to defense and transportation in the motor age. we support expansion of farm-to- market roads. rivers and harbors. we pledge continued de- velopment of harbors and waterways as a vital segment of our transportation system. we de- nounce as capricious and arbitrary the eisen- hower pocket veto of the rivers and harbors bill, which heartlessly. deprived the people in many sections of our country of vitally needed public works. projects. iv. a macna cwharta for lasor labor-management relations. harmonious labor-management relations are productive of ‘good incomes for wage earners and conducive to campaign of rising output from our factories. we believe that, to the widest possible extent consistent with the public interest, management and labor should - determine wage rates and conditions of employ- ment through free collective bargaining. the taft-hartley act passed by the republi- can-dominated 80th congress seriously impaired this relationship as established in the wagner national labor relations act, enacted under the roosevelt administration. the wagner act pro- tected, encouraged and guaranteed the rights of workers to organize, to join unions of their own choice, and to bargain collectively through these unions without coercion. the vicious anti-union character of the taft- hartley act was expressly recognized by candi- date eisenhower during the election cam- paign. , at that time, he made a solemn promise to eliminate its unjust provisions and to enact a fair law. president eisenhower and his administration have failed utterly, however, to display any executive initiative or forcefulness toward keeping this pledge to the workers. he was further responsible for administratively amending taft- hartley into a more intensely anti-labor weapon by stacking the national labor relations board with biased pro-management personnel who, by administrative decision, transformed the act into a management weapon. one such decision re- moved millions of workers from the jurisdiction of the nlrb, which in many cases left them without protection of either state or federal legis- lation. - we unequivocally advocate repeal of the taft- hartley act.. the act must be repealed because state “right-to-work” laws have their genesis in its discriminatory anti-labor provisions. it must be repealed because its restrictive pro- visions deny the principle that national legislation based on the commerce clause of the constitution normally overrides conflicting state laws. the taft-hartley act has been proven to be inadequate, unworkable and unfair. it interferes in an arbitrary manner with collective bargaining, causing imbalance in the relationship between management and labor. upon return of our national government to the democratic party, a new legislative approach toward the entire labor-management problem will be adopted, based on past experience and the principles of the wagner national labor rela- national party platforms"" tions act and the. norris-la guardia anti-in- junction law. fair labor standards. we commend the action of the democratic 84th congress which raised the minimum wage from cents to $. an hour despite the strenuous objection of president eisenhower and the republicans in congress. however, the inadequacies of the minimum wage become apparent as the cost of living increases, and we feel it imperative to raise the minimum wage to at least $. an hour, in order to approxi- mate present-day needs more closely. we further pledge as a matter of priority to extend full protection of the fair labor standards act to all workers in industry engaged in, or affecting, interstate commerce. walsh-healey contracts act. we pledge re- : vision and honest administration of the walsh- healey act, to restore its effectiveness and useful- ness as an instrument for maintaining fair stand- ards of wages and hours for american workers. equal pay for equal work. we advocate legis- lation to provide equal pay for equal work, re- gardless of sex. the physically handicapped. the democratic party has always supported legislation to benefit the disabled worker. the physically handicapped have proved their value to government and_in- dustry. we pledge our continued support of legislation to improve employment opportunities of physically handicapped persons. migratory workers. we shall support legisla- tion providing for the protection and improvement of the general welfare of migratory workers. jobs for depressed areas. we pledge our party to support legislation providing for an effective program to promote industry and create jobs in depressed industrial and rural areas so that such areas may be restored to economic stability. v. agriculture - sustained national prosperity is dependent upon a vigorous agricultural economy. we condemn the defeatist attitude of the eisenhower administration in. refusing .to take effective action to assure the well-being of farm families.. we condemn its fear of abundance, its lack of initiative in developing domestic mar- kets, and its dismal failure to obtain for the american farmer his traditional and deserved share of the world market. its extravagant ex- penditure of money intended for agricultural benefit, without either direction or results, is a national calamity. the eisenhower administration has failed utterly to develop any programs to meet the desperate needs of farmers in the face of fantastic promises,.and it has sabotaged the progressive programs inherited from prior democratic ad- ministrations by failing to administer them properly in the interest either of farmers or of the nation as a whole. specifically, we denounce president eisen- hower’s veto of the constructive legislation pro- posed and passed by the democratic 84th con- gress to reverse the alarming fall of farm prices and restore farmers to a position of first-class economic citizenship in the sharing of benefits from american productive ability. we also condemn the republican administra- tion for its abandonment of the true principles of soil conservation and for its destruction of the soil conservation service. we pledge to support continued improvements in the soil bank program passed by the democratic 84th congress and originally opposed by president eisenhower and secretary ezra taft benson. we deplore the diversion of this conservation program into a. direct vote-buying scheme. farmers have had to struggle far three: and one-half years while their net farm income has fallen more than one billion dollars a year. their parity ratio, which under democratic adminis- trations had been percent or more during the eleven years prior to , dropped to as low as percent during the eisenhower administration, and the farmers’ share of the consumers’ food dollar shrank from cents in to as low as only cents. one stark fact stands out clearly for all to see—disastrously low farm prices and record high consumer prices vie with each other for the attention of responsible government. in a reduction of this incongruous spread lies the answer.to some of the most vexing problems of agricultural economics. in their courageous fight to save their homes and land, american farmers have gone deeper and deeper into debt. last year farmers’ mortgage indebtedness increased more than in any year in history with the exception of the year . the democratic party met similar situations forthrightly in the past with concrete remedial action. it takes legitimate pride in its consistent record of initiating and developing every con- structive program. designed to protect and con- serve the human and natural resources so vital to our rural economy. these programs enabled consumers. to obtain more abundant supplies of high-quality food and fiber at reasonable prices while maintaining adequate income for farmers and improving the level of family living in rural areas. in order to regain the ground lost during the eisenhower administration, and in order better to serve both consumers and producers, the demo- cratic party pledges continuous and vigorous support to the following policies: sponsor a positive and comprehensive program to conserve our soil, water and forest resources for future generations; promote programs which will protect and preserve the family-type farm as a bulwark of american life, and encourage farm-home owner- ship, including. additional assistance to family farmers and young farmers in the form of specially designed credit and price-support programs, technical aid, and enlarged soil conservation al- lowances. maintain. adequate reserves of agricultural commodities strategically situated, for national ‘security purposes. such stockpiles should be handled as necessary strategic reserves, so that farmers will not be penalized by depressed prices for their efficiency and diligence in producing abundance; promote international exchange of commodities by creating an international food reserve, foster- ing commodity agreements, and vigorously ad- ministering the foreign agricultural trade de- velopment and assistance act; undertake immediately by appropriate action to endeavor to regain the full percent of parity the farmers received under the democratic administrations. we will achieve this by means of supports on basic commodities at percent of parity and by means of commodity loans, direct purchases, direct payments to producers, market- ing agreements and orders, production adjust- ments, or a combination of these, including legis- lation, to bring order and stability into the relationship between the producer, the processor and the consumer; , develop practical measures for’ extending price campaign of supports to feed grains and other nonbasic storables and to the producers of perishable com- modities such as meat, poultry, dairy products and the like; inaugurate a-food-stamp or other supplemental food program administered by appropriate state or local agencies to insure that no needy family shall be denied an adequate and wholesome diet because of low income; continue and expand school lunch and special milk programs to meet the dietary needs of all school children; increase the distribution of food to public institutions and organizations and qualified private charitable agencies, and increase the distribution of food and fiber to needy people in other nations through recognized charitable and religious ‘channels; devise and employ effective means to reduce the spread between producers’ prices and con- sumers’ costs, and improve market facilities and marketing practices; expand the program of agricultural research and education for better distribution, preserva- tion and marketing of farm products to serve both producers and consumers, and promote increased industrial use of farm surpluses; provide for an increased reservoir of farm credit at lower rates, designed purticularly. to accommodate operators of small family-type farms, and extend crop insurance to maximum coverage and protection; return the administration of farm programs to farmer-elected committeemen, eliminate the deplorable political abuses in federal employment in many agricultural counties as practiced by the eisenhower administration, and restore leadership to the administration of soil conservation districts; insure reliable and low-cost rural electric and telephone service; exercise authority in existing law relating to imports of price-supported agricultural commodi- ties in raw, manufactured or processed form as part of our national policy to minimize damage to our domestic economy; encourage bona fide farm cooperatives which help farmers reduce the cost-price squeeze, and protect such cooperatives against punitive tax- ation; , expand farm forestry marketing research and price reporting on timber products, and provide national party platforms | adequate credit designed to meet the needs of timber farmers; and enact a comprehensive farm program which, under intelligent and sympathetic democratic administration, will make the rural homes of america better and healthier places in which to live. vi. general welfare the democratic party believes that america can and must adopt measures to assure every citizen an opportunity for a full, healthy and happy life. to this end, we pledge ourselves to the expansion and improvement of the great social welfare programs inaugurated under demo- cratic administrations. social security. by lowering the retirement age for women and for disabled persons, the democratic 84th congress pioneered two great advances in’ social security, over the bitter opposition of the eisenhower administration. we shall continue our efforts to broaden and strengthen this program by increasing benefits to keep pace with improving standards of living; by raising the wage base upon which benefits depend; and by increasing benefits for each year of covered employment. unemployment insurance. we shall continue to work for a stronger unemployment insurance system, with broader coverage and increased benefits consistent with rising earnings. we shall also work for the establishment of a floor to assure minimum level and duration of benefits, and fair eligibility rules. wage losses due to illness. in , a demo- cratic congress enacted an insurance program to protect railroad workers against temporary wage losses due to short-term illnesses. because this program has worked so effectively, we favor ex- tending similar protection to other workers. public assistance. we pledge improvements in the public assistance program even beyond those enacted by the democratic 84th congress, through increased aid for the aged, the blind, dependent children, the disabled and other needy persons who are not adequately protected by our contributory insurance programs. additional needs of our senior citizens. to meet the needs of the million americans aged or over, we pledge ourselves to seek means of assuring these citizens greater income through expanded opportunities for employment, vo- cational retraining and adult: education; better - housing and health services for the aged; re- habilitation of the physically and mentally dis- abled to restore them to independent, productive lives; and intensified medical and other research aimed both at lengthening life and making the longer life more truly livable. health and medical care. the strength of our nation depends on the health of our people. the shortage of trained medical and health personnel and facilities has impaired american health stand- ards and has increased the cost of hospital care beyond the financial capacities of most american families. we pledge ourselves to initiate programs of: federal financial aid, without federal controls, for medical education. we pledge continuing and increased support for hospital construction programs, as well as in- creased federal aid to public health services, particularly in rural] areas. medical research. mindful of the dramatic progress made by medical research in recent years, we shall continue to support vigorously all efforts, both public and private, to wage relentless war on diseases which afflict the bodies and minds -of men. we commend the democratic party for its leadership in obtaining greater congressional authorizations in this field. housing. we pledge our party to immediate revival of the basic housing program enacted by the democratic congress in , to expansion of this program as our population and resources grow, and to additional legislation to provide housing for middle-income families and aged persons.. aware of the financial burdens which press upon most american communities and pre- vent them from taking full advantage of federal urban redevelopment and renewal programs, we favor increasing the federal share of the cost of these programs. we reaffirm the goal expressed by a democratic congress in that every american family is entitled to a “decent home and a suitable living environment.” the republican administration has sabotaged that goal by reducing the public housing program to a fraction of the nation’s need, we pledge that the housing insurance and mortgage guarantee programs will be redirected in the interest of the home owner, and that the availability of low-interest housing credit will be kept consistent with the expanding housing needs of the nation. we favor providing aid to urban and suburban communities in better planning for their future development and redevelopment. education. every american child, irrespective of race or national origin, economic status or place of residence, has full right under the law and the constitution, without discrimination, to -every educational opportunity for developing his potentialities. we are now faced with shortages of educa- tional facilities that threaten national security, economic prosperity and human well-being. the: resources of our states and localities are already strained to the limit. federal aid and action should be provided, within the traditional frame- work of state and local control. we pledge the democratic party to the follow- ing: () legislation providing federal financing to assist states and local communities to build schools, and to: provide essential health and safety services for all school children; () better educational, health and welfare opportunities for children of migratory workers; () assistance to programs for training teach- ers of exceptional children; () programs providing for the. training of teachers to meet the critical shortage in technical and scientific fields; and () expansion of the program of student, teacher and cultural exchange with other nations. vocational education. we commend the 84th congress for voting the maximum authorized funds for vocational education under the smith- hughes act for the first time in the history of the act. we pledge continuing and increased support of vocational training for youth and adults, in- cluding aid ‘to the states and localities for area technical-vocational schools. child welfare. to keep pace with the growing need for child care and welfare, we pledge an expanded program of grants to the states. we pledge continued support of adequate day care centers to care for the children of the millions of american mothers who work to help support their families. aid to the physically handicapped. there are campaign of today several million physically handicapped citi- zens, many of whom could become self-supporting if given the opportunity and training for rehabili- — tation. we pledge support to a vastly expanded rehabilitation program for these physically handi- capped, including increased aid to the states, in contrast to the grossly inadequate action of the republican administration. vii. frnanciat poricy tax adjustment. a fully expanding economy can yield enough tax revenues to meet the ines- capable obligations of government, balance the federal budget, and lighten the tax burden. the immediate need is to correct the inequities in the _ tax structure which reflect the republican de- termination to favor the few: at the expense of the many. we favor realistic tax adjustments, giving first consideration to small independent business and’ the small individual taxpayer. lower-income families need tax relief; only a democratic victory will assure this. we favor an increase in the present personal tax exemption of $ to a minimum of at least $. debt management. the republican debt management policy of higher interest rates serves only to benefit a few to the detriment of the general taxpayer, the small borrower, and the small and middle-class investor in government bonds. we pledge ourselves to a vigilant review of our debt management policy in order to reduce interest rates in the service of our common wel- fare. protection of investors. effective administra- tion of the federal securities laws has been under- mined by republican appointees with conflicting interests. . millions of investors who have bought securities with their savings are today without adequate protection. we favor vigorous ad- ministration and revision of the laws to provide investor safeguards for securities extensively . traded in the over-the-counter market, for foreign securities distributed in the united states, and against proxy contest. abuses. viii. government operations the democratic party pledges that it will re- turn the administration of our national govern- ment to a sound, efficient, and honest basis. civil service and federal employee relations. the eisenhower administration has failed either national party platforms to understand or trust the federal employee. its record in personnel management constitutes a grave indictment of policies reflecting prejudices and excessive partisanship to the detriment of employee morale. intelligent and sympathetic programs must be immediately undertaken to insure the re-establish- ment of the high morale and efficiency which were characteristic of the federal worker during years of democratic administrations. to accomplish these objectives, we propose: () protection and extension of the merit sys- tem through the enactment of laws to specify the rights and responsibilities of workers; () a more independent civil service com- mission in order that it may provide the intelli- gent leadership essential in perfecting a. proper civil service system; () promotion within the federal service under laws assuring advancement on merit and proven ability; () salary increases of a nature that will insure a truly competitive scale at all levels of employ- ment; () recognition by law of the right of em- ployee organizations to represent their members and to participate in the formulation and im- provement of personnel policies and practices; and () a fair and non-political loyalty program, by law, which will protect the nation against ' subversion and the employee against unjust and un-american treatment. restoring the efficiency of the postal service. the bungling policies of the republican adminis- tration have crippled and impaired the morale, efficiency and reputation of the u.s. postal serv- ice. mail carriers and clerks and other postal employees are compelled to work under intoler- able conditions. communication by mai] and service by parcel post have been delayed and retarded with resulting hardships, business losses and inconveniences. a false concept of economy - has impaired seriously the efficiency of the best communication system in the world. we pledge ourselves to programs which will: () restore the principle that the postal serv- ice is a public service to be operated in the interest of improved business economy and better commumication, as well as an aid to the dissemi- nation of information and intelligence; () restore postal employee morale through the strengthening of the merit system, with pro- motions by law rather than. caprice or partisan politics, and payment of realistic salaries reflect- ing the benefits of an expanded economy; () establish a program of research and de- velopment on a scale adequate to insure the most modern and efficient handling of the mails; and () undertake modernization and construc- tion of desperately needed postal facilities de- signed to insure the finest postal system in the world. selfish manipulation have characterized federal administration during the eisenhower years. taxpayers, paying billions of dollars each year to their government, demand and must have the highest standards of honesty, integrity and efficiency as a minimum requirement of federal executive conduct. we pledge a strong merit system as a ‘substitute for cynical policies of spoils and special favor which are now the rule of the day. we seek the constant improvement of the federal government apparatus to accomplish these ends. under certain conditions, we recognize the need for the employment of personnel without compensation in ‘the executive branch of the government. but the privileges extended these dollar-a-year men have resulted in grave abuses of power. some of these representatives of large corporations ‘have assumed a dual loyalty to the government and to the corporations that pay them. these abuses under the republican .ad- ministration have been scandalous. the demo- cratic party proposes that any necessary use of non-compensated employees shall be made only after the most careful scrutiny and under the most rigidly prescribed safeguards to prevent any conflict of interests. freedom of information.. during recent years there has developed a practice on the part of federal agencies to delay and withhold informa- tion which is needed by congress and the general public to make important decisions affecting their lives and destinies. we believe that this trend toward secrecy in government should be reversed and that the federal government should return to its basic tradition of exchanging and | promoting the freest flow of information possible in those unclassified areas where secrets involving weapons development and bona fide national * conflict of interests. maladministration and security are not involved. we condemn the eisenhower administration for the excesses prac- ticed in this vital area, and pledge the demo- cratic party to reverse this tendency, substituting a rule of law for that of broad claims of executive privilege. we reaffirm our position of “to ‘press strongly for world-wide freedom in the gathering and dissemination of news.” we shall press for free access to information throughout the world for our journalists and scholars. clean elections. the shocking disclosures in the last congress of attempts by selfish interests to exert improper influence on members of con- gress have resulted in a congressional investiga- tion now under way. the democratic party pledges itself to provide effective regulation and full disclosure of campaign expenditures . and contributions in elections to federal offices. equal rights amendment. we of the demo- cratic party recommend and. irdorse for sub- mission to the congress a constitutional amend- ment providing equal rights for women. veterans administration. we are spending approximately billion dollars per year on veterans’ benefits. there are more than million veterans in civil life today and approximately million veterans or dependents of deceased veterans drawing. direct cash benefits from the veterans administration. it is clear that a matter of such magnitude demands more prominence in the affairs of government. we pledge that we will elevate the veterans administration to a place of dignity commensurate with its importance in national affairs. we charge the present administration with open hostility toward the veterans’ hospital program as disclosed by its efforts to restrict severely that program in fiscal year . we further charge the administration with incompe-- tence and gross neglect in the handling of veterans’ benefits in the following particulars: () the refusal to allow service connection for disabilities incurred in or aggravated by military service, and the unwarranted reduction of disa- bility evaluations in cases where service connection has been allowed; and () the failure to give proper protection to veterans purchasing homes under the va home loan program both by inadequate supervision of the program and, in some instances, by active campaign of cooperation with unscrupulous builders, lenders and real estate brokers. in recognition of the valiant efforts of those who served their nation in its gravest hours, we pledge: () continuance of the veterans administra- tion as an independent federal agency handling veterans programs; () continued recognition of war veterans, with adequate compensation for the service-con- nected disabled and for the survivors of those who have passed away in service or from service- incurred disabilities; and with pensions for dis- abled and distressed veterans, and for the de- pendents of those who have passed on, where they are in need or unable to provide for them- selves; () maintenance of the veterans administra- tion hospital system, with no impairment in the high quality of medical and hospital service; () priority of hospitalization for the service- connected disabled, and the privilege of hospital care when beds are available for the non-service- connected illness of veterans who are sick and without funds or unable to procure private hospi- talization; () fair administration of veterans preference jaws, and employment opportunities for handi- . capped and disabled veterans; () full hearings for war veterans filing valid applications with the review, corrective and settle- ment boards of the federal government; and () support for legislation to obtain an exten- sion of the current law to enable veterans to ob- tain homes and farms through the continuance of the gi loan program. statehood for alaska and hawaii. we condemn the republican administration for its utter disre- gard of the rights to statehood of both alaska and hawaii. these territories have contributed greatly to our national economic and cultural life and are vital to our defense. they. are part of america and should be recognized as.such. we of the democratic party, therefore, pledge im- mediate statehood for these two territories. we commend these territories for the action their people have taken in the adoption of constitutions which will become effective forthwith when they are admitted into the union. puerto rico. the democratic party views with satisfaction the progress and growth achieved by § national party platforms puerto rico since its political organization as a commonwealth under democratic party leader- ship. we pledge, once again, our continued sup- port of the commonwealth and its development and growth along lines of increasing responsi- bility and authority, keeping as functions of the federal government only such as are essential to the existence of the compact of association adopted by the congress of the united states and the people of puerto rico. the progress of puerto rico under common- wealth status has been notable proof of the great benefits which flow from self-government and the good neighbor policy which under demo- cratic leadership this country has always fol- lowed. — virgin islands. we favor increased self-govern- ment for the virgin islands to provide for an elected governor and a resident commissioner in the congress of the united states. we de- nounce the scandalous administration of the first eisenhower-appointed governor of the virgin islands. other territories and possessions. we favor in- creased self-government for guam, other out- lying territories and the trust territory of the pacific. district of columbia. we favor immediate home rule and ultimate national representation for the district of columbia. american indians. recognizing that all american indians are citizens of the united states and of the states in which they reside, and acknowledging that the federal government has a unique legal and moral responsibility for indians which is imposed by the constitution and spelled out in treaties, statutes and court decisions, we pledge: prompt adoption of a federal program to assist indian tribes in the full development of their human and natural resources, and to advance the health, education and economic well-being of indian citizens, preserving their traditions with- out impairing ‘their cultural heritage; no alteration of any treaty or other federal- indian ‘contractual relationships without the free consent of the indian tribes concerned; reversal of the present policies which are tending toward erosion of indian rights, reduction of their eco- nomic base through alienation of their lands, and repudiation of federal responsibility; prompt and expeditious settlement of indian claims against the united states, with full recog- nition of the rights of both parties; and elimination of all impediments to full citizen- ship for american indians. governmental balance. the democratic party has upheld its belief in the constitution as a charter of individual rights, an effective instru- ment for human progress. democratic adminis- trations placed upon the statute books during their last years a multitude of measures which testify to our belief in the jeffersonian principle of local control even in general legislation in- volving nation-wide programs. selective service, social security, agricultural adjustment, low- rent housing, hospital, and many other legislative programs have placed major responsibilities in. states and counties, and provide fine examples of how benefits.can be extended through federal- state cooperation. while we recognize the existence of honest differences of opinion as to the true location of the constitutional line of demarcation between the federal government and the states, the democratic party expressly recognizes the vital importance of the respective states in our federal. union. the party of jefferson and jackson pledges itself to continued support of those sound princi- ples of local government which will best serve the welfare of our people and the safety of our democratic rights. improving congressional: procedures. in order that the will of the american people may. be expressed upon all legislative proposals, we urge that action be taken at the beginning of the 85th congress to improve congressional procedures so that majority rule prevails and decisions can be made after reasonable debate without being blocked. by a minority in either house. ix. narural resources our national economic strength and welfare’ depend primarily upon the development of our land, water, mineral and energy resources, with which this nation has been abundantly blessed. we pledge unstinting support to a full and integrated program of development, protection, management and conservation of all of our natural resources for all of the people. the framework of time-tested conservation and mining policy is fixed in laws under which america has developed its natural resources for the general welfare. . the democratic 84th congress has remained steadfast to this traditional policy. it has built upon the tremendous conservation and develop- ment achievements of the roosevelt and. truman administrations by undertaking the greatest pro- gram of natural resources development ever assumed by any congress in our nation’s history. this constructive democratic record, em- bracing all resources of land, water, energy and minerals, is in sharp contrast to the faithless per- formance of the eisenhower administration which has despoiled future generations of their heritage by utter failure to safeguard natural resources. our people will long remember this betrayal of their heritage as symbolized by the infamous dixon-yates contract; the al sarena timber scheme; the low-level hells canyon dams; and for its unreasonable resistance to authorizing the niagara project which would benefit so many millions in the state of new york and adjacent areas. we condemn, and will continue to decry, this pillaging of our dwindling natural resource wealth through political manipulation and administrative subversion by the eisenhower administration. we pledge ourselves to halt this betrayal of the people’s trust. we shall devise for the american people a dynamic, far-reaching and progressive conserva- tion program. the democratic party proposes, and will strive to secure, this comprehensive resources program for america’s future. land. our land will be preserved and improved for the present and future needs of our people, and not wastefully exploited to benefit special- interest groups. soil conservation. in contrast to the wasteful neglect of the present administration, soil conser- vation practices will be stimulated and intensified to reduce land deterioration under the vital soil conservation service assistance program con- ceived and fostered by the democratic party. national parks, recreation and wildlife. we pledge adoption of an immediate and broad policy to mobilize the efforts of private and public agencies for protection ‘of existing recreational areas, provision of new ones, and improvement of inadequate facilities. slum conditions fostered campaign of by republican neglect are intolerable to the tens of millions of americans using our national parks and forests. democratic administration will end this shocking situation. fish and game habitats will be guarded against encroachment for commercial purposes. all river basin development plans will take into full con- sideration their effect upon fish, wildlife, national . park and wilderness areas. the fish and wildlife service must and will be returned to the career status from which it was removed by the political patronage policy of the present administration. _ recreational facilities for the millions of field and stream sportsmen of america will be con- served and expanded. forest and grazing lands. timber on federal commercial forest lands will be harvested and managed on a sustained-yield basis. we propose to increase forest access roads in order to improve cutting practices on both public -and private lands. private owners of farm, forest and range lands need and must have financial and technical assist- ance so that all lands will be utilized to contribute more fully to the national welfare by production of food and fiber and protection of our water- sheds. any effort to transform grazing permits from a revocable license to a vested right will be rejected. we will vigorously advocate federally-financed forestation, upstream erosion control and flood control programs on our public range, timber lands and small drainage basins to protect our watersheds and double the rate of forage and commercial timber growth. we will promote co- operative programs with government assistance to reduce timber losses from fire, insects, and disease. prospecting and mining on unreserved federal lands will be encouraged, but surface areas not needed in mining will be safeguarded by ap- propriate legislation. water. we pledge the resumption of rapid and orderly multiple-purpose river basin develop- ment throughout the country. this program will bring into reality the full potential benefits of flood control, irrigation and our domestic and municipal water supply from surface and under- ground waters. it will also materially aid low- cost power, navigation, recreation, fish and wild- life propagation and mineral development. we | ‘ national party platforms pledge our aid to the growing requirements of the semiarid western states for an adequate water ‘supply to meet the vital domestic, irrigation and industrial: needs of the rapidly growing urban centers. enhanced regional economies will strengthen the economy of the nation as a whole. we will take appropriate and vigorous steps to prevent comprehensive drainage basin develop- ment plans from being fragmented by single- purpose projects. the conservation of water is essential to the life of the nation. the demo- cratic party pledges itself to conservation of water in the public interest. : the democratic 84th congress has taken a long step toward reducing the pollution of our rivers and streams. we pledge continuation and expansion of this program, vital to every citizen. the program of obtaining a large new source of fresh water supply from salt water was begun by the democratic party, but has been allowed to lapse by the eisenhower republican ‘ad- ministration. it will be resumed and accelerated. energy. we pledge ourselves to carry forward, under national policy, aggressive programs to pro- vide abundant supplies of low-cost energy, in- cluding continued research for the development of synthetic liquid fuel from coal, shale and agricultural products. these we must have to feed: our insatiable industrial economy, to enable our workers to develop their skills and increase their productivity, to provide more jobs at higher wages, to meet the ever-mounting demands for domestic and farm uses, including the production of lower-cost farm fertilizers and lower-cost power to consumers. we will carry forward increased and full production of hydroelectric power on our rivers and of steam generation for the tennessee valley authority to meet its peacetime and defense re- quirements. such self-liquidating projects must go forward in a rapid and orderly manner, with appropriate financing plans. integrated regional transmission systems will enhance exchange of power and encourage diversified industrial de- velopment. we shall once more rigorously enforce the anti-monopoly and public body preference clauses, including the holding company act, administra- tively circumvented by the eisenhower republi- can administration. we shall. preserve and strengthen the public power competitive yard- } stick in power developments under tva, rea, bureau of reclamation, bonneville, southeast and southwest power administrations and other future projects, including atomic power plants, under a policy of the widest possible use of electric energy at the lowest possible cost. minerals. the republican administration has seriously neglected and ignored one of the nation’s basic industries, metal mining. we recognize that a healthy mining industry is essen- © tial to the economy of the nation, and therefore pledge immediate efforts toward the establish- ment of a realistic, long-range minerals policy. the nation’s. minerals and fuels are essential to the safety, security and development of our coun- try. we pledge the adoption of policies which will further encourage the exploration and de- velopment of additional reserves of our mineral resources, domestic fisheries. we will undertake compre- hensive scientific and economic research programs for the conservation and better utilization of, and new markets for, fishery products. we favor and will encourage reciprocal world trade in fish products. we pledge ourselves to a public works and water policy providing adequate protection for domestic fishery resources. we favor treaties with other nations for conser- vation and better utilization of international fisheries. scenic resources. to the end that the scenic beauty of our land may be preserved and main- tained for this and future generations to enjoy, we pledge accelerated support of educational programs to stimulate individual responsibility and pride in clean, attractive surroundings—from big cities to rural areas. x. atomic energy the atomic era came into being and was de- veloped under democratic administrations. the genius of american scientists, engineers and workmen, supported by the vision and cour- age of franklin d. roosevelt, made possible the splitting of the atom and the development of the first atomic bomb in time to end world war ii. with the ending of the war, the supremacy of _ america in atomic weapons was maintained under the leadership of president truman, and the united states pushed ahead. vigorously toward utilizirig this new form of energy in peaceful pursuits, particularly in the fields of medicine, agriculture and industry. by the end of the truman administration, the pre-eminence of the united states in the nuclear field was clearly established, and we were on the threshold of large-scale development of industrial nuclear energy at home and-as an instrument of world peace. the eisenhower administration promptly reversed the field and plunged the previously independent and nonpartisan atomic energy commission into partisan politics. for example, president eisenhower ordered the commission to sign the scandalous dixon-yates contract. he was later forced to repudiate the same contract, after the exposure of the illegal activities of one of his own consultants with a secret office in the bureau of the budget. the republican administration has followed the same pattern in the field of atomic energy that it has pursued in its treatment of other natural resources—lofty words, little action, but steady service to selfish interests. while the aec and the special private interests consult and confer, the united states is lagging instead of leading in the world race for nuclear power, inter- national prestige and world markets, the democrats in congress believed that the national interest thus became imperiled, and they moved to meet the challenge both at home and abroad. they established’a nonpartisan panel of eminent americans to study the impact of the peaceful atom. following the comprehensive report of this panel, the joint congressional committee on ' atomic energy held extensive hearings on bills to accelerate the atomic reactor demonstration program. though the bills were reported unani- mously from committee, the republican members | of congress, under heavy pressure from the white house,. insured the final defeat of this legislation in the congress. but the fight to bring. nuclear power to the people has only begun. as the united states was first in the development of the atom .as a weapon, so the united states must lead in bring- ing the blessings of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy to mankind. hence, the democratic party pledges itself: () to restore nonpartisan administration of campaign of the vital atomic energy program and to expand and accelerate nuclear development by vigorous action: () to accelerate the domestic civilian atomic power program by the construction of a variety of demonstration prototype reactors; () to give reality—life and meaning—to the “atoms for peace” program. we will substitute deeds for words; (a) to increase the production of fissionable material for use in a stockpile for peacetime commitments at home and abroad,. and for an ever-present reserve for weapons to guarantee freedom in the world; () to. conduct a comprehensive survey of radiation hazards from bomb tests and reactor operations, in order to determine what additional measures are required to protect existing and future generations from these invisible dangers;- and () to make the maximum contribution to the defense of our nation and the free world through the development of a balanced and flexible stockpile of nuclear weapons, containing a sufficient number and variety to support our armed services in any contingency. xi. crvit ricuts the democratic party is committed to support and advance the individual rights and liberties of all americans. our country is founded on the proposition that all men are created equal. this means that all citizens are equal before the law and should enjoy all political rights. they should have equal opportunities for education, for economic advancement, and for decent living conditions. ; we will continue our efforts to eradicate discrimination based on race, religion or national origin. we know this task requires action, not just in one section of the nation, but in all sections. it requires the cooperative efforts of individual citizens, and action by state and local governments, it also requires federal action. the federal government must live up to the ideals of the declaration of independence and must exercise the powers vested in it by the constitu- tion. we are proud of the record of the democratic party in securing equality of treatment and oppor- tunity in the nation’s armed forces, the civil national party platforms service, and in all areas under federal jurisdiction. the democratic party pledges itself to continue its efforts to eliminate illegal discriminations. of all kinds, in relation to () full rights to vote, () full rights to engage in gainful occupations, () full rights to enjoy security of the person, and () full rights to education. in all publicly sup- ported institutions. ‘recent decisions of the supreme court of the united states relating to segregation in publicly supported schools and elsewhere have brought consequences of vast importance to our nation as a whole and especially to communities directly affected. we reject all proposals for the use of force to interfere with the orderly determination of these matters by the courts. the democratic party emphatically reaffirms its support of the historic principle that ours is a government of laws and not of men; it recognizes the supreme court of the united states as one of the three constitutional and coordinate branches of the federal government, superior to and separate from any political party, the de- cisions of which are part of the law of the land. we condemn the efforts of the republican party to make it appear that this tribunal is a part of the republican party. we condemn the republican administration’s violation of the rights of government employees by a heartless and unjustified confusing of “se- curity” and “loyalty” for the sole purpose. of political gain and regardless of consequences to individual victims and to the good name of the united states. we condemn the republican administration’s misrepresentation of facts and violation of individual rights in a wicked and unprincipled attempt to degrade and destroy the democratic party, and to make political capital for the republican party. prohibition party platform for preamble we, the representatives of the prohibition party, assembled in national convention at camp mack, milford, indiana, september , , and , , recognizing almighty god as the source of all just government and with faith in the teach- ings of the prince of peace, do solemnly promise that, if our party is chosen to administer the affairs of the nation, we will carefully use all the powers of our administration to preserve the rights, privileges and basic freedoms of the people of the united states. constitutional government we solemnly affirm our loyalty to the consti- tution of the united states, to the principles of liberty enunciated in our declaration of inde- pendence and in the preamble and bill of rights of our constitution, our deep confidence in our form of government, and our earnest desire to serve our people with a constructive program based upon the principles of righteousness and democracy. we are unalterably opposed to any form of totalitarianism. we challenge all loyal citizens to work against this menace to civilization. we believe that the best safeguard against these dangerous doctrines is to preserve the rights of our citizens by enforcing the provisions of the constitution and the bill of rights. we deplore the actions of any administration in exceeding its authority, through executive agreements, thereby violating the constitutional prerogatives of our legislative bodies. wor.p peace we, in this age of atomic and hydrogen bombs (capable of destroying civilization) pledge our- selves to search for peaceful solutions of inter- national conflicts, under an international “good neighbor” policy, call for an immediate outlawing of all weapons. of annihilation, propose a pro- gressive multi-lateral limitation of armaments and their ultimate abolition, leading to world peace and the brotherhood of man. militarism we are opposed to the militarization of our youth, through universal military training, uni- versal conscription, or universal reserve’ service. economic aid ’ our government should give much greater emphasis to relief, rehabilitation and economic aid, especially for technical assistance, to help the people raise their own standard of living in the underdeveloped areas where widespread hunger and human misery now prepare the soil for communist propaganda.","['campaign',

‘An administration pledged to the above pro-
gram is essential for effective steps toward solv-
ing this important problem.

CONCLUSION

What is needed is a re-alignment of voters and
the union ef zood citizens in a party which will
support oniv candidates of unquestioned in-
tewrity and competence, who will faithfully serve
the commonwealth and set a good example of
pubhe and private morality, and who are com-
mitted to the principles of this platform.

We urge all who believe in these principles to
vote their convictions and help us achieve a
clean, honest and humane government “of the
people. by the people, and for the people,” under
God.

Republican Platform 1956
DECLARATION OF FAITH

America’s trust is in the merciful providence
of God. in whose image every man is created . . .
the source of every man’s dignity and freedom.

In this trust our Republic was founded. We
give devoted homage to the Founding Fathers.
They not only proclaimed that the freedom and
rights of men came from the Creator and not from
the State. but they provided safeguards to those
freedoms.

Our Government was created by the people
for all the people, and it must serve no less a
purpose.

The Republican Party was formed 100 years
ago to preserve the Nation’s devotion to these
ideals.

On its Centennial, the Republican Party again
calls to the minds of all Americans the great
truth first spoken by Abraham Lincoln: “The
legitimate object of Covernment is to do for a
community of people whatever they need to have
done but cannot do at all, or cannot so well do,
for themselves in their separate and individual
capacities. But in all that people can individually
do as well for themselves, Government ought not
to interfere.” ’

Our great President Dwight D. Eisenhower
has counseled us further: “In all those things
which deal with people, be liberal, be human. In
all those things which deal with people’s money,

CAMPAIGN OF 1956 545

ev their economy, or their form of government,
be conservative.”

While jealously guarding the free institutions
nd preserving the principles upon which our
Republic was founded and has flourished. the
purpose of the Republican Party is to establish
and maintain a peaceful world and build at home
a dynamic prosperity in which every citizen
fairly shares. .

We shall ever build anew, that our children
and their children, without distinction because of
race, creed or color, may know the blessings of
our free land.

We believe that busic to governmental integrity
are unimpeachable ethical standards and_ irre-
proachable personal conduct by all people in
government. We shall continue our insistence
on honesty as an indispensable requirement. of
public service. We shall continue to root out
corruption whenever and wherever it appears.

We are proud of and shall continue our far-
reaching and sound advances in matters of basic
human needs — expansion of social security —
broadened coverage in unemployment insurance
—improved housing—and better health protection
for all our people. We are determined that our
government remain warmly responsive to the
urgent social and economic problems of our
people.

To these beliefs we commit ourselves as we
present this record and declare our goals for the
future.

Nearly four years ago when the peorle of
this Nation entrusted their Government to Presi-
dent Eisenhower and the Republican Party, we
were locked in a costly and stalemated war. Now
we have an honorable peace, which has stopped
the bitter toll in casualties and resources, ended
depressing wartime restraints, curbed the run-
away inflation and unleashed the boundless
energy of our people to forge forward on the road
to progress.

In four years we have achieved the highest
economic level with the most widely shared
benefits that the world has ever seen. We of the
Republican Party have fostered this prosperity
and are dedicated to its expansion and to the
preservation of the climate in which it has thrived.

We are proud of our part in bringing into a
position of unique authority in the world one who
symbolizes, as can no other man, the hopes of all


546 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

peoples for peace, liberty and justice. One leader
in the world today towers above all others and
inspires the trust, admiration, confidence and
good will of all the peoples of every nation—
Dwight D. Eisenhower. Under his leadership,
the Republican Administration has carried out
foreign policies which have enabled our people
to enjoy in peace the blessings of liberty. We
shall continue to work unceasingly for a just and
enduring peace in a world freed of tyranny.

Every honorable means at our command has
been exercised to alleviate the grievances and
causes of armed conflict among nations. The
advance of Communism and its enslavement of
people has been checked, and, at key points,
thrown back. Austria, Iran and Guatemala have
been liberated from Kremlin control. Forces of
freedom are at work ir. -he nations still enslaved
by Communist imperialism.

We firmly believe in the right of peoples
everywhere to determine their form of govern-
ment, their leaders, their destiny, in peace. Where
needed, in order to promote peace and freedom
throughout the world, we shall within the prudent
limits of our resources, assist friendly countries in
their determined efforts to strengthen their econo-
mies.

We hold high hopes for useful service to man-
kind in the power of the atom. We shall gener-
ously assist the International Atomic Energy
Agency, now evolving from President Eisenhower's
“Atoms for Peace” proposal, in an effort to find
ways to dedicate man’s genius not to his death,
but to his life.

We maintain that no treaty or international
agreement can deprive any of our citizens of
Constitutional rights. We shall see to it that no
treaty or agreement with other countries attempts
to deprive our citizens of the rights guaranteed
them by the Federal Constitution.

President Eisenhower has given the world
bold proposals for mutual arms reduction and
protection against aggression through flying
sentinels in an “open sky.”

We support this and his further offer of United
States participation in an international: fund for
economic development financed from the savings
brought by true disarmament. We approve his
determined. resistance to disarmament without
effective inspection.

We work and pray for the day when the

domination of any people from any source will
have ended, and when there will be liberation
and true freedom for the hundreds of millions
of individuals now held in subjugation. We shall
continue to dedicate our best efforts to this lofty
purpose.

We shall continue vigorously to support the
United Nations.

We shall continue to oppose the seating of
Communist China in the United Nations.

We shall maintain our powerful military
strength as a deterrent to aggression and as a
guardian of the peace. We shall maintain it ready,
balanced and technologically advanced for these
objectives only.

Good times in America have reached 2 breadth
and depth never before known by any nation.
Moreover, it is a prosperity of a nation at peace,
not at war. We shall continue to encourage the
good business and sound employee relationships
which have made possible for the first time in our
history a productive capacity of more than $400
billion a year. Nearly 67 million people have
full-time jobs, with real wages and personal in-
come at record highs.

The farmers of America are at last able to look
to the future with a confidence based on ex-
panding peacetime markets instead of on politi-
cally contrived formulas foredoomed to fail except
in a wartime economy. The objective is to insure
that agriculture shares fairly and fully in our
record prosperity without needless Federal med-
dlings and domination.

Restoration of integrity in government has
been an essential element to the achievement of
our unparalleled good times. We will faithfully
preserve the sound financial management which
already has reduced annual spending $14 billion
below the budgets planned by our Democratic
predecessors and made possible in 1954 a $7.4-
billion tax cut, the largest one-year tax reduction
in history.

We will ever fight the demoralizing influence
of inflation as a national way of life. We are
proud to have fulfilled our 1952 pledge to halt
the skyrocketing cost of living that in the previous
13 years had cut the value of the dollar by half,
and robbed millions of the full value of their
wages, savings, insurance, pensions and _ social
security.

We have balanced the budget. We believe

a res


and will continue to prove that thrift, prudence
and a sensible respect for living within income
applies as surely to the management of our Gov-
ernment’s budget as it does to the family budget.

We hold that the major world issue today is
whether Government shall be the servant or the
master of men. We hold that the Bill of Rights
is the sacred foundation of personal liberty. That
men are created equal needs no affirmation, but
they must have equality of opportunity and
protection of their civil rights under the law.

We hold that the strict division of powers and
the primary responsibility of State and local
governments must be maintained, and that the
centralization of powers in the national Govern-
ment leads to expansion of the mastery of our
lives.

We hold that the protection of the freedom of
men requires that budgets be balanced, waste in
government eliminated, and taxes reduced.

In these and all other areas of proper Govern-
ment concern, we pledge our best thought and
whole energy to a continuation of our prized
peace, prosperity and progress.

For our guidance in fulfilling this responsibility,
President Eisenhower has given us a statement of
principles that is neither partisan nor prejudiced,
but warmly American:

The individual is of supreme importance.

The spirit of our people is the strength of
our nation.

America does not prosper unless all Ameri-
cans prosper.

Government must have a heart as well as a
head.

Courage in principle, cooperation in practice
make freedom positive.

To stay free, we must stay strong.

Under God, we espouse the cause of free-
dom and justice and peace for all peoples.
Embracing these guides to positive, construc-

tive action, and in their rich spirit, we ask the
support of the American people for the election
of a Republican Congress and the re-election of
the Nation’s devoted and dedicated leader —
Dwight D. Eisenhower.

DECLARATION OF DETERMINATION

In the interest of complete public understand-
ing, elaboration of Republican aspirations and

CAMPAIGN OF 1956 547

achievements is desirable in the areas of broadest
public concern.

Dynamic EconoMy—FrEE LABOR

TAXATION AND Fiscat Powicy

The Republican Party takes pride in calling at-
tention to the outstanding fiscal achievements of
the Eisenhower Administration, several of which
are mentioned in the foreword to these resolu-
tions.

In order to progress further in correcting the
unfortunate results of unwise financial manage-
ment during 20 years of Democrat Administra-
tions, we pledge to pursue the following ob-
jectives:

Further reductions in Government spending
as recommended in the Hoover Commission Re-
port, without weakening the support of a superior
defense program or depreciating the quality of
essential services of government to our peuple.

Continued balancing of the budget, to assure
the financial strength of the country which is so
vital to the struggle of the free world in its battle
against Communism; and to maintain the pur-
chasing power of a sound dollar, and the value
of savings, pensions and insurance.

Gradual reduction of the national debt.

Then, insofar as consistent with a balanced
budget, we pledge to work toward these addi-
tional objectives:

Further reductions in taxes with particular
consideration for low and middle income [amikes.

Initiation of a sound policy of tax reductions
which will encourage small independent busi-
nesses to modernize and progress.

Continual study of additional ways to correct
inequities in the effect of various taxes.

Consistent with the Republican Administra-
tion’s accomplishment in stemming the inflation
—which under five Democrat Administrations
had cut the value of the dollar in half, and so
had robbed the wage earner and millions of
thrifty citizens who had savings. pensions and
insurance—we endorse the present policy of

_freedom for the Federal Reserve System to com-

bat both inflation and deflation by wise fiscal
policy.

The Republican Party believes that sound
money, which retains its buying power, is an
essential foundation for new jobs, a higher stand-

LABOR

Under the Republican Administration, as our
country has prospered, so have its people. This
is as it should be, for as President Eisenhower
said: “Labor is the United States. The men and
women, who with their minds, their hearts and
hands, create the wealth that is shared in this
country—they are America.”

The Eisenhower Administration has brought
to our people the highest employment, the high-
est wages and the highest standard of living ever
enjoyed by any nation. Today there are nearly
67 million men and women at work in the United
States, 4 million more than in 1952. Wages have
increased substantially over the past 32 years;
but. more important, the American wage earner
today can buy more than ever before for himself
and his family because .his pay check has not
been eaten away by rising taxes and soaring
prices.

The record of performance of the Republican
Administration on behalf of our working men and
women goes still further. The Federal minimum
wage has been raised for more than 2 million
workers. Social Security has been extended to an
additional 10 million workers and the benefits
raised for 6% million. The protection of unem-
ployment insurance has been brought to 4 million
additional workers. There have been increased
workmen’s compensation benefits for longshore-
men and harbor workers, increased retirement
benefits for railroad employees, and wage in-
creases and improved welfare and pension plans
for federal emplovees.

In addition, the Eisenhower Administration

has enforced more vigorously and effectively than.
ever before. the laws which protect the working
standards of our people.

Workers have benefited by the progress which
has been made in carrying out the programs and
principles set forth in the 1952 Republican plat-

CAMPAIGN OF 1956 549

form. All workers have gained and unions have
grown in strength and responsibility, and have
increased their membership by 2 millions.

Furthermore, the process of free collective
bargaining has been strengthened by the insist-
ence of this Administration that labor and man-
agement settle their differences at the bargaining
table without the intervention of the Government.
This policy has brought to our country an un-
precedented period of labor-management peace
and understanding.

We applaud the effective, unhindered, collective
bargaining which brought an early end to the
1956 steel strike, in contrast to the six months’
upheaval, Presidential seizure of the steel indus-
try and ultimate Supreme Court intervention
under the last Democrat Administration.

The Eisenhower Administration will continue
to fight for dynamic and progressive programs
which, among other things, will:

Stimulate improved job safety of our workers,
through assistance to the States, employees and
employers;

Continue and further perfect its programs of
assistance to the millions of workers with special
employment problems, such as older workers,
handicapped workers, members of minority
groups, and migratory workers;

Strengthen and improve the Federal-State Em-
ployment Service and improve the effectiveness
of the unemployment insurance system;

Protect by law, the assets of employee welfare
and benefit plans so that workers who are the
beneficiaries can be assured of their rightful
benefits;

Assure equal pay for equal work regardless of
sex;

Clarify and strengthen the eight-hour laws
for the benefit of workers who are subject to
federal wage standards on Federal and Federally-
assisted construction, and maintain and continue
the vigorous administration of the Federal pre-
vailing minimum wage law for public supply
contracts;

Extend the protection of the Federal minimum
wage laws to as many more workers as is possible
and practicable;

Continue to fight for the elimination of dis-
crimination in employment because of race, creed,
color, national origin, ancestry or sex;

Provide assistance to improve the economic

conditions of areas faced with persistent and sub-
stantial unemployment:

Revise and improve the Taft-Hartley Act so as
to protect more effectively the rights of labor
unions, management, the individual worker, and
the public. The protection of the right of workers
to organize into unions and to bargain collectively
is the firm and permanent policy of the Eisen-
hower Administration. In 1954, 1955 and again
in 1956, President Eisenhower recommended
constructive amendments to this Act. The Demo-
crats in Congress have consistently blocked these
needed changes by parliamentary maneuvers. The
Republican Party pledges itself to overhaul and
improve the Taft-Hartley Act along the lines of
these recommendations.

Human WELFARE AND ADVANCEMENT

HeaLtH, Epucation anp WELFARE

The Republican Party believes that the physi-
cal, mental. and spiritual well-being of the people
is as important as their economic health. It will
continue to support this conviction with vigorous
action.

Republican action created the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare as the first new
Federal department in 40 years, to raise the con-
tinuing consideration of these problems for the
first time to the highest council of Government.
the President’s Cabinet.

Through the White House Conference on Edu-
cation, our Republican Administration initiated
the most comprehensive Community-State-Federal
attempt ever made to solve the pressing problems
of primary and secondary education.

Four thousand communities, studying their
school populations and their physical and financial
resources, encouraged our Republican Adminis-
tration to urge a five-year program of Federal
assistance in building schools to relieve a critical
classroom shortage.

The Republican Party will renew its efforts to
enact a program based on sound principles of need
and designed to encourage increased state and
local efforts to build more classrooms.

Our Administration also proposed for the first
time in history, a thorough nation-wide analysis
of rapidly growing problems in education bevond
the high schools.

The Republican Party is determined to press

all such actions that will help insure that every
child has the educational opportunity to advance
to his own greatest capacity.

We have fully resolved to continue our steady
gains in man’s unending struggle against disease
and disability.

We have supported the distribution of free
vaccine to protect millions of children ugainst
dreaded polio.

Republican leadership has enlarged Federal
assistance for construction of hospitals, empha-
sizing low-cost care of chronic diseases and the
special problems of older persons, and increased
Federal aid for medical care of the needy.

“Ve have asked the largest increase in research
fui.ds ever sought in one year to intensify
attacks on cancer, mental illness, heart disease
and other dread diseases.

We demand once again, despite the reluctance
of the Democrat 84th Congress, Federal assistance
to help build facilities to train more physicians
and scientists.

We have encouraged a notable expansion and
improvement of voluntary health insurance, and
urge that reinsurance and pooling arrangements
be authorized to speed this progress.

We have strengthened the Food and Drug .Ad-
ministration, and we have increased the voca-
tional rehabilitation program to enable a l:rger
number of the disabled to return to satisfying
activity.

We have supported measures that have made
more housing available than ever before in
history, reduced urban slums in_local-federal
partnership, stimulated record home ownership,
and authorized additional low-rent public hous-
ing.

We initiated the first flood insurance program
in history under Government sponsorship in co-
operation with private enterprise.

We shall continue to seek extension and per-
fection of a sound social security system.

We pledge close cooperation with State, lecal
and private agencies to reduce the ghastly toll of
fatalities on the Nation’s highways.

Rurat Amenica’s RECOVERY—AGRICULTURE

The men and women operating the farms and
ranches of America have confidence in President
Eisenhower and the Republican farm program.
Our farmers have earned the respect and ap-


preciation of our entire nation for their energy,
rescurcefulness, efficiency, and ability.
Agriculture, our basic industry, must remain
free and prosperous. The Republican Party will
continue to move boldly to help the farmer obtain
his full share of the rewards of good business and
good Government. It is committed to a program
tor agriculture which creates the widest possible

markets and highest attainable income for our
farm and ranch

families. This program must
be versatile and flexible to meet effectively
the impact of rapidly changing conditions.

It does not envision making farmers depend-
ent upen direct governmental payments for
their incomes. Our objective is markets which
retum full parity to our farm and ranch people
when they sell their products. There is no simple,
easy answer to farm problems. Our approach as
ever is a many-sided, versatile and positive pro-
gram to help all farmers and ranchers.

Farm legislation, developed under the Demo-
crat Administration to stimulate production in
wartime, carried a built-in mechanism for the
accumulation of price-depressing surpluses in
peacetime. Under laws sponsored by the Re-
publican Administration, almost $7 billion in
price-depressing surplus farm products have
been moved into use, and the rate of movement
is being accelerated.

Agriculture is successfully making the transition
from wartime to peacetime markets, with less
disruption than at any time after a great war. We
are gratified by the improvement this year in farm
prices and income as a result of our policies.

Our Republican Administration fostered a
constructive Soil Bank Program further to reduce
surpluses and to permit improvement of our soil,
water and timber resources. The Democrat Party
tactics of obstruction and delay have prevented
our farm families from receiving the full benefits
of this program in 1956.

However, by aggressive action, we now have
the Soil Bank in operation, and in 3 months,
half a million farmers have contracted to shift
more than 10 million acres from producing more
surpluses to a soil reserve for the future. For
this they already have earned $225 million. _

This program is a sound aid to removing the
hurdens of surpluses which Democrat programs
placed on farmers. It is now moving into full
operation.

CAMPAIGN OF 1956 §51

Benefits of Social Security have been extended
to farm families. Programs of loans and grants
for farm families hit by flood and drought have
been made operative.

Tax laws were improved to help farmers with
respect to livestock, farm equipment, and conser-
vation practices. We initiated action to refund to
the farmers $60 million annually in taxes on
gasoline used in machinery on the farm.

Cooperation between the U.§. Department of
Agriculture, the State Departments of Agriculture
and land grant colleges and universities is at an
all-time high. This Republican Auministration
has increased support for agricultural research
and education to the highest Jevel in history. New
records of assistance to farm and ranch families
in soil and water conservation were attained in
every year of this Republican Administration.

Convinced that the Government should ever be
the farmer’s helper. never his master, the Re-
publican Party is pledged:

To establish an effective, new research pro-
gram, fully and completely implemented to find
and vigorously promote new uses for farm crops;

To move our agriculture commodities into use
at home and abroad, and to use every appropriate
and effective means to improve marketing, so
that farmers can produce and sell their products
to increase their income and enjoy an improving
level of living;

To encourage the improvement of quality in
farm products through agricultural research, edu-
cation and price support differentials, thus in-
creasing market acceptance both at home and
abroad:

To further help and cooperate with the several
States as co-equals with the federal government
to provide needed research, education, service
and regulatory programs;

To develop farm programs that are fair to all
farmers;

To work toward full freedom instead of
toward more regimentation, developing voluntary
rather than oppressive farm programs;

To encourage agricultural producers in their
efforts to seek solutions to their own production
and price problems;

To provide price supports as in the Agricultural
Act of 1954 that protect farmers, rather than
price their products out of the market;

To continue our commodity loan and market-

ing agreement programs as effective marketing
tools,

To make every effort to develop a more ac-
curate measurement of farm parity;

To safeguard our precious soil and water re-
sources for generations yet unborn;

To encouraze voluntary self-supporting federal
crop insurance;

To bring sympathetic and understanding relief
promptly to farm and ranch families hard hit with
problems of drought, food or other natural
disaster, or economic disaster, and to maintain
the integrity of these programs by terminating
them when the emergency is over;

To assist the young people of American farms
and ranches in their development as future farm-
ers and homemakers;

To continue and expand the Republican-spon-
sored school milk program, to encour» ze further
use of the school lunch program now benefiting
11 million children, and to foster improved nu-
tritional levels;

To provide constructive assistance by effective
purchase and donation to ease temporary market
surpluses, especially for the producers of perish-
able farm products;

To give full support to farmer-owned and
farmer-operated co-operatives;

To encourage and assist adequate private and
cooperative sources of credit, to provide supple-
mental credit through the Farmers Home Ad-
ministration where needed, with an understanding
of both the human and economic problems of
farmers and ranchers;

To expand rural electrification through REA
loans for generation and transmission, and to
expand rural communication facilities,

’ To continue the improvement of rural mail
delivery to farm families;

To promote fully the Republican-sponsored
Rural-Development Program to broaden the opera-
tion and increase the income of low income farm
families and help tenant farmers;

To work with farmers, ranchers and others to
carry forward the Great Plains program to achieve
wise use of lands in the area subject to wind
erosion, so that the people of this region can
enjoy a higher standard of living; and in sum-
mation:

To keep agriculture strong, free, attuned to
peace and not war, to stand ready with a reserve

capacity at all times as a part of our defense,
based on sound agricultural economy.

We are an expanding nation. Our needs for
farm products will continue to grow. Farm prices
are improving and farm income is climbing.

Our farm and ranch people are confident of
the future, despite efforts to frighten them into
accepting economic nostrums and political pana-
ceas. Record numbers of farms are owned by
those who operate them. ,

The Republican Party is pledged to work for
improved farm prices and farm income. We will
seek that improvement boldly, in ways that pro-
tect the family farm. Our objective is a pros-
perous, expanding and free agriculture. We are
dedicated to creating the opportunity for farmers
to earn a high per-family income in a world at
peace.

Feperat GOVERNMENT INTEGRITY

The Republican Party is wholeheartedly com-
mitted to maintaining a Federal Government
that is clean, honorable and increasingly efficient.
It proudly affirms that it has achieved this kind
of Government and dedicated it to the service of
all the people.

Our many economic and social advances of
the past four years are the result of our faithful
adherence to our 1952 pledge to reverse a 20-year
Democratic philosophy calling for more and more
power in Washington.

We have left no stone unturned to remove
from Government the irresponsible and_ those
whose employment was not clearly consistent
with national security.

We believe that working for the Government is
not a right but a privilege. Based on that princi-
ple we will continue a security program to make
certain that all people employed by our Govem-
ment ure of unquestioned loyalty and trustworthi-
ness. The Republican Party will, realistically and
in conformity with constitutional safeguards for
the individual, continue to protect our national
security by enforcing our laws fairly, vigorously,
and with certainty. We will act through the new
division established to this end in the Department
of Justice, and by close coordination among the
intelligence services.

We promise unwavering vigilance against cor-
ruption and waste, and shall continue so to
manage the public business as to warrant our


people's full confidence in the integrity of their
Government.

We condemn illegal lobbying for any cause and
improper use of money in political activities, in-
cluding the use of funds collected by compulsion
for political purposes contrary to the personal
desires of the individual.

Efficiency and Economy in Government. We
pledge to continue our tar reaching program for
improving the efficiency and the effectiveness of
the Federal Government in accordance with the
Principles set forth in the report of the Hoover
Commission.

We are unalterably opposed to unwarranted
growth otf centralized Federal power. We shall
carry forward the worthy effort of the Kestnbaum
Commission on Intergovernmental Affairs to
clarify Federal relationships and strengthen State
and local government.

We shall continue to dispense with Federal
activities wrongfully competing with private
enterprise, and take other sound measures to
reduce the cost of Government.

GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS

Postal Service. In the last four vears, under
direction from President Eisenhower to improve
the postal service and reduce costs, we have
modernized and revitalized the postal establish-
ment from top to bottom, inside and out. We
have undertaken and substantially completed the
largest reorganization ever to take place in any
unit of business or government:

We have provided more than 1200 badly-
needed new post office buildings, and are adding
two more every day. We are using the very latest
types of industrial equipment where practicable;
and, through a program of research and engineer-
ing, we are inventing new mechanical and elec-
tronic devices to speed the movement of mail by
eliminating tedious old-fashioned methods.

We have improved service across the country
in hundreds of wavs. We have extended city
carrier service to millions. of new homes in
thousands of urban and suburban communities
which have grown and spread under the favor-

able economic conditions brought about by the-

Eisenhower Administration.

We have re-inspired the morale of our half-
million employees through new programs of pro-
motion based on ability, job training and safety,

CAMPAIGN OF 1956 553

and through our sponsorship of increased pay and
fringe benefits.

We have adopted the most modern methods of
transportation, accounting and cost control, and
other operating procedures; through them we
have saved many millions of dollars a year for the
taxpayers while advancing the delivery of billions
of letters by a day or more—all this while re-
ducing the enormous deficit c: the Department
from its all time high of almost three-quarters of
a billion dollars in 1952 to less than half that
amount in 1955.

We pledge to continue our efforts, blocked by
the Democratic leadership of the 84th Congress,
for a financially sound, more nearly self-sustain-
ing postal service—with the users of the mails
paying a greater share of the costs instead of the
taxpayers bearing the burden of huge postal
deficits.

We pledge to continue and to complete this
vitally needed program of modernization of build-
ings, equipment, methods and service, so that the
American people will receive the kind of mail
delivery they deserve—the speediest and best
that American ingenuity, technology and modern
business management can provide.

Civil Service. We will vigorously promote, as
we have in the past, a non-political career service
under the merit system which will attract and
retain able servants of the people. Many gains
in this field, notably pay increases and a host of
new benefits, have been achieved in their behalf
in less than four years.

The Republican Party will continue to fight for
eagerly desired new advances for Government
employees, and realistic reappraisement and ad-
justment of benefits for our retired civil service
personnel,

Statehood for Alaska and Hawaii. We pledge
immediate statehood for Alaska, recognizing the
fact that adequate provision for defense require-
ments must be made.

We pledge immediate statehood for Hawaii.

Puerto Rico, We shall continue to encourage
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in its political
growth and economic development in accordance
with the wishes of its people and the fundamental
principle of self-determination.

Indian Affairs. We shall continue to pursue
our enlightened policies which are now producing
exceptional advances in the long struggle to help


554 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

the American Indian gain the material and social
advantages of his birthright and citizenship,
while maintaining to the fullest extent the cul-
tural integrity of the various tribal groups.

We commend the present administration for
its progressive programs which have achieved
such striking progress in preparing our Indian
citizens for participation in normal community
life. Health. educational and employment oppor-
tunities for Indians have been greatly expanded
hovend any previous level, and we favor still
turther extensions of these programs.

We favor most sympathetic and constructive
execution of the Federal trusteeship over Indian
affairs, always in full consultation with Indians
in the management of their interests and the ex-
pansion of their rights of self-government in local
and tribal affairs.

We urge the prompt adjudication or settlement
of pending Indian claims.

District of Columbia. We favor self-govern-
ment, national suffrage and representation in the
Congress of the United States for residents of the
District of Columbia.

Equal Rights. We recommend to Congress the
submission of a constitutional amendment pro-
viding equal rights for men and women.

EovaL OpporTuNiTy AND JUSTICE

Civit RIGHTS

The Republican Party points to an impressive
record of accomplishment in the field of civil
rights and commits itself anew to advancing the
rights of all our people regardless of race, creed,
color or national origin.

In the area of exclusive Federal jurisdiction,
more progress has been made in this field under
the present Republican Administration than in
any similar period in the last 80 years.

The many Negroes who have been appointed
to high public positions have played a significant
part in the progress of this Administration.

Segregation has been ended in the District of
Columbia Government and in the District public
facilities including public schools, restaurants,
theaters and playgrounds. The Eisenhower Ad-
ministration has eliminated discrimination in all
federal employment.

Great progress has been made in eliminating
employment discrimination on the part of those

who do business with the Federal Government
and secure Federal contracts. This Administra.
tion has impartially enforced Federal civil rights
statutes, and we pledge that we will continue to
do so. We support the enactment of the civil
rights program already presented by the Presi.
dent to the Second Session of the S4th Congress,

The regulatory agencies under this Adminis.
tration have moved vigorously to end discrimina-
tion in interstate commerce. Segregation in the
active Arm: * Forces of the United States ts been
ended. For the first time in our history there is
no segregation in veterans’ hospitals and among
civilians on naval bases. This is an imoressive
record. We pledge ourselves to continued prog-
ress in this field.

The Republican Party has unequivocally recog-
nized that the supreme law of the land is em-
bodied in the Constitution, which guarantees to
all people the blessings of liberty, due process
and equal protection of the laws. It confers upon
all native-born and naturalized citizens not only
citizenship in the State where the individual
resides but citizenship of the United States as
well. This is an unqualified right, regardless of
race, creed or color.

The Republican Party accepts the decision of
the U.S. Supreme Court that racial discrimina-
tion in publicly supported schools must be pro-
gressively eliminated. We concur in the con-
clusion of the Supreme Court that its decision
directing school desegregation should be ac-
complished with “all deliberate speed” locally
through Federal District Courts. The implementa-
tion order of the Supreme Court recognizes the
complex and acutely emotional problems created
by its decision in certain sections of our country
where racial patterns have been developed in
accordance with prior and longstanding decisions
of the same tribunal.

We believe that true progress can be attained
through intelligent study, understanding, educa-
tion and good will. Use of force or violence by
any group or agency will tend only to worsen the
many problems inherent in the situation. This
progress must be encouraged and the work of
the courts supported in every legal manner by
all branches of the Federal Government to the
end that the constitutional ideal of equality before
the law, regardless of race, creed or color, will
be steadily achieved.


IMMIGRATION

The Republican Party supports an immigration
policy which is in keeping with the traditions of
America in providing a haven for oppressed
peoples, and which is based on equality of treat-
ment, freedom from implications of discrimina-
tion between racial, natio:ity and religious
groups. and flexible enough to conform to
changing needs and conditions.

We believe that such a policy serves our self-
interest, reflects our responsibility for world
leadership and develops maximum cooperation
with other nations in resolving problems in this
area.

We support the President’s program submitted
to the 84th Congress to carry out needed modifi-
cations in existing law and to take such further
steps as mav be necessary to carry out our tra-
ditional policy.

In that concept, this Republican Administration
sponsored the Refugee Relief Act to provide
asylum for thousands of refugees, expellees and
displaced persons, and undertook in the face of
Democrat opposition to correct the inequities in
existing law and to bring our immigration policies
in line with the dynamic needs of the country
and principles of equity and justice.

We believe also that the Congress should con-
sider the extension of the Refugee Relief Act of
1953 in resolving this dificult refugee problem
which resulted from world conflict. To all this
we give our wholehearted support.

Human FREEDOM AND PEACE

Under the leadership of President Eisenhower,
the United States has advanced foreign policies
which enable our people to enjoy the blessings
of liberty and peace.

The changes in the international scene have
been so great that it is easy to forget the con-
ditions we inherited in 1953.

Peace, so hardly won in 1945, had again been
lost. The Korean War, with its tragic toll of more
than an eighth of a million American casualties,
seemed destined to go on indefinitely. Its material
costs and accompanying inflation were under-
mining our economy. .

Freedom was under assault, and despotism was
on the march. Armed conflict continued in the
Far East, and tensions mounted elsewhere.

The threat of global war increased daily.

CAMPAIGN OF 1956 §55

International Communism which, in 1945,
ruled the 200 million people in the Soviet Union
and Baltic States. was conquering so that, by
1952, it dominate. ore than 700 million people
in 15 once-independent nations.

Today. Now, we are at peace. The Korean
War has been ended. The Communist agg-essors
have been denied their goals.

The threat of global war has receded.

The advance of Communism has been checked,
and, at key points, thrown back. The once-
monolithic structure of International Communism,
denied the stimulant of successive conquests, has
shown hesitancy both internally and abroad.

The Far East, The Korean War was brought
to a close when the Communist rulers were made
to realize that they could not win.

The United States has made a Collective
Defense Treaty with the Republic of Korea which
will exclude, for the future, the Communist mis-
calculation as to announced American interests
and intentions which Jed to the original ag-
gression.

The United States has made a security Treaty
with the Republic of China covering Formosa
and the Pescadores; and the Congress, by virtually
unanimous action, has authorized the President
to employ the armed forces of the United States
to defend this area. As a result, the Chinese
Communists have not attempted to implement
their announced intention to take Formosa by
force.

In Indochina, the Republics of Vietnam and
Cambodia and Laos are now free and independ-
ent nations. The Republic of Vietnam, with the
United States assistance, has denied the Com-
munists the gains which they expected from the
withdrawal of French forces.

The security of Southeast Asia has now been
bolstered by the collective-defense system of
SEATO, and its peoples encouraged by the
declarations in the Pacific Charter of the prin-
ciples of equal rights and self-determination of
peoples.

The Middle East and Southeast Asia. The
Middle East has been strengthened by the de-
fensive unity of the four “northern tier” countries
—Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Pakistan—which hold
gateways to the vast oil resources upon which
depend the industry and military strength of the
free world. This was made possible by the


556 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

liberation of Iran from the grip of the Communist
Tudeh Party. Iran has again made its oil reserves
available to the world under an equitable settle-
ment negotiated by the United States.

We have maintained, and will maintain,
friendly relations with all nations in this vital
area, seeking to mediate differences among them,
and encouraging their legitimate national aspira-
tions.

Europe. In Western Europe, the scene has
been transformed. The Federal Republic of
Germany, which until 1953 was denied sover-
eignty and the opportunity to join the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, has now had full
sovereignty restored by the Treaties of 1954, and
has become a member of NATO despite the
intense opposition of the Soviet Union.

NATO itself has been strengthened by de-
veloping reliance upon new weapons and retalia-
tory power, thus assisting the NATO countries
increasingly to attain both economic welfare and
adequate military defense.

On our initiative, the political aspects of NATO
are being developed. Instead of being merely a
military alliance, NATO will provide a means for
coordinating the policies of the member states on
vital matters, such as the reunification of Ger-
many, the liberation of the satellites, and general
policies in relation to the Soviet Union.

Austria has been liberated. The freedom treaty,
blocked since 1947 by the Soviet Union, was
signed in 1955. For the first time since the end
of World War II, Red Army forces in Europe
evacuated occupied lands.

The emotion-charged dispute between Italy
and Yugoslavia about Trieste was settled with
the active participation of the United States. The
City of Trieste was restored to Italian sovereignty,
and United States and British forces withdrawn.

The Spanish base negotiations, which had long
languished, were successfully concluded, and
close working relations in this important respect
established between the United States and Spain.

The Americas. Our good neighbor policy con-
tinues to prove its wisdom. ;

The American Republics have taken effective
steps against the cancer of Communism. At the
Caracas Conference of March, 1954, they agreed
that if International Communism gained control
of the political institutions of any American re-
public, this would endanger them all, and would

call for collective measures to remove the danger.
This new Doctrine, first proposed by the United
States, extends into modern times the principles
of the Monroe Doctrine.

A first fruit of the Caracas Doctrine was the
expulsion of the Communist regime ruling Guate-
mala. Today, Guatemala is liberated from Krem-
lin control. The Organization of American States
has grown in vigor. It has acted promptly and
effectively to settle hemispheric disputes. In
Costa Rica, for the first time in history, inter-
national aerial inspection was employed to main-
tain peace. The Panama Conference was probably
the most successful in the long history of the
Organization of American States in its promotion
of good will, understanding and friendship.

Relations with Soviet Russia. Far-reaching
steps have been taken to eliminate the danger of
a third world war. President Eisenhower led
the way at Geneva. There he impressed the
Soviet leaders and the world with the dedication
of the United States to peace, but also with its
determination not to purchase peace at the price
of freedom.

That Summit Conference set new forces into
motion. The Soviet rulers professed to renounce
the use of violence, which Stalin had made basic
in the Communist doctrine. Then followed a
repudiation of Stalin, the growth of doctrinal
disputes within the Communist Party, and a dis-
crediting of Party authority and its evil power.
Forces of liberalism within the Soviet Bloc chal-
lenge the brutal and atheistic doctrines of Soviet
Communism. For the first time, we see positive
evidence that forces of freedom and liberation
will inevitably prevail if the free nations maintain
their strength, unity and resolution.

The future. We re-dedicate ourselves to the
pursuit of a just peace and the defense of human
liberty and national independence.

We shall continue vigorously to support the
United Nations.

We shall continue our cooperation with our
sister states of the Americas for the strengthening
of our security, economic and social ties with
them.

We shall continue to support the collective-
security system begun in 1947 and steadily de-
veloped on a bipartisan basis. That system has
joined the United States with 42 other nations
in common defense of freedom. It has created

Su

Ir
w
q
pe
re

a deterrent to war which cannot be nullified by
Soviet veto.

Where needed. we shall help friendly countries
maintain such local forces and economic strength
as provide a first bulwark against Communist
aggression or subversion. We shall reinforce that
defense by a litary capacity which, operating
in accordance with the United Nations Charter,
could so punish aggression that it ceases to be a
profitable pursuit.

We will continue efforts with friends and allies
to assist the underdeveloped areas of the free
world in their efforts to attain greater freedom,
independence and self-determination, and to raise
their standards of living.

We recognize the existence of a major threat
to international peace in the Near East. We sup-
port a policy of impartial friendship for the
peoples of the Arab states and Israel to promote
a peaceful settlement of the causes of tension in
that area, including the human problem of the
Palestine-Arab refugees.

Progress toward a just settlement of the tragic
conflict between the Jewish State and the Arab
nations in Palestine was upset by the Soviet Bloc
sale of arms to Arab countries. But prospects of
peace have now been reinforced by the mission
to Palestine of the United Nations Secretary
General upon the initiative of the United States.

We regard the preservation of Israel as an
im ortant tenet of American foreign policy. We
are determined that the integrity of an inde-
pendent Jewish State shall be maintained. We
shall support the independence of Israel against
armed aggression. The best hope for peace in
the Middle East lies in the United Nations. We
pledge our continued efforts to eliminate the
obstacles to a lasting peace in this area.

We shall continue to seek the reunification of
Germany in freedom, and the liberation of the
satellite states—Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
Rumania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia
and other, once-free countries now behind the
Iron Curtain. The Republican Party stands firmly
with the peoples of these countries in their just
quest for freedom. We are confident that our
peaceful policies, resolutely pursued, will finally
restore freedom and national independence to
oppressed peoples and nations.

We continue to oppose the seating of Com-
munist China in the United Nations, thus up-

CAMPAIGN OF 1956 557

holding international morality. To seat a Com-
munist China which defies, by word and deed,
the principles of the United Nations Charter
would be to betray the letter, violate the spirit
and subvert the purposes of that charter. It
would betray our friend and ally, the Republic
of China. We will continue our detennind
efforts to free the remaining Americans held
prisoner by Communist China.

Recognizing economic health as an indis-
pensable basis of military strength and world
peace, we shall strive to foster abroad and to
practice at home. policies to encourage produc-
tivity and profitable trade.

Barriers which impede internation..' trade and
the How of capital should be reduced on a
gradual, selective and reciprocal basis, with full
recognition of the necessity to safeguard domestic
enterprises, agriculture and labor against unfair
import competition. We proudly point out that
the Republican Party was primarily responsible
for initiating the escape clause and peril point
provisions of law to make effective the necessary
safeguards for American agriculture, labor and
business. We pledge faithful and expeditious
administration of these provisions.

We are against any trade with the Communist
world that would threaten the security of the
United States and our allies.

We recognize that no single nation can alone
defend the liberty of all nations threatened by
Communist aggression or subversion. Mutual
security means effective mutual cooperation.
Poverty and unrest in less developed countries
make them the target for international com-
munism. We must help them achieve the eco-
nomic growth and stability necessary to attain
and preserve their independence.

Technical and economic assistance programs
are effective countermeasures to Soviet economic
offensives and propaganda. They provide the
best way to create the political and social stability
essential to lasting peace.

We will strive to bring about conditions that
will end the injustices of nations divided against
their will, of nattons held subject to foreign
domination, of peoples deprived of the right of
self-government.

We reaffirm the principle of freedom for all
peoples, and look forward to the eventual end
of colonialism.


558 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

We will overlook no opportunity that, with
prudence. can be taken to bring about a pro-
gressive elimination of the barriers that interfere
with the free flow of news, information and ideas,
and the exchange of persons between the free
peoples and the captive peoples of the world.
We favor the continuance and development of
the “exchange-of-persons” programs between free
nations.

We approve appropriate action to oppose the
imposition by foreign governments of discrimina-
tion against United States citizens, based on their
religion or race.

We shall continue the bipartisan development
of foreign policies. We hold this necessary if
those policies are to have continuity, and be re-
garded by other free nations as dependable.

The Republican Party pledges itself to continue
the dynamic, courageous, sound and _ patriotic
policies which have protected and promoted the
interests of the United States during the past
four years.

In a world fraught with peril, peace can be
won and preserved only by vigilance and inspired
leadership. In such a world, we believe it is
essential that the vast experience of our proven
leader, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, con-
tinues to guide our country in the achievement
and maintenance of a just, honorable and durable
peace.

BULWARK FOR THE FREE Woritp-—-Our NATIONAL
DEFENSE

The military strength of the United States
has been a key factor in the preservation of
world peace during the past four years. We are
determined to maintain that strength so long as
our security and the peace of the world require
it.

This Administration, within six months after
President Eisenhower's inauguration, ended the
war in Korea by concluding an honorable armi-
stice. The lesson of that war and our lack of
preparedness which brought it about will not be
forgotten. Such mistakes must not be repeated.

As we maintain and strengthen the security of
this Nation, we shall, consistent with this Ad-
ministration’s dedication to peace, strive for the
acceptance of realistic proposals for disarmament
and the humanitarian control of weapons of mass
destruction.

Our country’s defense posture is today a visible
and powerful deterrent against attack by any
enemy, from any quarter, at any time.

We have the strongest striking force in the
world—in the air—on the sea—and a magnificent
supporting land force in our Army and Marine
Corps. Such visible and powerful deterrents
must continue to include:

A) A jet-powered, long-range strategic air
force, and a tactical air force of the fastest and
very latest type aircraft, with a striking capability
superior to any other;

B) The most effective guided and _ ballistic
missiles;

C) A modem navy, with a powerful naval
aircraft arm prepared to keep the sea lanes open
to meet any assignment;

D) An army whose mobility and unit fire-
power are without equal;

E) Bases, strategically dispersed at home and
around the world, essential to all these operations.

We will maintain and improve the effective
strength and state of readiness of all these armed
forces.

To achieve this objective, we must depend
upon attracting to, and retaining in our military
services vigorous and well-trained manpower,
and upon continuously maintaining in reserve, an
enthusiastic and well-informed group of men and
women. This will require incentives that will
make armed service careers attractive and re-
warding. A substantial start has been made
toward bolstering the rewards and benefits that
accompany a military career. We must continue
to provide them.

In order that American youth in our armed
services shall be provided with the most modern
weapons, we have supported and will continue
to support an effective and well-directed program
of research and development, staffed by men of
the highest caliber and ability in this field. There
is no substitute for the best where the lives of our
men and the defense of our Nation are concerned.

We fully appreciate ‘he importance of scientific
knowledge and its appiication particularly in the
military field.

We pledge ourselves to stimulate and en-
courage the education of our young people in the
sciences with a determination to maintain our
technological leadership.

In this age of weapons of inconceivable destruc-


tiveness, we must not neglect the protection of
the civilian population by all known means, while,
at the same time, preparing our armed forces for
every eventuality.

We wholeheartedly agree with President Eisen-
hower that our military defense must be backed
by a strong civil defense, and that an effective
civil defense is an important deterrent against
attack upon our country, and an indispensable
reliance should our nation ever be attacked.

We support his proposals for strengthening
civil defense, mindful that it has become an
effective Government arm to deal with natural
disasters.

We shall continue to carry forward, vigorously
and effectively, the valued services of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, as well as all other
Government intelligence agencies, so as to insure
that we are protected at all times against sub-
versive activities. We will never relax our de-
termined efforts to keep our Government, and our
people, safely guarded against all enemies from
within,

We agree and assert that civilian authority and
control over our defense structure and program
must be ma-ntained at all times. We believe,
without qualification, that in our present Com-
mander-in-Chief, Dwight D. Eisenhower, this
Nation possesses a leader equipped by training,
temperament, and experience in war and in peace,
for both that personal example and that direction
of our national defense in which the American
people will continue to have confidence, and in
which the peoples of all the free world will find
an increasing sense of security and of an oppor-
tunity for peace.

VETERANS

We believe that active duty in the Armed
Forces during a state of war or national emergency
is the highest call of citizenship constituting a
special service to our nation and entitles those
who have served to positive assistance to alleviate
the injuries, hardships and handicaps imposed by
their service. .

In recognizing this principle under previous
Republican Administrations we established the
Veterans Administration. This Republican Ad-
ministration increased compensation and pension
benefits for veterans and survivors to provide
more adequate levels and to off-set cost of living

CAMPAIGN OF 1956 559

increases that occurred during the most recent
Democratic Administration.

We have also improved quality of hospital
service and have established a long-range program
for continued improvement of such service. We
have strengthened and extended survivors’ bene-
fits, thus affording greater security for all veterans
in the interest of equity and justice.

In advancing this Republican program we
pledge:

That compensation for injuries and disease
arising out of service be fairly and generously
provided for all disabled veterans and for their
dependents or survivors;

That a pension program for disabled war
veterans in need and for their widows and orphans
in need be maintained as long as necessary to
assure them adequate income;

That all veterans be given equal and adequate
opportunity for readjustment following service,
including unemployment compensation when
needed, but placing emphasis on obtaining suit-
able employment for veterans, particularly those
disabled, by using appropriate facilities of gov-
ernment and by assuring that Federal employment
preference and re-employment rights, to which the
veteran is entitled, are received;

That the Veterans Administration be continued
as a single independent agency providing veter-
ans services;

That the service-disabled continue to receive
first-priority medical services of the highest stand-
ard and that non-service disabled war veterans in
need receive hospital care to the extent that beds
are available.

GuarpING AND ImprROvING Our ReEsounces

One of the brightest areas of achievement and
progress under the Eisenhower Administration
has been in resource conservation and develop-
ment and in sound, long-range public works
programing.

Policies of sound conservation and wise de-
velopment—originally advanced half a century
ago under that pre-eminent Republican conserva-
tion team of President Theodore Roosevelt and
Gifford Pinchot and amplified by succeeding Re-
publican Administrations—have been pursued by
the Eisenhower Administration, While meeting
the essential development needs of the people,
this Administration has conserved and safeguarded


560 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

our natural resources for the greatest good of all,
now and in the future.

Our national parks, national forests and wild-
life refuges are now more adequately financed,
better protected and more extensive than ever
before. Long-range improvement programs, such
as Mission 66 for the National Parks system, are
now under way. and studies are nearing com-
pletion for a comparable program for the National
Forests. These forward-looking programs will be
aggressively continued.

Our Republican Administration has modernized
and vitalized our mining laws by the first major
revision in more than 30 years.

Recreation, parks and wildlife. ACHIEVE-
MENTS: Reversed the 15-year trend of neglect
of our National Parks by launching the 10-year,
$785 million Mission 66 parks improvement pro-
gram. Has nearly completed field surveys for a
comparable forest improvement program. Ob-
tained passage of the so-called “Week-end Miner
Bill.” Added more than 400,000 acres to our
National Park system, and 90,000 acres to wildlife
refuges. Has undertaken well-conceived measures
to protect reserved areas of all types and to pro-
vide increased staffs and operating funds for
public recreation agencies.

We favor full recognition of recreation as an
important public use of our national forests and
public domain lands.

We favor a comprehensive study of the effect
upon wildlife of the drainage of our wetlands.

We favor recognition, by the States, of wild-
life and recreation management and conservation
as a beneficial use of water.

We subscribe to the general objectives of
groups seeking to guard the beauty of our land
and to promote clean, attractive surroundings
throughout America.

We recognize the need for maintaining isolated
wilderness areas to provide opportunity for future
generations to experience some of the wilderness
living through which the traditional American
spirit of hardihood was developed.

Public land and forest resources. ACHIEVE-
MENTS: Approved conservation programs of
many types, including improvement of western
grazing lands through reseeding programs, water-
spreading systems, and encouragement of soil-
and moisture-conservation practices by range
users. Returned to the States their submerged

lands and resources of their coasts, out to their
historical boundaries—an area comprising about
one tenth of the area off the Continental Shelf
and about 17 per cent of the mineral resources.
Initiated leasing of the Federally owned 83 per
cent of the Continental Shelf which is expected
ultimately to bring from 6 to 8 billion dollars into
the Treasury and already has brought in over 230
million dollars. Enacted new legislation to en-
courage multiple use of the public domain.

We commend the Eisenhower Administration
for its administration of our public lands and for
elimination of bureaucratic abuses. We recom-
mend continuing study and evaluation of the
advisability of returning unused or inadequately
used public lands.

We commend the Administration for expanding
forest research and access road construction.

We shall continue to improve timber conserva-
tion practices, recreational facilities, grazing man-
agement, and watershed protection of our national
forests and our public domain.

Minerals. Recognizing that a vigorous and
efficient mineral industry is essential to the long-
term development of the United States, and to its
defense, we believe the Federal Government
should foster a long-term policy for the develop-
ment and prudent use of domestic mineral re-
sources, and to assure access to necessary sources
abroad, without dangerously weakening the mar-
ket for domestic production of defense-essential
materials.

We favor reasonable depletion allowances. We
favor freedom of mineral producers from un-
necessary governmental regulation; expansion of
government minerals exploration and research,
and establishment of minerals stockpile objectives
which will reduce, and, where possible, eliminate
foreseeable wartime shortages.

ACHIEVEMENTS: St. Lawrence Seaway
and power projects, Colorado River Storage
Project, Great Lakes connecting channels, small
watershed protection and flood prevention under
local control, Mississippi Gulf level canal, ex-
tension of water-pollution control program, sur-
vey of power potential of Passamaquoddy Bay
tides, expansion of small project development for
flood control, navigation and reclamation; ex-
tension to all 48 States of water facilities act,
accelerated research on saline water conversion,
authorized planning surveys and construction of

more than 200 navigation, flood-control, beach
erosion, rivers and harbors, reclamation, and
watershed projects throughout the nation, ad-
vanced partnership water resource developments
in a number of states.

Water resources. Water resource development
legislation enacted under the Eisenhower Ad-
ministration already has ushered in one of the
greatest water resource development programs
this Nation has ever seen, a soundly-conceived
construction program that will continue through-
out this Century and beyond.

We recognize that the burgeoning growth of
our Nation requires a combination of Federal,
State and local water and power development—
a real partnership of effort by all interested
parties. In no other way can the nation meet
the huge and accelerated demands for increasing
generating capacity and uses of water, both by
urban and agricultural areas. We also are aware
that water demands have been accentuated
by the ravages of drought, creating emergency
conditions in many sections of our country.
We commend the Eisenhower Administration
for encouraging state and local governments,
public agencies, and regulated private enterprise,
to participate actively in comprehensive water
and power development. In such partnership
we are leading the way with great Federal de-
velopments such as the Upper Colorado Project
and with partnership projects of great importance,
some of which have been shelved by the Demo-
cratic 84th Congress.

In the marketing of federally produced power
we support preference to public bodies and co-
operatives under the historic policy of the Con-
gress.

We will continue to press for co-operative
solution of all problems of water supply and
distribution, reclamation, pollution, flood control,
and saline-water conversion.

We pledge legislative support to the arid and
semi-arid states in preserving the integrity of their
water laws and customs as developed out of the

necessities of these regions. We affirm the his- .

toric policy of Congress recognizing State water
rights, as repeatedly expressed in Federal law over
the past 90 years.

We pledge an expansion in research and
planning of water resource development pro-
grams, looking to the future when it may be

CAMPAIGN OF 1956 561

necessary to re-distribute water from water-surplus
areas to water-deficient areas.

Fisheries. ACHIEVEMENTS: Accelerated re-
search and administrative action to rehabilitate
our long-neglected fishing industry. Approval of
measures for additional con: -vation and propaga-
tion of fish. Development ur the comprehensive
program for fisheries management and assistance
adopted by the Congress.

We favor continuation of the Eisenhower pro-
gram to rehabilitate our long-neglected domestic
fishing industry.

We advocate protective treaties insuring the
United States commercial-fisheries industry
against unfair foreign competition.

The Republican Party is acutely aware that a
foundation stone of the nation’s strength is its
wealth of natural resources and the high develop-
ment of its physical assets. They are the basis
of our great progress in 180 years of freedom and
of our nation’s military and economic might.

We pledge that we will continue the policies
of sound conservation and wise development
instituted by this Administration to insure that
our resources are managed as a beneficial trust
for all the people.

For «a BRIGHTER TOMORROW

Atomic Energy. The Republican Party pledges
continuous, vigorous development of Atomic
Energy:

for the defense of our own country and to
deter aggression, and

for the promotion of world peace and the en-
hancement of our knowledge of basic science and
its application to industry, agriculture and the
healing arts.

From the passage of the first Atomic Energy
Act in 1946 to the beginning of this Republican
Administration, a stalemate had existed, and only
an arms race with the prospect of eventual ca-
tastrophe faced the nations of the world.

President Eisenhower has inaugurated and led
a strong program for developing the peaceful
atom—a program which has captured the imagi-
nation of men and women everywhere with its
widespread, positive achievements.

The Government and private enterprise are
working together on a number of large-scale
projects designed to develop substantial quanti-
ties of electric power from atomic sources. The


562 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

first power reactor will be completed next year.
More and more private funds are being invested
as the Government monopoly is relaxed.

In relaxing its monopoly, Government can
stimulate private enterprise to go ahead by taking

recognition of the tremendous risks involved and —

the complexity of the many technical problems
that will arise, and assist in those ways that will
make advances possible.

The Atomic Energy Commission also is en-
couraging a vigorous rural electrification program
by cooperatives.

Every day, radioactive isotopes are brought
more and more into use on farms, in clinics and
hospitals, and in industry. The use of isotopes
already has resulted in annual savings of hundreds
of millions of dollars and the nuclear age has only
begun.

It is to the benefit of the United States, as
well as to all nations everywhere, that the uses
of atomic energy be explored and shared. The
Republican Party pledges that it will continue
this imaginative, world-embracing program. We
shall continue to chart our course so as to fortify
the security of the free nations and to further
the prosperity and progress of all people every-
where.

DECLARATION OF DEDICATION

With utmost confidence in the future and with
justifiable pride in our achievements, the Re-
publican Party warmly greets the dawn of our
second century of service in the cause of unity
and progress in the Nation.

As the Party of the Young and in glowing
appreciation of his dynamic leadership and inspi-
ration, we respectfully dedicate this Platform of
the Party of the Future to our distinguished
President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and to the
Youth of America.

Socialist Party Platform: 1956

The Socialist Party is pledged to building a
new, more democratic society in the United
States; a society in which human rights come
before property rights; a nation which can take
its place in a World Federation of Cooperative
Commonwealths which will eliminate war, racial
antagonism, hunger, disease, poverty and oppres-
sion.

The Socialist Party is pledged to building and

to maintaining this new society by democratic
means, for without freedom there can be no
true socialism and without socialism there can
be no enduring freedom.

Socialism is the social ownership and demo-
cratic control of the means of production. Social
ownership, which includes cooperatives, is not
usually government ownership. Democratic con-
trol is not administration by the central govern.
ment but control by the people most directly
affected and in the interest of all the people
rather than for profit. The American people have
already adopted many socialist measures to serve
their needs when capitalism, with its profit mo-
tive, failed them.

In a big business economy, the claim that “free
enterprise” and liberty go hand-in-hand is arrant
nonsense. The power of monopoly is a threat to
the democratic process. The right of the few to
rob the many is a flagrant denial of freedom.
Not until the robbery is ended can we have
liberty, equality and fraternity.

The Socialist Party is committed to a policy
of forthright, deliberate, planned introduction of
socialism. Creeping into socialism when capitalism
fails does not promote the welfare of the people
or preserve democracy and freedom.

The Socialist Party of the United States is
dedicated to building socialism in this strong-
hold of capitalism because, even at its greatest.
capitalism fails to satisfy the finest aspirations of
its people. For war, it achieved great heights of
productivity; for peace, it is incapable of equal
performance. The development of the highest
living standard in the world cannot excuse the
inequality in division of wealth, which means
that one family in ten receives an annual income
of less than $1,000 and more than two families in
ten have less than $2,000 per vear. In fact, the
lower half of our population receives a smaller
share of the total money income of the United
States now than it did early in this century.

Our program is international as well as do-
mestic. The American people do not share fairly
in the wealth they themselves create; still less
have the people of the underdeveloped areas
been helped to pull themselves up to the level of
decency which alone can provide the stability for
enduring peace. The basic purpose of socialist
foreign policy is to prevent another world war.
The first step is to abolish every form of colonial-",78999,12396,"eee ‘an administration pledged to the above pro- gram is essential for effective steps toward solv- ing this important problem. conclusion what is needed is a re-alignment of voters and the union ef zood citizens in a party which will support oniv candidates of unquestioned in- tewrity and competence, who will faithfully serve the commonwealth and set a good example of pubhe and private morality, and who are com- mitted to the principles of this platform. we urge all who believe in these principles to vote their convictions and help us achieve a clean, honest and humane government “of the people. by the people, and for the people,” under god. republican platform declaration of faith america’s trust is in the merciful providence of god. in whose image every man is created . . . the source of every man’s dignity and freedom. in this trust our republic was founded. we give devoted homage to the founding fathers. they not only proclaimed that the freedom and rights of men came from the creator and not from the state. but they provided safeguards to those freedoms. our government was created by the people for all the people, and it must serve no less a purpose. the republican party was formed years ago to preserve the nation’s devotion to these ideals. on its centennial, the republican party again calls to the minds of all americans the great truth first spoken by abraham lincoln: “the legitimate object of covernment is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done but cannot do at all, or cannot so well do, for themselves in their separate and individual capacities. but in all that people can individually do as well for themselves, government ought not to interfere.” ’ our great president dwight d. eisenhower has counseled us further: “in all those things which deal with people, be liberal, be human. in all those things which deal with people’s money, campaign of ev their economy, or their form of government, be conservative.” while jealously guarding the free institutions nd preserving the principles upon which our republic was founded and has flourished. the purpose of the republican party is to establish and maintain a peaceful world and build at home a dynamic prosperity in which every citizen fairly shares. . we shall ever build anew, that our children and their children, without distinction because of race, creed or color, may know the blessings of our free land. we believe that busic to governmental integrity are unimpeachable ethical standards and_ irre- proachable personal conduct by all people in government. we shall continue our insistence on honesty as an indispensable requirement. of public service. we shall continue to root out corruption whenever and wherever it appears. we are proud of and shall continue our far- reaching and sound advances in matters of basic human needs — expansion of social security — broadened coverage in unemployment insurance —improved housing—and better health protection for all our people. we are determined that our government remain warmly responsive to the urgent social and economic problems of our people. to these beliefs we commit ourselves as we present this record and declare our goals for the future. nearly four years ago when the peorle of this nation entrusted their government to presi- dent eisenhower and the republican party, we were locked in a costly and stalemated war. now we have an honorable peace, which has stopped the bitter toll in casualties and resources, ended depressing wartime restraints, curbed the run- away inflation and unleashed the boundless energy of our people to forge forward on the road to progress. in four years we have achieved the highest economic level with the most widely shared benefits that the world has ever seen. we of the republican party have fostered this prosperity and are dedicated to its expansion and to the preservation of the climate in which it has thrived. we are proud of our part in bringing into a position of unique authority in the world one who symbolizes, as can no other man, the hopes of all national party platforms peoples for peace, liberty and justice. one leader in the world today towers above all others and inspires the trust, admiration, confidence and good will of all the peoples of every nation— dwight d. eisenhower. under his leadership, the republican administration has carried out foreign policies which have enabled our people to enjoy in peace the blessings of liberty. we shall continue to work unceasingly for a just and enduring peace in a world freed of tyranny. every honorable means at our command has been exercised to alleviate the grievances and causes of armed conflict among nations. the advance of communism and its enslavement of people has been checked, and, at key points, thrown back. austria, iran and guatemala have been liberated from kremlin control. forces of freedom are at work ir. -he nations still enslaved by communist imperialism. we firmly believe in the right of peoples everywhere to determine their form of govern- ment, their leaders, their destiny, in peace. where needed, in order to promote peace and freedom throughout the world, we shall within the prudent limits of our resources, assist friendly countries in their determined efforts to strengthen their econo- mies. we hold high hopes for useful service to man- kind in the power of the atom. we shall gener- ously assist the international atomic energy agency, now evolving from president eisenhower's “atoms for peace” proposal, in an effort to find ways to dedicate man’s genius not to his death, but to his life. we maintain that no treaty or international agreement can deprive any of our citizens of constitutional rights. we shall see to it that no treaty or agreement with other countries attempts to deprive our citizens of the rights guaranteed them by the federal constitution. president eisenhower has given the world bold proposals for mutual arms reduction and protection against aggression through flying sentinels in an “open sky.” we support this and his further offer of united states participation in an international: fund for economic development financed from the savings brought by true disarmament. we approve his determined. resistance to disarmament without effective inspection. we work and pray for the day when the domination of any people from any source will have ended, and when there will be liberation and true freedom for the hundreds of millions of individuals now held in subjugation. we shall continue to dedicate our best efforts to this lofty purpose. we shall continue vigorously to support the united nations. we shall continue to oppose the seating of communist china in the united nations. we shall maintain our powerful military strength as a deterrent to aggression and as a guardian of the peace. we shall maintain it ready, balanced and technologically advanced for these objectives only. good times in america have reached breadth and depth never before known by any nation. moreover, it is a prosperity of a nation at peace, not at war. we shall continue to encourage the good business and sound employee relationships which have made possible for the first time in our history a productive capacity of more than $ billion a year. nearly million people have full-time jobs, with real wages and personal in- come at record highs. the farmers of america are at last able to look to the future with a confidence based on ex- panding peacetime markets instead of on politi- cally contrived formulas foredoomed to fail except in a wartime economy. the objective is to insure that agriculture shares fairly and fully in our record prosperity without needless federal med- dlings and domination. restoration of integrity in government has been an essential element to the achievement of our unparalleled good times. we will faithfully preserve the sound financial management which already has reduced annual spending $ billion below the budgets planned by our democratic predecessors and made possible in a $.- billion tax cut, the largest one-year tax reduction in history. we will ever fight the demoralizing influence of inflation as a national way of life. we are proud to have fulfilled our pledge to halt the skyrocketing cost of living that in the previous years had cut the value of the dollar by half, and robbed millions of the full value of their wages, savings, insurance, pensions and _ social security. we have balanced the budget. we believe a res and will continue to prove that thrift, prudence and a sensible respect for living within income applies as surely to the management of our gov- ernment’s budget as it does to the family budget. we hold that the major world issue today is whether government shall be the servant or the master of men. we hold that the bill of rights is the sacred foundation of personal liberty. that men are created equal needs no affirmation, but they must have equality of opportunity and protection of their civil rights under the law. we hold that the strict division of powers and the primary responsibility of state and local governments must be maintained, and that the centralization of powers in the national govern- ment leads to expansion of the mastery of our lives. we hold that the protection of the freedom of men requires that budgets be balanced, waste in government eliminated, and taxes reduced. in these and all other areas of proper govern- ment concern, we pledge our best thought and whole energy to a continuation of our prized peace, prosperity and progress. for our guidance in fulfilling this responsibility, president eisenhower has given us a statement of principles that is neither partisan nor prejudiced, but warmly american: the individual is of supreme importance. the spirit of our people is the strength of our nation. america does not prosper unless all ameri- cans prosper. government must have a heart as well as a head. courage in principle, cooperation in practice make freedom positive. to stay free, we must stay strong. under god, we espouse the cause of free- dom and justice and peace for all peoples. embracing these guides to positive, construc- tive action, and in their rich spirit, we ask the support of the american people for the election of a republican congress and the re-election of the nation’s devoted and dedicated leader — dwight d. eisenhower. declaration of determination in the interest of complete public understand- ing, elaboration of republican aspirations and campaign of achievements is desirable in the areas of broadest public concern. dynamic economy—free labor taxation and fiscat powicy the republican party takes pride in calling at- tention to the outstanding fiscal achievements of the eisenhower administration, several of which are mentioned in the foreword to these resolu- tions. in order to progress further in correcting the unfortunate results of unwise financial manage- ment during years of democrat administra- tions, we pledge to pursue the following ob- jectives: further reductions in government spending as recommended in the hoover commission re- port, without weakening the support of a superior defense program or depreciating the quality of essential services of government to our peuple. continued balancing of the budget, to assure the financial strength of the country which is so vital to the struggle of the free world in its battle against communism; and to maintain the pur- chasing power of a sound dollar, and the value of savings, pensions and insurance. gradual reduction of the national debt. then, insofar as consistent with a balanced budget, we pledge to work toward these addi- tional objectives: further reductions in taxes with particular consideration for low and middle income [amikes. initiation of a sound policy of tax reductions which will encourage small independent busi- nesses to modernize and progress. continual study of additional ways to correct inequities in the effect of various taxes. consistent with the republican administra- tion’s accomplishment in stemming the inflation —which under five democrat administrations had cut the value of the dollar in half, and so had robbed the wage earner and millions of thrifty citizens who had savings. pensions and insurance—we endorse the present policy of _freedom for the federal reserve system to com- bat both inflation and deflation by wise fiscal policy. the republican party believes that sound money, which retains its buying power, is an essential foundation for new jobs, a higher stand- y | national party platforms i wid oof

republican administration, as our country has prospered, so have its people. this is as it should be, for as president eisenhower said: “labor is the united states. the men and women, who with their minds, their hearts and hands, create the wealth that is shared in this country—they are america.” the eisenhower administration has brought to our people the highest employment, the high- est wages and the highest standard of living ever enjoyed by any nation. today there are nearly million men and women at work in the united states, million more than in . wages have increased substantially over the past years; but. more important, the american wage earner today can buy more than ever before for himself and his family because .his pay check has not been eaten away by rising taxes and soaring prices. the record of performance of the republican administration on behalf of our working men and women goes still further. the federal minimum wage has been raised for more than million workers. social security has been extended to an additional million workers and the benefits raised for % million. the protection of unem- ployment insurance has been brought to million additional workers. there have been increased workmen’s compensation benefits for longshore- men and harbor workers, increased retirement benefits for railroad employees, and wage in- creases and improved welfare and pension plans for federal emplovees. in addition, the eisenhower administration has enforced more vigorously and effectively than. ever before. the laws which protect the working standards of our people. workers have benefited by the progress which has been made in carrying out the programs and principles set forth in the republican plat- campaign of form. all workers have gained and unions have grown in strength and responsibility, and have increased their membership by millions. furthermore, the process of free collective bargaining has been strengthened by the insist- ence of this administration that labor and man- agement settle their differences at the bargaining table without the intervention of the government. this policy has brought to our country an un- precedented period of labor-management peace and understanding. we applaud the effective, unhindered, collective bargaining which brought an early end to the steel strike, in contrast to the six months’ upheaval, presidential seizure of the steel indus- try and ultimate supreme court intervention under the last democrat administration. the eisenhower administration will continue to fight for dynamic and progressive programs which, among other things, will: stimulate improved job safety of our workers, through assistance to the states, employees and employers; continue and further perfect its programs of assistance to the millions of workers with special employment problems, such as older workers, handicapped workers, members of minority groups, and migratory workers; strengthen and improve the federal-state em- ployment service and improve the effectiveness of the unemployment insurance system; protect by law, the assets of employee welfare and benefit plans so that workers who are the beneficiaries can be assured of their rightful benefits; assure equal pay for equal work regardless of sex; clarify and strengthen the eight-hour laws for the benefit of workers who are subject to federal wage standards on federal and federally- assisted construction, and maintain and continue the vigorous administration of the federal pre- vailing minimum wage law for public supply contracts; extend the protection of the federal minimum wage laws to as many more workers as is possible and practicable; continue to fight for the elimination of dis- crimination in employment because of race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry or sex; provide assistance to improve the economic national party platforms conditions of areas faced with persistent and sub- stantial unemployment: revise and improve the taft-hartley act so as to protect more effectively the rights of labor unions, management, the individual worker, and the public. the protection of the right of workers to organize into unions and to bargain collectively is the firm and permanent policy of the eisen- hower administration. in , and again in , president eisenhower recommended constructive amendments to this act. the demo- crats in congress have consistently blocked these needed changes by parliamentary maneuvers. the republican party pledges itself to overhaul and improve the taft-hartley act along the lines of these recommendations. human welfare and advancement health, epucation anp welfare the republican party believes that the physi- cal, mental. and spiritual well-being of the people is as important as their economic health. it will continue to support this conviction with vigorous action. republican action created the department of health, education and welfare as the first new federal department in years, to raise the con- tinuing consideration of these problems for the first time to the highest council of government. the president’s cabinet. through the white house conference on edu- cation, our republican administration initiated the most comprehensive community-state-federal attempt ever made to solve the pressing problems of primary and secondary education. four thousand communities, studying their school populations and their physical and financial resources, encouraged our republican adminis- tration to urge a five-year program of federal assistance in building schools to relieve a critical classroom shortage. the republican party will renew its efforts to enact a program based on sound principles of need and designed to encourage increased state and local efforts to build more classrooms. our administration also proposed for the first time in history, a thorough nation-wide analysis of rapidly growing problems in education bevond the high schools. the republican party is determined to press all such actions that will help insure that every child has the educational opportunity to advance to his own greatest capacity. we have fully resolved to continue our steady gains in man’s unending struggle against disease and disability. we have supported the distribution of free vaccine to protect millions of children ugainst dreaded polio. republican leadership has enlarged federal assistance for construction of hospitals, empha- sizing low-cost care of chronic diseases and the special problems of older persons, and increased federal aid for medical care of the needy. “ve have asked the largest increase in research fui.ds ever sought in one year to intensify attacks on cancer, mental illness, heart disease and other dread diseases. we demand once again, despite the reluctance of the democrat 84th congress, federal assistance to help build facilities to train more physicians and scientists. we have encouraged a notable expansion and improvement of voluntary health insurance, and urge that reinsurance and pooling arrangements be authorized to speed this progress. we have strengthened the food and drug .ad- ministration, and we have increased the voca- tional rehabilitation program to enable a l:rger number of the disabled to return to satisfying activity. we have supported measures that have made more housing available than ever before in history, reduced urban slums in_local-federal partnership, stimulated record home ownership, and authorized additional low-rent public hous- ing. we initiated the first flood insurance program in history under government sponsorship in co- operation with private enterprise. we shall continue to seek extension and per- fection of a sound social security system. we pledge close cooperation with state, lecal and private agencies to reduce the ghastly toll of fatalities on the nation’s highways. rurat amenica’s recovery—agriculture the men and women operating the farms and ranches of america have confidence in president eisenhower and the republican farm program. our farmers have earned the respect and ap- preciation of our entire nation for their energy, rescurcefulness, efficiency, and ability. agriculture, our basic industry, must remain free and prosperous. the republican party will continue to move boldly to help the farmer obtain his full share of the rewards of good business and good government. it is committed to a program tor agriculture which creates the widest possible markets and highest attainable income for our farm and ranch families. this program must be versatile and flexible to meet effectively the impact of rapidly changing conditions. it does not envision making farmers depend- ent upen direct governmental payments for their incomes. our objective is markets which retum full parity to our farm and ranch people when they sell their products. there is no simple, easy answer to farm problems. our approach as ever is a many-sided, versatile and positive pro- gram to help all farmers and ranchers. farm legislation, developed under the demo- crat administration to stimulate production in wartime, carried a built-in mechanism for the accumulation of price-depressing surpluses in peacetime. under laws sponsored by the re- publican administration, almost $ billion in price-depressing surplus farm products have been moved into use, and the rate of movement is being accelerated. agriculture is successfully making the transition from wartime to peacetime markets, with less disruption than at any time after a great war. we are gratified by the improvement this year in farm prices and income as a result of our policies. our republican administration fostered a constructive soil bank program further to reduce surpluses and to permit improvement of our soil, water and timber resources. the democrat party tactics of obstruction and delay have prevented our farm families from receiving the full benefits of this program in . however, by aggressive action, we now have the soil bank in operation, and in months, half a million farmers have contracted to shift more than million acres from producing more surpluses to a soil reserve for the future. for this they already have earned $ million. _ this program is a sound aid to removing the hurdens of surpluses which democrat programs placed on farmers. it is now moving into full operation. campaign of § benefits of social security have been extended to farm families. programs of loans and grants for farm families hit by flood and drought have been made operative. tax laws were improved to help farmers with respect to livestock, farm equipment, and conser- vation practices. we initiated action to refund to the farmers $ million annually in taxes on gasoline used in machinery on the farm. cooperation between the u.§. department of agriculture, the state departments of agriculture and land grant colleges and universities is at an all-time high. this republican auministration has increased support for agricultural research and education to the highest jevel in history. new records of assistance to farm and ranch families in soil and water conservation were attained in every year of this republican administration. convinced that the government should ever be the farmer’s helper. never his master, the re- publican party is pledged: to establish an effective, new research pro- gram, fully and completely implemented to find and vigorously promote new uses for farm crops; to move our agriculture commodities into use at home and abroad, and to use every appropriate and effective means to improve marketing, so that farmers can produce and sell their products to increase their income and enjoy an improving level of living; to encourage the improvement of quality in farm products through agricultural research, edu- cation and price support differentials, thus in- creasing market acceptance both at home and abroad: to further help and cooperate with the several states as co-equals with the federal government to provide needed research, education, service and regulatory programs; to develop farm programs that are fair to all farmers; to work toward full freedom instead of toward more regimentation, developing voluntary rather than oppressive farm programs; to encourage agricultural producers in their efforts to seek solutions to their own production and price problems; to provide price supports as in the agricultural act of that protect farmers, rather than price their products out of the market; to continue our commodity loan and market- ee a alee pe amg ree torts nie : national party platforms ing agreement programs as effective marketing tools, to make every effort to develop a more ac- curate measurement of farm parity; to safeguard our precious soil and water re- sources for generations yet unborn; to encouraze voluntary self-supporting federal crop insurance; to bring sympathetic and understanding relief promptly to farm and ranch families hard hit with problems of drought, food or other natural disaster, or economic disaster, and to maintain the integrity of these programs by terminating them when the emergency is over; to assist the young people of american farms and ranches in their development as future farm- ers and homemakers; to continue and expand the republican-spon- sored school milk program, to encour» ze further use of the school lunch program now benefiting million children, and to foster improved nu- tritional levels; to provide constructive assistance by effective purchase and donation to ease temporary market surpluses, especially for the producers of perish- able farm products; to give full support to farmer-owned and farmer-operated co-operatives; to encourage and assist adequate private and cooperative sources of credit, to provide supple- mental credit through the farmers home ad- ministration where needed, with an understanding of both the human and economic problems of farmers and ranchers; to expand rural electrification through rea loans for generation and transmission, and to expand rural communication facilities, ’ to continue the improvement of rural mail delivery to farm families; to promote fully the republican-sponsored rural-development program to broaden the opera- tion and increase the income of low income farm families and help tenant farmers; to work with farmers, ranchers and others to carry forward the great plains program to achieve wise use of lands in the area subject to wind erosion, so that the people of this region can enjoy a higher standard of living; and in sum- mation: to keep agriculture strong, free, attuned to peace and not war, to stand ready with a reserve capacity at all times as a part of our defense, based on sound agricultural economy. we are an expanding nation. our needs for farm products will continue to grow. farm prices are improving and farm income is climbing. our farm and ranch people are confident of the future, despite efforts to frighten them into accepting economic nostrums and political pana- ceas. record numbers of farms are owned by those who operate them. , the republican party is pledged to work for improved farm prices and farm income. we will seek that improvement boldly, in ways that pro- tect the family farm. our objective is a pros- perous, expanding and free agriculture. we are dedicated to creating the opportunity for farmers to earn a high per-family income in a world at peace. feperat government integrity the republican party is wholeheartedly com- mitted to maintaining a federal government that is clean, honorable and increasingly efficient. it proudly affirms that it has achieved this kind of government and dedicated it to the service of all the people. our many economic and social advances of the past four years are the result of our faithful adherence to our pledge to reverse a -year democratic philosophy calling for more and more power in washington. we have left no stone unturned to remove from government the irresponsible and_ those whose employment was not clearly consistent with national security. we believe that working for the government is not a right but a privilege. based on that princi- ple we will continue a security program to make certain that all people employed by our govem- ment ure of unquestioned loyalty and trustworthi- ness. the republican party will, realistically and in conformity with constitutional safeguards for the individual, continue to protect our national security by enforcing our laws fairly, vigorously, and with certainty. we will act through the new division established to this end in the department of justice, and by close coordination among the intelligence services. we promise unwavering vigilance against cor- ruption and waste, and shall continue so to manage the public business as to warrant our people's full confidence in the integrity of their government. we condemn illegal lobbying for any cause and improper use of money in political activities, in- cluding the use of funds collected by compulsion for political purposes contrary to the personal desires of the individual. efficiency and economy in government. we pledge to continue our tar reaching program for improving the efficiency and the effectiveness of the federal government in accordance with the principles set forth in the report of the hoover commission. we are unalterably opposed to unwarranted growth otf centralized federal power. we shall carry forward the worthy effort of the kestnbaum commission on intergovernmental affairs to clarify federal relationships and strengthen state and local government. we shall continue to dispense with federal activities wrongfully competing with private enterprise, and take other sound measures to reduce the cost of government. governmental affairs postal service. in the last four vears, under direction from president eisenhower to improve the postal service and reduce costs, we have modernized and revitalized the postal establish- ment from top to bottom, inside and out. we have undertaken and substantially completed the largest reorganization ever to take place in any unit of business or government: we have provided more than badly- needed new post office buildings, and are adding two more every day. we are using the very latest types of industrial equipment where practicable; and, through a program of research and engineer- ing, we are inventing new mechanical and elec- tronic devices to speed the movement of mail by eliminating tedious old-fashioned methods. we have improved service across the country in hundreds of wavs. we have extended city carrier service to millions. of new homes in thousands of urban and suburban communities which have grown and spread under the favor- able economic conditions brought about by the- eisenhower administration. we have re-inspired the morale of our half- million employees through new programs of pro- motion based on ability, job training and safety, campaign of and through our sponsorship of increased pay and fringe benefits. we have adopted the most modern methods of transportation, accounting and cost control, and other operating procedures; through them we have saved many millions of dollars a year for the taxpayers while advancing the delivery of billions of letters by a day or more—all this while re- ducing the enormous deficit c: the department from its all time high of almost three-quarters of a billion dollars in to less than half that amount in . we pledge to continue our efforts, blocked by the democratic leadership of the 84th congress, for a financially sound, more nearly self-sustain- ing postal service—with the users of the mails paying a greater share of the costs instead of the taxpayers bearing the burden of huge postal deficits. we pledge to continue and to complete this vitally needed program of modernization of build- ings, equipment, methods and service, so that the american people will receive the kind of mail delivery they deserve—the speediest and best that american ingenuity, technology and modern business management can provide. civil service. we will vigorously promote, as we have in the past, a non-political career service under the merit system which will attract and retain able servants of the people. many gains in this field, notably pay increases and a host of new benefits, have been achieved in their behalf in less than four years. the republican party will continue to fight for eagerly desired new advances for government employees, and realistic reappraisement and ad- justment of benefits for our retired civil service personnel, statehood for alaska and hawaii. we pledge immediate statehood for alaska, recognizing the fact that adequate provision for defense require- ments must be made. we pledge immediate statehood for hawaii. puerto rico, we shall continue to encourage the commonwealth of puerto rico in its political growth and economic development in accordance with the wishes of its people and the fundamental principle of self-determination. indian affairs. we shall continue to pursue our enlightened policies which are now producing exceptional advances in the long struggle to help national party platforms the american indian gain the material and social advantages of his birthright and citizenship, while maintaining to the fullest extent the cul- tural integrity of the various tribal groups. we commend the present administration for its progressive programs which have achieved such striking progress in preparing our indian citizens for participation in normal community life. health. educational and employment oppor- tunities for indians have been greatly expanded hovend any previous level, and we favor still turther extensions of these programs. we favor most sympathetic and constructive execution of the federal trusteeship over indian affairs, always in full consultation with indians in the management of their interests and the ex- pansion of their rights of self-government in local and tribal affairs. we urge the prompt adjudication or settlement of pending indian claims. district of columbia. we favor self-govern- ment, national suffrage and representation in the congress of the united states for residents of the district of columbia. equal rights. we recommend to congress the submission of a constitutional amendment pro- viding equal rights for men and women. eoval opportunity and justice civit rights the republican party points to an impressive record of accomplishment in the field of civil rights and commits itself anew to advancing the rights of all our people regardless of race, creed, color or national origin. in the area of exclusive federal jurisdiction, more progress has been made in this field under the present republican administration than in any similar period in the last years. the many negroes who have been appointed to high public positions have played a significant part in the progress of this administration. segregation has been ended in the district of columbia government and in the district public facilities including public schools, restaurants, theaters and playgrounds. the eisenhower ad- ministration has eliminated discrimination in all federal employment. great progress has been made in eliminating employment discrimination on the part of those who do business with the federal government and secure federal contracts. this administra. tion has impartially enforced federal civil rights statutes, and we pledge that we will continue to do so. we support the enactment of the civil rights program already presented by the presi. dent to the second session of the s4th congress, the regulatory agencies under this adminis. tration have moved vigorously to end discrimina- tion in interstate commerce. segregation in the active arm: * forces of the united states ts been ended. for the first time in our history there is no segregation in veterans’ hospitals and among civilians on naval bases. this is an imoressive record. we pledge ourselves to continued prog- ress in this field. the republican party has unequivocally recog- nized that the supreme law of the land is em- bodied in the constitution, which guarantees to all people the blessings of liberty, due process and equal protection of the laws. it confers upon all native-born and naturalized citizens not only citizenship in the state where the individual resides but citizenship of the united states as well. this is an unqualified right, regardless of race, creed or color. the republican party accepts the decision of the u.s. supreme court that racial discrimina- tion in publicly supported schools must be pro- gressively eliminated. we concur in the con- clusion of the supreme court that its decision directing school desegregation should be ac- complished with “all deliberate speed” locally through federal district courts. the implementa- tion order of the supreme court recognizes the complex and acutely emotional problems created by its decision in certain sections of our country where racial patterns have been developed in accordance with prior and longstanding decisions of the same tribunal. we believe that true progress can be attained through intelligent study, understanding, educa- tion and good will. use of force or violence by any group or agency will tend only to worsen the many problems inherent in the situation. this progress must be encouraged and the work of the courts supported in every legal manner by all branches of the federal government to the end that the constitutional ideal of equality before the law, regardless of race, creed or color, will be steadily achieved. immigration the republican party supports an immigration policy which is in keeping with the traditions of america in providing a haven for oppressed peoples, and which is based on equality of treat- ment, freedom from implications of discrimina- tion between racial, natio:ity and religious groups. and flexible enough to conform to changing needs and conditions. we believe that such a policy serves our self- interest, reflects our responsibility for world leadership and develops maximum cooperation with other nations in resolving problems in this area. we support the president’s program submitted to the 84th congress to carry out needed modifi- cations in existing law and to take such further steps as mav be necessary to carry out our tra- ditional policy. in that concept, this republican administration sponsored the refugee relief act to provide asylum for thousands of refugees, expellees and displaced persons, and undertook in the face of democrat opposition to correct the inequities in existing law and to bring our immigration policies in line with the dynamic needs of the country and principles of equity and justice. we believe also that the congress should con- sider the extension of the refugee relief act of in resolving this dificult refugee problem which resulted from world conflict. to all this we give our wholehearted support. human freedom and peace under the leadership of president eisenhower, the united states has advanced foreign policies which enable our people to enjoy the blessings of liberty and peace. the changes in the international scene have been so great that it is easy to forget the con- ditions we inherited in . peace, so hardly won in , had again been lost. the korean war, with its tragic toll of more than an eighth of a million american casualties, seemed destined to go on indefinitely. its material costs and accompanying inflation were under- mining our economy. . freedom was under assault, and despotism was on the march. armed conflict continued in the far east, and tensions mounted elsewhere. the threat of global war increased daily. campaign of § international communism which, in , ruled the million people in the soviet union and baltic states. was conquering so that, by , it dominate. ore than million people in once-independent nations. today. now, we are at peace. the korean war has been ended. the communist agg-essors have been denied their goals. the threat of global war has receded. the advance of communism has been checked, and, at key points, thrown back. the once- monolithic structure of international communism, denied the stimulant of successive conquests, has shown hesitancy both internally and abroad. the far east, the korean war was brought to a close when the communist rulers were made to realize that they could not win. the united states has made a collective defense treaty with the republic of korea which will exclude, for the future, the communist mis- calculation as to announced american interests and intentions which jed to the original ag- gression. the united states has made a security treaty with the republic of china covering formosa and the pescadores; and the congress, by virtually unanimous action, has authorized the president to employ the armed forces of the united states to defend this area. as a result, the chinese communists have not attempted to implement their announced intention to take formosa by force. in indochina, the republics of vietnam and cambodia and laos are now free and independ- ent nations. the republic of vietnam, with the united states assistance, has denied the com- munists the gains which they expected from the withdrawal of french forces. the security of southeast asia has now been bolstered by the collective-defense system of seato, and its peoples encouraged by the declarations in the pacific charter of the prin- ciples of equal rights and self-determination of peoples. the middle east and southeast asia. the middle east has been strengthened by the de- fensive unity of the four “northern tier” countries —turkey, iraq, iran and pakistan—which hold gateways to the vast oil resources upon which depend the industry and military strength of the free world. this was made possible by the national party platforms liberation of iran from the grip of the communist tudeh party. iran has again made its oil reserves available to the world under an equitable settle- ment negotiated by the united states. we have maintained, and will maintain, friendly relations with all nations in this vital area, seeking to mediate differences among them, and encouraging their legitimate national aspira- tions. europe. in western europe, the scene has been transformed. the federal republic of germany, which until was denied sover- eignty and the opportunity to join the north atlantic treaty organization, has now had full sovereignty restored by the treaties of , and has become a member of nato despite the intense opposition of the soviet union. nato itself has been strengthened by de- veloping reliance upon new weapons and retalia- tory power, thus assisting the nato countries increasingly to attain both economic welfare and adequate military defense. on our initiative, the political aspects of nato are being developed. instead of being merely a military alliance, nato will provide a means for coordinating the policies of the member states on vital matters, such as the reunification of ger- many, the liberation of the satellites, and general policies in relation to the soviet union. austria has been liberated. the freedom treaty, blocked since by the soviet union, was signed in . for the first time since the end of world war ii, red army forces in europe evacuated occupied lands. the emotion-charged dispute between italy and yugoslavia about trieste was settled with the active participation of the united states. the city of trieste was restored to italian sovereignty, and united states and british forces withdrawn. the spanish base negotiations, which had long languished, were successfully concluded, and close working relations in this important respect established between the united states and spain. the americas. our good neighbor policy con- tinues to prove its wisdom. ; the american republics have taken effective steps against the cancer of communism. at the caracas conference of march, , they agreed that if international communism gained control of the political institutions of any american re- public, this would endanger them all, and would call for collective measures to remove the danger. this new doctrine, first proposed by the united states, extends into modern times the principles of the monroe doctrine. a first fruit of the caracas doctrine was the expulsion of the communist regime ruling guate- mala. today, guatemala is liberated from krem- lin control. the organization of american states has grown in vigor. it has acted promptly and effectively to settle hemispheric disputes. in costa rica, for the first time in history, inter- national aerial inspection was employed to main- tain peace. the panama conference was probably the most successful in the long history of the organization of american states in its promotion of good will, understanding and friendship. relations with soviet russia. far-reaching steps have been taken to eliminate the danger of a third world war. president eisenhower led the way at geneva. there he impressed the soviet leaders and the world with the dedication of the united states to peace, but also with its determination not to purchase peace at the price of freedom. that summit conference set new forces into motion. the soviet rulers professed to renounce the use of violence, which stalin had made basic in the communist doctrine. then followed a repudiation of stalin, the growth of doctrinal disputes within the communist party, and a dis- crediting of party authority and its evil power. forces of liberalism within the soviet bloc chal- lenge the brutal and atheistic doctrines of soviet communism. for the first time, we see positive evidence that forces of freedom and liberation will inevitably prevail if the free nations maintain their strength, unity and resolution. the future. we re-dedicate ourselves to the pursuit of a just peace and the defense of human liberty and national independence. we shall continue vigorously to support the united nations. we shall continue our cooperation with our sister states of the americas for the strengthening of our security, economic and social ties with them. we shall continue to support the collective- security system begun in and steadily de- veloped on a bipartisan basis. that system has joined the united states with other nations in common defense of freedom. it has created su ar ir w q pe re of a deterrent to war which cannot be nullified by soviet veto. where needed. we shall help friendly countries maintain such local forces and economic strength as provide a first bulwark against communist aggression or subversion. we shall reinforce that defense by a litary capacity which, operating in accordance with the united nations charter, could so punish aggression that it ceases to be a profitable pursuit. we will continue efforts with friends and allies to assist the underdeveloped areas of the free world in their efforts to attain greater freedom, independence and self-determination, and to raise their standards of living. we recognize the existence of a major threat to international peace in the near east. we sup- port a policy of impartial friendship for the peoples of the arab states and israel to promote a peaceful settlement of the causes of tension in that area, including the human problem of the palestine-arab refugees. progress toward a just settlement of the tragic conflict between the jewish state and the arab nations in palestine was upset by the soviet bloc sale of arms to arab countries. but prospects of peace have now been reinforced by the mission to palestine of the united nations secretary general upon the initiative of the united states. we regard the preservation of israel as an im ortant tenet of american foreign policy. we are determined that the integrity of an inde- pendent jewish state shall be maintained. we shall support the independence of israel against armed aggression. the best hope for peace in the middle east lies in the united nations. we pledge our continued efforts to eliminate the obstacles to a lasting peace in this area. we shall continue to seek the reunification of germany in freedom, and the liberation of the satellite states—poland, czechoslovakia, hungary, rumania, bulgaria, latvia, lithuania, estonia and other, once-free countries now behind the iron curtain. the republican party stands firmly with the peoples of these countries in their just quest for freedom. we are confident that our peaceful policies, resolutely pursued, will finally restore freedom and national independence to oppressed peoples and nations. we continue to oppose the seating of com- munist china in the united nations, thus up- campaign of holding international morality. to seat a com- munist china which defies, by word and deed, the principles of the united nations charter would be to betray the letter, violate the spirit and subvert the purposes of that charter. it would betray our friend and ally, the republic of china. we will continue our detennind efforts to free the remaining americans held prisoner by communist china. recognizing economic health as an indis- pensable basis of military strength and world peace, we shall strive to foster abroad and to practice at home. policies to encourage produc- tivity and profitable trade. barriers which impede internation..' trade and the how of capital should be reduced on a gradual, selective and reciprocal basis, with full recognition of the necessity to safeguard domestic enterprises, agriculture and labor against unfair import competition. we proudly point out that the republican party was primarily responsible for initiating the escape clause and peril point provisions of law to make effective the necessary safeguards for american agriculture, labor and business. we pledge faithful and expeditious administration of these provisions. we are against any trade with the communist world that would threaten the security of the united states and our allies. we recognize that no single nation can alone defend the liberty of all nations threatened by communist aggression or subversion. mutual security means effective mutual cooperation. poverty and unrest in less developed countries make them the target for international com- munism. we must help them achieve the eco- nomic growth and stability necessary to attain and preserve their independence. technical and economic assistance programs are effective countermeasures to soviet economic offensives and propaganda. they provide the best way to create the political and social stability essential to lasting peace. we will strive to bring about conditions that will end the injustices of nations divided against their will, of nattons held subject to foreign domination, of peoples deprived of the right of self-government. we reaffirm the principle of freedom for all peoples, and look forward to the eventual end of colonialism. national party platforms we will overlook no opportunity that, with prudence. can be taken to bring about a pro- gressive elimination of the barriers that interfere with the free flow of news, information and ideas, and the exchange of persons between the free peoples and the captive peoples of the world. we favor the continuance and development of the “exchange-of-persons” programs between free nations. we approve appropriate action to oppose the imposition by foreign governments of discrimina- tion against united states citizens, based on their religion or race. we shall continue the bipartisan development of foreign policies. we hold this necessary if those policies are to have continuity, and be re- garded by other free nations as dependable. the republican party pledges itself to continue the dynamic, courageous, sound and _ patriotic policies which have protected and promoted the interests of the united states during the past four years. in a world fraught with peril, peace can be won and preserved only by vigilance and inspired leadership. in such a world, we believe it is essential that the vast experience of our proven leader, president dwight d. eisenhower, con- tinues to guide our country in the achievement and maintenance of a just, honorable and durable peace. bulwark for the free woritp-—-our national defense the military strength of the united states has been a key factor in the preservation of world peace during the past four years. we are determined to maintain that strength so long as our security and the peace of the world require it. this administration, within six months after president eisenhower's inauguration, ended the war in korea by concluding an honorable armi- stice. the lesson of that war and our lack of preparedness which brought it about will not be forgotten. such mistakes must not be repeated. as we maintain and strengthen the security of this nation, we shall, consistent with this ad- ministration’s dedication to peace, strive for the acceptance of realistic proposals for disarmament and the humanitarian control of weapons of mass destruction. our country’s defense posture is today a visible and powerful deterrent against attack by any enemy, from any quarter, at any time. we have the strongest striking force in the world—in the air—on the sea—and a magnificent supporting land force in our army and marine corps. such visible and powerful deterrents must continue to include: a) a jet-powered, long-range strategic air force, and a tactical air force of the fastest and very latest type aircraft, with a striking capability superior to any other; b) the most effective guided and _ ballistic missiles; c) a modem navy, with a powerful naval aircraft arm prepared to keep the sea lanes open to meet any assignment; d) an army whose mobility and unit fire- power are without equal; e) bases, strategically dispersed at home and around the world, essential to all these operations. we will maintain and improve the effective strength and state of readiness of all these armed forces. to achieve this objective, we must depend upon attracting to, and retaining in our military services vigorous and well-trained manpower, and upon continuously maintaining in reserve, an enthusiastic and well-informed group of men and women. this will require incentives that will make armed service careers attractive and re- warding. a substantial start has been made toward bolstering the rewards and benefits that accompany a military career. we must continue to provide them. in order that american youth in our armed services shall be provided with the most modern weapons, we have supported and will continue to support an effective and well-directed program of research and development, staffed by men of the highest caliber and ability in this field. there is no substitute for the best where the lives of our men and the defense of our nation are concerned. we fully appreciate ‘he importance of scientific knowledge and its appiication particularly in the military field. we pledge ourselves to stimulate and en- courage the education of our young people in the sciences with a determination to maintain our technological leadership. in this age of weapons of inconceivable destruc- tiveness, we must not neglect the protection of the civilian population by all known means, while, at the same time, preparing our armed forces for every eventuality. we wholeheartedly agree with president eisen- hower that our military defense must be backed by a strong civil defense, and that an effective civil defense is an important deterrent against attack upon our country, and an indispensable reliance should our nation ever be attacked. we support his proposals for strengthening civil defense, mindful that it has become an effective government arm to deal with natural disasters. we shall continue to carry forward, vigorously and effectively, the valued services of the federal bureau of investigation, as well as all other government intelligence agencies, so as to insure that we are protected at all times against sub- versive activities. we will never relax our de- termined efforts to keep our government, and our people, safely guarded against all enemies from within, we agree and assert that civilian authority and control over our defense structure and program must be ma-ntained at all times. we believe, without qualification, that in our present com- mander-in-chief, dwight d. eisenhower, this nation possesses a leader equipped by training, temperament, and experience in war and in peace, for both that personal example and that direction of our national defense in which the american people will continue to have confidence, and in which the peoples of all the free world will find an increasing sense of security and of an oppor- tunity for peace. veterans we believe that active duty in the armed forces during a state of war or national emergency is the highest call of citizenship constituting a special service to our nation and entitles those who have served to positive assistance to alleviate the injuries, hardships and handicaps imposed by their service. . in recognizing this principle under previous republican administrations we established the veterans administration. this republican ad- ministration increased compensation and pension benefits for veterans and survivors to provide more adequate levels and to off-set cost of living campaign of increases that occurred during the most recent democratic administration. we have also improved quality of hospital service and have established a long-range program for continued improvement of such service. we have strengthened and extended survivors’ bene- fits, thus affording greater security for all veterans in the interest of equity and justice. in advancing this republican program we pledge: that compensation for injuries and disease arising out of service be fairly and generously provided for all disabled veterans and for their dependents or survivors; that a pension program for disabled war veterans in need and for their widows and orphans in need be maintained as long as necessary to assure them adequate income; that all veterans be given equal and adequate opportunity for readjustment following service, including unemployment compensation when needed, but placing emphasis on obtaining suit- able employment for veterans, particularly those disabled, by using appropriate facilities of gov- ernment and by assuring that federal employment preference and re-employment rights, to which the veteran is entitled, are received; that the veterans administration be continued as a single independent agency providing veter- ans services; that the service-disabled continue to receive first-priority medical services of the highest stand- ard and that non-service disabled war veterans in need receive hospital care to the extent that beds are available. guarping and imprroving our reesounces one of the brightest areas of achievement and progress under the eisenhower administration has been in resource conservation and develop- ment and in sound, long-range public works programing. policies of sound conservation and wise de- velopment—originally advanced half a century ago under that pre-eminent republican conserva- tion team of president theodore roosevelt and gifford pinchot and amplified by succeeding re- publican administrations—have been pursued by the eisenhower administration, while meeting the essential development needs of the people, this administration has conserved and safeguarded national party platforms our natural resources for the greatest good of all, now and in the future. our national parks, national forests and wild- life refuges are now more adequately financed, better protected and more extensive than ever before. long-range improvement programs, such as mission for the national parks system, are now under way. and studies are nearing com- pletion for a comparable program for the national forests. these forward-looking programs will be aggressively continued. our republican administration has modernized and vitalized our mining laws by the first major revision in more than years. recreation, parks and wildlife. achieve- ments: reversed the -year trend of neglect of our national parks by launching the -year, $ million mission parks improvement pro- gram. has nearly completed field surveys for a comparable forest improvement program. ob- tained passage of the so-called “week-end miner bill.” added more than , acres to our national park system, and , acres to wildlife refuges. has undertaken well-conceived measures to protect reserved areas of all types and to pro- vide increased staffs and operating funds for public recreation agencies. we favor full recognition of recreation as an important public use of our national forests and public domain lands. we favor a comprehensive study of the effect upon wildlife of the drainage of our wetlands. we favor recognition, by the states, of wild- life and recreation management and conservation as a beneficial use of water. we subscribe to the general objectives of groups seeking to guard the beauty of our land and to promote clean, attractive surroundings throughout america. we recognize the need for maintaining isolated wilderness areas to provide opportunity for future generations to experience some of the wilderness living through which the traditional american spirit of hardihood was developed. public land and forest resources. achieve- ments: approved conservation programs of many types, including improvement of western grazing lands through reseeding programs, water- spreading systems, and encouragement of soil- and moisture-conservation practices by range users. returned to the states their submerged lands and resources of their coasts, out to their historical boundaries—an area comprising about one tenth of the area off the continental shelf and about per cent of the mineral resources. initiated leasing of the federally owned per cent of the continental shelf which is expected ultimately to bring from to billion dollars into the treasury and already has brought in over million dollars. enacted new legislation to en- courage multiple use of the public domain. we commend the eisenhower administration for its administration of our public lands and for elimination of bureaucratic abuses. we recom- mend continuing study and evaluation of the advisability of returning unused or inadequately used public lands. we commend the administration for expanding forest research and access road construction. we shall continue to improve timber conserva- tion practices, recreational facilities, grazing man- agement, and watershed protection of our national forests and our public domain. minerals. recognizing that a vigorous and efficient mineral industry is essential to the long- term development of the united states, and to its defense, we believe the federal government should foster a long-term policy for the develop- ment and prudent use of domestic mineral re- sources, and to assure access to necessary sources abroad, without dangerously weakening the mar- ket for domestic production of defense-essential materials. we favor reasonable depletion allowances. we favor freedom of mineral producers from un- necessary governmental regulation; expansion of government minerals exploration and research, and establishment of minerals stockpile objectives which will reduce, and, where possible, eliminate foreseeable wartime shortages. achievements: st. lawrence seaway and power projects, colorado river storage project, great lakes connecting channels, small watershed protection and flood prevention under local control, mississippi gulf level canal, ex- tension of water-pollution control program, sur- vey of power potential of passamaquoddy bay tides, expansion of small project development for flood control, navigation and reclamation; ex- tension to all states of water facilities act, accelerated research on saline water conversion, authorized planning surveys and construction of sr am wp ns = an | wi more than navigation, flood-control, beach erosion, rivers and harbors, reclamation, and watershed projects throughout the nation, ad- vanced partnership water resource developments in a number of states. water resources. water resource development legislation enacted under the eisenhower ad- ministration already has ushered in one of the greatest water resource development programs this nation has ever seen, a soundly-conceived construction program that will continue through- out this century and beyond. we recognize that the burgeoning growth of our nation requires a combination of federal, state and local water and power development— a real partnership of effort by all interested parties. in no other way can the nation meet the huge and accelerated demands for increasing generating capacity and uses of water, both by urban and agricultural areas. we also are aware that water demands have been accentuated by the ravages of drought, creating emergency conditions in many sections of our country. we commend the eisenhower administration for encouraging state and local governments, public agencies, and regulated private enterprise, to participate actively in comprehensive water and power development. in such partnership we are leading the way with great federal de- velopments such as the upper colorado project and with partnership projects of great importance, some of which have been shelved by the demo- cratic 84th congress. in the marketing of federally produced power we support preference to public bodies and co- operatives under the historic policy of the con- gress. we will continue to press for co-operative solution of all problems of water supply and distribution, reclamation, pollution, flood control, and saline-water conversion. we pledge legislative support to the arid and semi-arid states in preserving the integrity of their water laws and customs as developed out of the necessities of these regions. we affirm the his- . toric policy of congress recognizing state water rights, as repeatedly expressed in federal law over the past years. we pledge an expansion in research and planning of water resource development pro- grams, looking to the future when it may be campaign of necessary to re-distribute water from water-surplus areas to water-deficient areas. fisheries. achievements: accelerated re- search and administrative action to rehabilitate our long-neglected fishing industry. approval of measures for additional con: -vation and propaga- tion of fish. development ur the comprehensive program for fisheries management and assistance adopted by the congress. we favor continuation of the eisenhower pro- gram to rehabilitate our long-neglected domestic fishing industry. we advocate protective treaties insuring the united states commercial-fisheries industry against unfair foreign competition. the republican party is acutely aware that a foundation stone of the nation’s strength is its wealth of natural resources and the high develop- ment of its physical assets. they are the basis of our great progress in years of freedom and of our nation’s military and economic might. we pledge that we will continue the policies of sound conservation and wise development instituted by this administration to insure that our resources are managed as a beneficial trust for all the people. for «a brighter tomorrow atomic energy. the republican party pledges continuous, vigorous development of atomic energy: for the defense of our own country and to deter aggression, and for the promotion of world peace and the en- hancement of our knowledge of basic science and its application to industry, agriculture and the healing arts. from the passage of the first atomic energy act in to the beginning of this republican administration, a stalemate had existed, and only an arms race with the prospect of eventual ca- tastrophe faced the nations of the world. president eisenhower has inaugurated and led a strong program for developing the peaceful atom—a program which has captured the imagi- nation of men and women everywhere with its widespread, positive achievements. the government and private enterprise are working together on a number of large-scale projects designed to develop substantial quanti- ties of electric power from atomic sources. the national party platforms first power reactor will be completed next year. more and more private funds are being invested as the government monopoly is relaxed. in relaxing its monopoly, government can stimulate private enterprise to go ahead by taking recognition of the tremendous risks involved and — the complexity of the many technical problems that will arise, and assist in those ways that will make advances possible. the atomic energy commission also is en- couraging a vigorous rural electrification program by cooperatives. every day, radioactive isotopes are brought more and more into use on farms, in clinics and hospitals, and in industry. the use of isotopes already has resulted in annual savings of hundreds of millions of dollars and the nuclear age has only begun. it is to the benefit of the united states, as well as to all nations everywhere, that the uses of atomic energy be explored and shared. the republican party pledges that it will continue this imaginative, world-embracing program. we shall continue to chart our course so as to fortify the security of the free nations and to further the prosperity and progress of all people every- where. declaration of dedication with utmost confidence in the future and with justifiable pride in our achievements, the re- publican party warmly greets the dawn of our second century of service in the cause of unity and progress in the nation. as the party of the young and in glowing appreciation of his dynamic leadership and inspi- ration, we respectfully dedicate this platform of the party of the future to our distinguished president dwight d. eisenhower, and to the youth of america. socialist party platform: the socialist party is pledged to building a new, more democratic society in the united states; a society in which human rights come before property rights; a nation which can take its place in a world federation of cooperative commonwealths which will eliminate war, racial antagonism, hunger, disease, poverty and oppres- sion. the socialist party is pledged to building and to maintaining this new society by democratic means, for without freedom there can be no true socialism and without socialism there can be no enduring freedom. socialism is the social ownership and demo- cratic control of the means of production. social ownership, which includes cooperatives, is not usually government ownership. democratic con- trol is not administration by the central govern. ment but control by the people most directly affected and in the interest of all the people rather than for profit. the american people have already adopted many socialist measures to serve their needs when capitalism, with its profit mo- tive, failed them. in a big business economy, the claim that “free enterprise” and liberty go hand-in-hand is arrant nonsense. the power of monopoly is a threat to the democratic process. the right of the few to rob the many is a flagrant denial of freedom. not until the robbery is ended can we have liberty, equality and fraternity. the socialist party is committed to a policy of forthright, deliberate, planned introduction of socialism. creeping into socialism when capitalism fails does not promote the welfare of the people or preserve democracy and freedom. the socialist party of the united states is dedicated to building socialism in this strong- hold of capitalism because, even at its greatest. capitalism fails to satisfy the finest aspirations of its people. for war, it achieved great heights of productivity; for peace, it is incapable of equal performance. the development of the highest living standard in the world cannot excuse the inequality in division of wealth, which means that one family in ten receives an annual income of less than $, and more than two families in ten have less than $, per vear. in fact, the lower half of our population receives a smaller share of the total money income of the united states now than it did early in this century. our program is international as well as do- mestic. the american people do not share fairly in the wealth they themselves create; still less have the people of the underdeveloped areas been helped to pull themselves up to the level of decency which alone can provide the stability for enduring peace. the basic purpose of socialist foreign policy is to prevent another world war. the first step is to abolish every form of colonial-","['eee',
