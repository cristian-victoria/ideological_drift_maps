Democratic Party,1992,1990,dem_1992.csv,CSV,"A New Covenant with the American People Two hundred summers ago, this Democratic Party was founded by the man whose burning pen fired the spirit of the American Revolution - who once argued we should overthrow our own government every 20 years to renew our freedom and keep pace with a changing world. In 1992, the party Thomas Jefferson founded invokes his spirit of revolution anew. Our land reverberates with a battle cry of frustration that emanates from America's very soul - from the families in our bedrock neighborhoods, from the unsung, workaday heroes of the world's greatest democracy and economy. America is on the wrong track. The American people are hurting. The American Dream of expanding opportunity has faded. Middle class families are working hard, playing by the rules, but still falling behind. Poverty has exploded. Our people are torn by divisions. The last 12 years have been a nightmare of Republican irresponsibility and neglect. America's leadership is indifferent at home and uncertain in the world. Republican mismanagement has disarmed government as an instrument to make our economy work and support the people's most basic values, needs and hopes. The Republicans brought America a false and fragile prosperity based on borrowing, not income, and so will leave behind a mountain of public debt and a backbreaking annual burden in interest. It is wrong to borrow to spend on ourselves, leaving our children to pay our debts. We hear the anguish and the anger of the American people. We know it is directed not just at the Republican administrations that have had power, but at government itself. Their anger is justified. We can no longer afford business as usual -- neither the policies of the last 12 years of tax breaks for the rich, mismanagement, lack of leadership and cuts in services for the middle class and the poor, nor the adoption of new programs and new spending without new thinking. It is time to listen to the grassroots of America, time to renew the spirit of citizen activism that has always been the touchstone of a free and democratic society. Therefore we call for a revolution in government - to take power away from entrenched bureaucracies and narrow interests in Washington and put it back in the hands of ordinary people. We vow to make government more decentralized, more flexible, and more accountable - to reform public institutions and replace public officials who aren't leading with ones who will. The Revolution of 1992 is about restoring America's economic greatness. We need to rebuild America by abandoning the something-for-nothing ethic of the last decade and putting people first for a change. Only a thriving economy, a strong manufacturing base, and growth in creative new enterprise can generate the resources to meet the nation's pressing human and social needs. An expanding, entrepreneurial economy of high-skill, high-wage jobs is the most important family policy, urban policy, labor policy, minority policy and foreign policy America can have. The Revolution of 1992 is about putting government back on the side of working men and women - to help those who work hard, pay their bills, play by the rules, don't lobby for tax breaks, do their best to give their kids a good education and to keep them away from drugs, who want a safe neighborhood for their families, the security of decent, productive jobs for themselves, and a dignified life for their parents. The Revolution of 1992 is about a radical change in the way government operates - not the Republican proposition that government has no role, nor the old notion that there's a program for every problem, but a shift to a more efficient, flexible and results-oriented government that improves services, expands choices, and empowers citizens and communities to change our country from the bottom up. We believe in an activist government, but it must work in a different, more responsive way. The Revolution of 1992 is about facing up to tough choices. There is no relief for America's frustration in the politics of diversion and evasion, of false choices or of no choices at all. Instead of everyone in Washington blaming one another for inaction, we will act decisively -- and ask to be held accountable if we don't. Above all the Revolution of 1992 is about restoring the basic American values that built this country and will always make it great: personal responsibility, individual liberty, tolerance, faith, family and hard work. We offer the American people not only new ideas, a new course, and a new President, but a return to the enduring principles that set our nation apart: the promise of opportunity, the strength of community, the dignity of work, and a decent life for senior citizens. To make this revolution, we seek a New Covenant to repair the damaged bond between the American people and their government, that will expand opportunity, insist upon greater individual responsibility in return, restore community, and ensure national security in a profoundly new era. We welcome the close scrutiny of the American people, including Americans who may have thought the Democratic Party had forgotten its way, as well as all who know us as the champions of those who have been denied a chance. With this platform we take our case for change to the American people. I. OPPORTUNITY Our Party's first priority is opportunity -- broad- based, non-inflationary economic growth and the opportunity that flows from it. Democrats in 1992 hold nothing more important for America than an economy that offers growth and jobs for all. President Bush, with no interest in domestic policy, has given America the slowest economic growth, the slowest income growth, and the slowest jobs growth since the Great Depression. And the American people know the long Bush recession reflects not just a business cycle, but a long-term slide, so that even in a fragile recovery we're sinking. The ballooning Bush deficits hijacked capital from productive investments. Savings and loan sharks enriched themselves at their country's expense. The stock market tripled, but average incomes stalled, and poverty claimed more of our children. We reject both the do-nothing government of the last twelve years and the big government theory that says we can hamstring business and tax and spend our way to prosperity. Instead we offer a third way. Just as we have always viewed working men and women as the bedrock of our economy, we honor business as a noble endeavor, and vow to create a far better climate for firms and independent contractors of all sizes that empower their workers, revolutionize their workplaces, respect the environment, and serve their communities well. We believe in free enterprise and the power of market forces. But economic growth will not come without a national economic strategy to invest in people. For twelve years our country has had no economic vision, leadership or strategy. It is time to put our people and our country first. Investing in America. The only way to lay the foundation for renewed American prosperity is to spur both public and private investment. We must strive to close both the budget deficit and the investment gap. Our major competitors invest far more than we do in roads, bridges, and the information networks and technologies of the future. We will rebuild America by investing more in transportation, environmental technologies, defense conversion, and a national information network. To begin making our economy grow, the President and Congress should agree that savings from defense must be reinvested productively at home, including research, education and training, and other productive investments. This will sharply increase the meager nine percent of the national budget now devoted to the future. We will create a ""future budget"" for investments that make us richer, to be kept separate from those parts of the budget that pay for the past and present. For the private sector, instead of a sweeping capital gains windfall to the wealthy and those who speculate, we will create an investment tax credit and a capital gains reduction for patient investors in emerging technologies and new businesses. Support for Innovation. We will take back the advantage now ceded to Japan and Germany, which invest in new technologies at higher rates than the U. S.  and have the growth to show for it. We will make the R&;D tax credit permanent, double basic research in the key technologies for our future, and create a civilian research agency to fast-forward their development. The deficit. Addressing the deficit requires fair and shared sacrifice of all Americans for the common good. In 12 Republican years a national debt that took 200 years to accumulate has been quadrupled. Rising interest on that debt now swallows one tax dollar in seven. In place of the Republican supply-side disaster, the Democratic investment, economic conversion and growth strategy will generate more revenues from a growing economy. We must also tackle spending, by putting everything on the table; eliminate nonproductive programs; achieve defense savings; reform entitlement programs to control soaring health care costs; cut federal administrative costs by 3 percent annually for four years; limit increases in the ""present budget"" to the rate of growth in the average American's paycheck; apply a strict ""pay as you go"" rule to new non-investment spending; and make the rich pay their fair share in taxes. These choices will be made while protecting senior citizens and without further victimizing the poor. This deficit reduction effort will encourage private savings, eliminate the budget deficit over time, and permit fiscal policies that can restore America's economic health. Defense Conversion. Our economy needs both the people and the funds released from defense at the Cold War's end. We will help the stalwarts of that struggle -- the men and women who served in our armed forces and who work in our defense industries – make the most of a new era. We will provide early notice of program changes to give commun ties, businesses and workers enough time to plan. We will honor and support our veterans. Departing military personnel, defense workers, and defense support personnel will have access to job retraining, continuing education, placement and relocation assistance, early retirement benefits for military personnel, and incentives to enter teaching, law enforcement and other vital civilian fields. Redirected national laboratories and a new civilian research agency will put defense scientists, engineers and technicians to work in critical civilian technologies. Small business defense firms will have technical assistance and transition grants and loans to help convert to civilian markets, and defense dependent communities will have similar aid in planning and implementing conversion. We will strongly support our civilian space program, particularly environmental missions. The Cities. Only a robust economy will revitalize our cities. It is in all Americans' interest that the cities once again be places where hard-working families can put down roots and find good jobs, quality health care, affordable housing, and decent schools. Democrats will create a new partnership to rebuild America's cities after 12 years of Republican neglect. This partnership with the mayors will include consideration of the seven economic growth initiatives set forth by our nation's mayors. We will create jobs by investing significant resources to put people back to work, beginning with a summer jobs initiative and training programs for inner-city youth. We support a stronger community development program and targeted fiscal assistance to cities that need it most. A national public works investment and infrastructure program will provide jobs and strengthen our cities, suburbs, rural communities and country. We will encourage the flow of investment to inner city development and housing through targeted enterprise zones and incentives for private and public pension funds to invest in urban and rural projects. While cracking down on redlining and housing discrimination, we also support and will enforce a revitalized Community Reinvestment Act that challenges banks to lend to entrepreneurs and development projects; a national network of Community Development Banks to invest in urban and rural small businesses; and microenterprise lending for poor people seeking self-employment as an alternative to we fare. Agriculture and the Rural Community. All Americans, producers and consumers alike, benefit when our food and fiber are produced by hundreds of thousands of family farmers r ceiving fair prices for their products. The abundance of our nation's food and fiber system should not be taken for granted. The revolution that lifted America to the forefront of world agriculture was achieved through a unique partnership of public and private interests. The inattention and hostility that has characterized Republican food, agricultural and rural development policies of the past twelve years have caused a crisis in rural America. The cost of Republican farm policy has been staggering and its total failure is demonstrated by the record number of rural bankruptcies. A sufficient and sustainable agricultural economy can be achieved through fiscally responsible programs. It is time to reestablish the private/public partnership to ensure that family farmers get a fair return for their labor and investment, so that consumers receive safe and nutritious foods, and that needed investments are made in basic research, education, rural business development, market development and infrastructure to sustain rural communities. Workers' Rights. Our workplaces must be revolutionized to make them more flexible and productive. We will reform the job safety laws to empower workers with greater rights and to hold employers accountable for dangers on the job. We will act against sexual ha assment in the workplace. We will honor the work ethic -- by expanding the earned income tax credit so no one with children at home who works full-time is still in poverty; by fighting on the side of family farmers to ensure they get a fair price for their hard work; by working to sustain rural communities; by making work more valuable than welfare; and by supporting the right of workers to organize and bargain collectively without fear of intimidation or permanent replacement during labor disputes. Lifelong Learning. A competitive American economy requires the global market's best educated, best trained, most flexible workforce. It's not enough to spend more on our schools; we must insist on results. We oppose the Bush Administration's efforts to bankrupt the public school system - the bedrock of democracy - through private school vouchers. To help children reach school ready to learn, we will expand child health and nutrition programs and extend Head Start to all eligible children, and guarantee all children access to quality, affordable child care. We deplore the savage inequalities among public schools across the land, and believe every child deserves an equal chance to a world class education. Reallocating resources toward this goal must be a priority. We support education reforms such as site-based decision-making and public school choice, with strong protections against discrimination. We support the goal of a 90 percent graduation rate, and programs to end dropouts. We will invest in educational technology, and establish world-class standards in math, science and other core subjects and support effective tests of progress to meet them. In areas where there are no registered apprenticeship programs, we will adopt a national apprenticeship-style program to ease the transition from school to work for non-college bound students so they can acquire skills that lead to high-wage jobs. In the new economy, opportunity will depend on lifelong learning. We will support the goal of literacy for all Americans. We will ask firms to invest in the training of all workers, not just corporate management. A Domestic GI Bill. Over the past twelve years skyrocketing costs and declining middle class incomes have placed higher education out of reach for millions of Americans. It is time to revolutionize the way student loan programs are run. We will make college affordable to all students who are qualified to attend, regardless of family income. A Domestic G.I Bill will enable all Americans to borrow money for college, so long as they are willing to pay it back as a percentage of their income over time or through national service addressing u met community needs. Affordable Health Care. All Americans should have universal access to quality, affordable health care -- not as a privilege, but as a right. That requires tough controls on health costs, which are rising at two to three times the rate of inflation, terrorizing American families and businesses and depriving millions of the care they need. We will enact a uniquely American reform of the health care system to control costs and make health care affordable; ensure quality and choice of health care providers; cover all Americans regardless of preexisting conditions; squeeze out waste, bureaucracy and abuse; improve primary and preventive care including child immunization and prevention of diseases like Tuberculosis now becoming rampant in our cities; provide expanded education on the relationship between diet and health; expand access to mental health treatment services; provide a safety net through support of public hospitals; provide for the full range of reproductive choice -- education, counseling, access to contraceptives, and the right to a safe, legal abortion; expand medical research; and provide more long term care, including home health care. We will make ending the epidemic in breast cancer a major priority, and expand research on breast, cervical and ovarian cancer, infertility, reproductive health services and other special health needs of women. We must be united in declaring war on AIDS and HIV disease, implement the recommendations of the National Commission on AIDS and fully fund the Ryan White Care Act; provide targeted and honest prevention campaigns; combat HIV-related discrimination; make drug treatment available for all addicts who seek it; guarantee access to quality care; expand clinical trials for treatments and vaccines; and speed up the FDA drug approval process. Fairness. Growth and equity work in tandem. People should share in society's common costs according to their ability to pay. In the last decade, mounting payroll and other taxes have fallen disproportionately on the middle class. We will relieve the tax burden on middle class Americans by forcing the rich to pay their fair share. We will provide long-overdue tax relief to families with children. To broaden opportunity, we will support fair lending practices. Energy Efficiency and Sustainable Development. We reject the Republican myth that energy efficiency and environmental protection are enemies of economic growth. We will make our economy more efficient, by using less energy, reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and producing less solid and toxic waste. We will adopt a coordinated transportation policy, with a strong commitment to mass transit; encourage efficient alternative-fueled vehicles; increase our reliance on clean natural gas; promote clean coal technology; invest in R&;D on renewable energy sources; strengthen efforts to prevent air and water pollution; support incentives for domestic oil and gas operations; and push for revenue-neutral incentives that reward conservation, prevent pollution and encourage recycling. Civil and Equal Rights. We don't have an American to waste. Democrats will continue to lead the fight to ensure that no Americans suffer discrimination or deprivation of rights on the basis of race, gender, language, national origin, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, or other characteristics irrelevant to ability. We support the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment; affirmative action; stronger protection of voting rights for racial and ethnic minorities, including language access to voting; and continued resistance to discriminatory English-only pressure groups. We will reverse the Bush Administration's assault on civil rights enforcement, and instead work to rebuild and vigorously use machinery for civil rights enforcement; support comparable remedies for women; aggressively prosecute hate crimes; strengthen legal services for the poor; deal with other nations in such a way that Americans of any origin do not become scapegoats or victims of foreign policy disputes; provide civil rights protection for gay men and lesbians and an end to Defense Department discrimination; respect Native American culture and our treaty commitments; require the United States Government to recognize its trustee obligations to the inhabitants of Hawaii generally, and to Native Hawaiians in particular; and fully enforce the Americans with Dis bility Act to enable people with disabilities to achieve independence and function at their highest possible level. Commonwealths and Territories. We recognize the existing status of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the strong economic relationship between the people of Puerto Rico and the United States. We pledge to support the right of the people of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to choose freely, and in concert with the U.S. Congress, their relationship with the United States, either as an enhanced commonwealth, a state or an independent nation. We support fair participation for Puerto Rico in federal programs. We pledge to the people of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands just and fair treatment under federal policies, assisting their economic and social development. We respect their right and that of the people of Palau to decide freely their future relationship with the United States and to be consulted on issues and policies that directly affect them. II.RESPONSIBILITY Sixty years ago, Franklin Roosevelt gave hope to a nation mired in the Great Depression. While government should promise every American the opportunity to get ahead, it was the people's responsibility, he said, to make the most of that opportunity: ""Faith in America demands that we recognize the new terms of the old social contract. In the strength of great hope we must all shoulder our common load. For twelve years, the Republicans have expected too little of our public institutions and placed too little faith in our people. We offer a new social contract based neither on callous, do-nothing Republican neglect, nor on an outdated faith in programs as the solution to every problem. We favor a third way beyond the old approaches -- to put government back on the side of citizens who play by the rules. We believe that by what it says and how it conducts its business, government must once again make responsibility an instrument of national purpose. Our future as a nation depends upon the daily assumption of personal responsibility by millions of Americans from all walks of life - for the religious faiths they follow, the ethics they practice, the values they instill, and the pride they take in their work. Strengthening The Family. Governments don't raise children, people do. People who bring children into this world have a responsibility to care for them and give them values, motivation and discipline. Children should not have children. We need a national crackdown on deadbeat parents, an effective system of child support enforcement nationwide, and a systematic effort to establish paternity for every child. We must also make it easier for parents to build strong families through pay equity. Family and medical leave will ensure that workers don't have to choose between family and work. We support a family preservation program to reduce child and spousal abuse by providing preventive services and foster care to families in crisis. We favor ensuring quality and affordable child care opportunities for working parents, and a fair and healthy start for every child, including essential pre-natal and well baby care. We support the needs of our senior citizens for productive and healthy lives, including hunger prevention, income adequacy, transportation access and abuse prevention. Welfare Reform. Welfare should be a second chance, not a way of life. We want to break the cycle of welfare by adhering to two simple principles: no one who is able to work can stay on welfare forever, and no one who works should live in poverty. We will continue to help those who cannot help themselves. We will offer people on welfare a new social contract. We'll invest in education and job training, and provide the child care and health care they need to go to work and achieve long-term self- sufficiency. We will give them the help they need to make the transition from welfare to work, and require people who can work to go to work within two years in available jobs either in the private sector or in community service to meet unmet needs. This will restore the covenant that welfare was meant to be: a promise of temporary help for people who have fallen on hard times. Choice. Democrats stand behind the right of every woman to choose, consistent with Roe v.Wade, regardless of ability to pay, and support a national law to protect that right. It is a fundamental constitutional liberty that individual Americans - not government - can best take responsibility for making the most difficult and intensely personal decisions regarding reproduction. The goal of our nation must be to make abortion less necessary, not more difficult or more dangerous. We pledge to support contraceptive research, family planning, comprehensive family life education, and policies that support healthy childbearing and enable parents to care most effectively for their children. Making Schools Work. Education is a cooperative enterprise that can only succeed if everyone accepts and exercises personal responsibility. Students must stay in school and do their best; parents must get involved in their children's education; teachers must attain, maintain, and demonstrate classroom competency; school administrators must enforce discipline and high standards of educational attainment; governments must end the inequalities that create educational ghettos among school districts and provide equal educational opportunity for all; and ensure that teachers' pay measures up to their decisive role in children's lives; and the American people should recognize education as the core of our economy, democracy and society. Labor-Management Responsibilities. The private sector is the engine of our economy and the main source of national wealth. But it is not enough for those in the private sector just to make as much money as they can. The most irresponsible people in all of the 1980s were those at the top of the ladder: the inside traders, quick buck artists, and S&;L kingpins who looked out for themselves and not for the country. America's corporate leaders have a responsibility to invest in their country. CEOs, who pay themselves 100 times what they pay the average worker, shouldn't get big raises unrelated to performance. If a company wants to overpay its executives and underinvest in the future or transfer jobs overseas, it shouldn't get special treatment and tax breaks from the Treasury. Managers must work with employees to make the workplace safer, more satisfying and more efficient. Workers must also accept added responsibilities in the new economy. In return for an I creased voice and a greater stake in the success of their enterprises, workers should be prepared to join in cooperative efforts to increase productivity, flexibility and quality. Government's neutrality between labor and management cannot mean neutrality about the collective bargaining process, which has been purposely crippled by Republican administrations. Our economic growth depends on processes, including collective bargaining, that permit labor and management to work together on their common interests, even as they work out their conflicts. Responsibility for the Environment. For ourselves and future generations, we must protect our environment. We will protect our old growth forests, preserve critical habitats, provide a genuine ""no net loss"" policy on wetlands, reduce our dependence on toxic chemicals, conserve the critical resources of soil, water and air, oppose new offshore oil drilling and mineral exploration and production in our nation's many environmentally critical areas, and address ocean pollution by reducing oil and toxic waste spills at sea. We believe America's youth can serve its country well through a civilian conservation corps. To protect the public health, we will clean up the environmental horrors at federal facilities, insist that private polluters clean up their toxic and hazardous wastes, and vigorously prosecute environmental criminals. We will oppose Republican efforts to gut the Clean Air Act in the guise of competitiveness. We will reduce the volume of solid waste and encourage the use of recycled materials while discouraging excess packaging. To avoid the mistakes of the past, we will actively support energy- efficiency, recycling, and pollution prevention strategies. Responsible Government. Democrats in 1992 intend to lead a revolution in government, challenging it to act responsibly and be accountable, starting with the hardest and most urgent problems of the deficit and economic growth. Rather than throw money at obsolete programs, we will eliminate unnecessary layers of management, cut administrative costs, give people more choices in the service they get, and empower them to make those choices. To foster greater responsibility in government at every level, we support giving greater flexibility to our cities, counties and states in achieving Federal mandates and carrying out existing programs. Responsible Officials. All branches of government must live by the laws the rest of us obey, determine their pay in an open manner that builds public trust, and eliminate special privileges. People in public office need to be accessible to the people they represent. It's time to reform the campaign finance system, to get big money out of our politics and let the people back in. We must limit overall campaign spending and limit the disproportionate and excessive role of PACs. We need new voter registration laws that expand the electorate, such as universal same-day registration, along with full political rights and protections for public employees and new regulations to ensure that the airwaves truly help citizens make informed choices among candidates and policies. And we need fair political representation for all sectors of our country - including the District of Columbia, which deserves and must get statehood status. III. RESTORING COMMUNITY The success of democracy in America depends substantially on the strength of our community institutions: families and neighborhoods, public schools, religious institutions, charitable organizations, civic groups and other voluntary associations. In these social networks, the values and character of our citizens are formed, as we learn the habits and skills of self government, and acquire an understanding of our common rights and responsibilities as citizens. Twelve years of Republican rule have undermined the spirit of mutual dependence and obligation that binds us together. Republican leaders have urged Americans to turn inward, to pursue private interests without regard to public responsibilities. By playing racial, ethnic and gender-based politics they have divided us against each other, created an atmosphere of blame, denial and fear, and undone the hard-fought battles for equality and fairness. Our communities form a vital ""third sector"" that lies between government and the marke place. The wisdom, energy and resources required to solve our problems are not concentrated in Washington, but can be found throughout our communities, including America's non-profit sector, which has grown rapidly over the last decade. Government's best role is to enable people and communities to solve their own problems. America's special genius has been to forge a community of shared values from people of remarkable and diverse backgrounds. As the party of inclusion, we take special pride in our country's emergence as the world's largest and most successful multiethnic, multiracial republic. We condemn antisemitism, racism, homophobia, bigotry and negative stereotyping of all kinds. We must help all Americans understand the diversity of our cultural heritage. But it is also essential that we preserve and pass on to our children the common elements that hold this mosaic together as we work to make our country a land of freedom and opportunity for all. Both Republican neglect and traditional spending programs have proven unequal to these challenges. Democrats will pursue a new course that stresses work, family and individual responsibility, and that empowers Americans to liberate themselves from poverty and dependence. We pledge to bolster the institutions of civil society and place a new emphasis on civic enterprises that seek solutions to our nation's problems. Through common, cooperative efforts we can rebuild our communities and transform our nation. Combatting Crime and Drugs. Crime is a relentless danger to our communities. Over the last decade, crime has swept through our country at an alarming rate. During the 1980s, more than 200,000 Americans were murdered, four times the number who died in Vietnam. Violent crimes rose by more than 16 percent since 1988 and nearly doubled since 1975. In our country today, a murder is committed every 25 minutes, a rape every six minutes, a burglary every 10 seconds. The pervasive fear of crime disfigures our public life and diminishes our freedom. None suffer more than the poor: an explosive mixture of blighted prospects, drugs and exotic weaponry has turned many of our inner city communities into combat zones. As a result, crime is not only a symptom but also a major cause of the worsening poverty and demoralization that afflicts inner city communities. To empower America's communities, Democrats pledge to restore government as the upholder of basic law and order for crime-ravaged communities. The simplest and most direct way to restore order in our cities is to put more police on the streets. America's police are locked in an unequal struggle with crime: since 1951 the ratio of police officers to reported crimes has reversed, from three-to-one to one-to-three. We will create a Police Corps, in which participants would receive college aid in return for several years of service after graduation in a state or local police department. As we shift people and resources from defense to the civilian economy, we will create new jobs in law enforcement for those leaving the military. We will expand drug counselling and treatment for those who need it, intensify efforts to educate our children at the earliest ages to the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse, and curb demand from the street corner to the penthouse suite, so that the U.S., with five percent of the world's population, no longer consumes 50 percent of the world's illegal drugs. Community Policing. Neighborhoods and police should be partners in the war on crime. Democrats support more community policing, which uses foot patrols and storefront offices to make police officers visible fixtures in urban neighborhoods. We will combat street violence and emphasize building trust and solving the problems that breed crime. Firearms. It is time to shut down the weapons bazaars in our cities. We support a reason ble waiting period to permit background checks for purchases of handguns, as well as assault weapons controls to ban the possession, sale, importation and manufacture of the most deadly assault weapons. We do not support efforts to restrict weapons used for legitimate hunting and sporting purposes. We will work for swift and certain punishment of all people who violate the country's gun laws and for stronger sentences for criminals who use guns. We will also seek to shut down the black market for guns and impose severe penalties on people who sell guns to children. Pursuing All Crime Aggressively. In contrast to the Republican policy of leniency toward white collar crime -- which breeds cynicism in poor communities about the impartiality of our justice system -- Democrats will redouble efforts to ferret out and punish those who betray the public trust, rig financial markets, misuse their depositors' money or swindle their customers. Further Initiatives. Democrats also favor innovative sentencing and punishment options, including community service and boot camps for first time offenders; tougher penalties for rapists; victim-impact statements and restitution to ensure that crime victims will not be lost in the complexities of the criminal justice system; and initiatives to make our schools safe, including alternative schools for disruptive children. Empowering The Poor and Expanding The Middle Class. We must further the new direction set in the Family Support Act of 1988, away from subsistence and dependence and toward work, family and personal initiative and responsibility. We advocate slower phasing out of Medicaid and other benefits to encourage work; special savings accounts to help low-income families build assets; fair lending; an indexed minimum wage; an expanded Job Corps; and an end to welfare rules that encourage family breakup and penalize individual initiative, such as the $1,000 limit on personal savings. Immigration. Our nation of immigrants has been invigorated repeatedly as new people, ideas and ways of life have become part of the American tapestry. Democrats support immigration policies that promote fairness, non- discrimination and family reunification, and that reflect our constitutional freedoms of speech, association and travel. Housing. Safe, secure housing is essential to the institutions of community and family. We support homeownership for working families and will honor that commitment through policies that encourage affordable mortgage credit. We must also confront homelessness by renovating, preserving and expanding the stock of affordable low-income housing. We support tenant management and ownership, so public housing residents can manage their own affairs and acquire property worth protecting. National Service. We will create new opportunities for citizens to serve each other, their communities and their country. By mobilizing hundreds of thousands of volunteers, national service will enhance the role of ordinary citizens in solving unresolved community problems. The Arts. We believe in public support for the Arts, including a National Endowment for the Arts that is free from political manipulation and firmly rooted in the First Amendment's freedom of expression guarantee. IV.PRESERVING OUR NATIONAL SECURITY During the past four years, we have seen the corrosive effect of foreign policies that are rooted in the past, divorced from our values, fearful of change and unable to meet its challenges. Under President Bush, crises have been managed, rather than prevented; dictators like Saddam Hussein have been wooed, rather than deterred; aggression by the Serbian regime against its neighbors in what was Yugoslavia has been met by American timidity r ther than toughness; human rights abusers have been rewarded, not challenged; the environment has been neglected, not protected; and America's competitive edge in the global economy has been dulled, not honed. It is time for new American leadership that can meet the challenges of a changing world. At the end of World War II, American strength had defeated tyranny and American ingenuity had overcome the Depression. Under President Truman, the United States led the world into a new era, redefining global security with bold approaches to tough challenges: containing communism with the NATO alliance and in Korea; building the peace through organizations such as the United Nations; and advancing global economic security through new multilateral institutions. Nearly a half century later, we stand at another pivotal point in history. The collapse of communism does not mean the end of danger or threats to our interests. But it does pose an unprecedented opportunity to make our future more secure and prosperous. Once again, we must define a compelling vision for global leadership at the dawn of a new era. Restructuring Our Military Forces. We have not seen the end of violence, aggression and the conflicts that can threaten American interests and our hopes for a more peaceful world. What the United States needs is not the Bush Administration's Cold War thinking on a smaller scale, but a comprehensive restructuring of the American military enterprise to meet the threats that remain. Military Strength. America is the world's strongest military power and we must remain so. A post-Cold War restructuring of American forces will produce substantial savings beyond those promised by the Bush Administration, but that restructuring must be achieved without undermining our ability to meet future threats to our security. A military structure for the 1990's and beyond must be built on four pillars: First, a survivable nuclear force to deter any conceivable threat, as we reduce our nuclear arsenals through arms control negotiations and other reciprocal action. Second, conventional forces shifted toward projecting power wherever our vital national interests are threatened. This means reducing the size of our forces in Europe, while meeting our obligations to NATO, and strengthening our rapid deployment capabilities to deal with new threats to our security posed by renegade dictators, terrorists, international drug traffickers, and the local armed conflicts that can threaten the peace of entire regions. Third, maintenance of the two qualities that make America's military the best in the world -- the superiority of our military personnel and of our technology. These qualities are vital to shortening any conflict and saving American lives. Fourth, intelligence capabilities redirected to develop far more sophisticated, timely and accurate analyses of the economic and political conditions that can fuel new conflicts. Use Of Force. The United States must be prepared to use military force decisively when necessary to defend our vital interests. The burdens of collective security in a new era must be shared fairly, and we should encourage multilateral peacekeeping through the United Nations and other international efforts. Preventing And Containing Conflict. American policy must be focused on averting military threats as well as meeting them. To halt the spread of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, we must lead a renewed international effort to get tough with companies that peddle nuclear and chemical warfare technologies, strengthen the International Atomic Energy Agency, and enforce strong sanctions against governments that violate international restraints. A Comprehensive Test Ban would strengthen our ability to stop the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries, which may be our greatest future security threat. We must press for strong international limits on the dangerous and wasteful flow of conventional arms to troubled regions. A U.S. troop presence should be maintained in South K rea as long as North Korea presents a threat to South Korea. Restoring America's Economic Leadership The United States cannot be strong abroad if it is weak at home. Restoring America's global economic leadership must become a central element of our national security policies. The strength of nations, once defined in military terms, now is measured also by the skills of their workers, the imagination of their managers and the power of their technologies. Either we develop and pursue a national plan for restoring our economy through a partnership of government, labor and business, or we slip behind the nations that are competing with us and growing. At stake are American jobs, our standard of living and the quality of life for ourselves and our children. Economic strength -- indeed our national security -- is grounded on a healthy domestic economy. But we cannot be strong at home unless we are part of a vibrant and expanding global economy that recognizes human rights and seeks to improve the living standards of all the world's people. This is vital to achieving good quality, high paying jobs for Americans. Trade. Our government must work to expand trade, while insisting that the conduct of world trade is fair. It must fight to uphold American interests -- promoting exports, expanding trade in agricultural and other products, opening markets in major product and service sectors with our principal competitors, and achieving reciprocal access. This should include renewed authority to use America's trading leverage against the most serious problems. The U.S. government also must firmly enforce U.S. laws against unfair trade. Trade Agreements. Multilateral trade agreements can advance our economic interests by expanding the global economy. Whether negotiating the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) or completing the GATT negotiations, our government must assure that our legitimate concerns about environmental, health and safety, and labor standards are included. Those American workers whose jobs are affected must have the benefit of effective adjustment assistance. Promoting Democracy Brave men and women -- like the hero who stood in front of a tank in Beijing and the leader who stood on a tank in Moscow - are putting their lives on the line for democracy around the world. But as the tide of democracy rose in the former Soviet Union and in China, in the Baltics and South Africa, only reluctantly did this Administration abandon the status quo and embrace the fight for freedom. Support for democracy serves our ideals and our interests. A more democratic world is a world that is more peaceful and more stable. An American foreign policy of engagement for democracy must effectively address: Emerging Democracies. Helping to lead an international effort to assist the emerging - and still fragile - democracies in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union build democratic institutions in free market settings, demilitarize their societies and integrate their econ mies into the world trading system. Unlike the Bush Administration, which waited too long to recognize the new democratic governments in the Baltic countries and the nations of the former Soviet Union, we must act decisively with our European allies to support freedom, diminish ethnic tensions, and oppose aggression in the former communist countries, such as Bosnia-Herzegovina, which are struggling to make the transition from communism to democracy. As change sweeps through the Balkans, the United States must be sensitive to the concerns of Greece regarding the use of the name Macedonia. And in the post-Cold War era, our foreign assistance programs in Africa, the Caribbean, Latin America and elsewhere should be targeted at helping democracies rather than tyrants. Democracy Corps. Promoting democratic institutions by creating a Democracy Corps to send American volunteers to countries that seek legal, financial and political expertise to build democratic institutions, and support groups like the National Endowment for Democracy, the Asia Foundation, and others. China Trade Terms. Conditioning of favorable trade terms for China on respect for human rights in China and Tibet, greater market access for U.S. goods, and responsible conduct on weapons proliferation. South Africa. Maintenance of state and local sanctions against South Africa in support of an investment code of conduct, existing limits on deductibility of taxes paid to South Africa, and diplomatic pressure until there is an irreversible, full and fair accommodation with the black majority to create a democratic government with full rights for all its citizens. We deplore the continuing violence, especially in Boipatong Township, and are concerned about the collapse of the negotiations. The U.S. Government should consider reimposing Federal sanctions. The Democratic Party supports the creation of a South African/American Enterprise Fund that will provide a new interim government with public and private funds to assist in the development of democracy in South Africa. Middle East Peace. Support for the peace process now underway in the Middle East, rooted in the tradition of the Camp David accords. Direct negotiations between Israel, her Arab neighbors and Palestinians, with no imposed solutions, are the only way to achieve enduring security for Israel and full peace for all parties in the region. The end of the Cold War does not alter America's deep interest in our longstanding special relationship with Israel, based on shared values, a mutual commitment to democracy, and a strategic alliance that benefits both nations. The United States must act effectively as an honest broker in the peace process. It must not, as has been the case with this Administration, encourage one side to believe that it will deliver unilateral concessions from the other. Jerusalem is the capital of the state of Israel and should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths. Human Rights. Standing everywhere for the rights of individuals and respect for ethnic minorities against the repressive acts of governments - against torture, political imprisonment, and all attacks on civilized standards of human freedom. This is a proud tradition of the Democratic Party, which has stood for freedom in South Africa and continues to resist oppression in Cuba. Our nation should once again promote the principle of sanctuary for politically oppressed people everywhere, be they Haitian refugees, Soviet Jews seeking U.S. help in their successful absorption into Israeli society, or Vietnamese fleeing communism. Forcible return of anyone fleeing political repression is a betrayal of American values. Human Needs. Support for the struggle against poverty and disease in the developing world, including the heartbreaking famine in Africa. We must not replace the East-West conflict with one between North and South, a growing divide between the industrialized and developing world. Our development programs must be reexamined and restructured to assure that their benefits truly help those most in need to help themselves. At stake are the lives of millions of human beings who live in hunger, uprooted from their homes, too often without hope. The United States should work to establish a specific plan and timetable for the elimination of world hunger. Cyprus. A renewed commitment to achieve a Cyprus settlement pursuant to the United Nations resolutions. This goal must now be restored to the diplomatic agenda of the United States. Northern Ireland. In light of America's historic ties to the people of Great Britain and Ireland, and consistent with our country's commitment to peace, democracy and human rights around the world, a more active United States role in promoting peace and political dialogue to bring an end to the violence and achieve a negotiated solution in Northern Ireland. Preserving The Global Environment As the threat of nuclear holocaust recedes, the future of the earth is challenged by gathering environmental crises. As governments around the world have sought the path to concerted action, the Bush Administration -- despite its alleged foreign policy expertise -- has been more of an obstacle to progress than a leader for change, practicing isolationism on an issue that affects us all. Democrats know we must act now to save the health of the earth, and the health of our children, for generations to come. Addressing Global Warming. The United States must become a leader, not an impediment, in the fight against global warming. We should join our European allies in agreeing to limit carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Ozone Depletion. The United States must be a world leader in finding replacements for CFCs and other ozone depleting substances. Biodiversity We must work actively to protect the planet's biodiversity and preserve its forests. At the Rio Earth Summit, the Bush Administration's failure to negotiate a biodiversity treaty it could sign was an abdication of international leadership. Developing Nations. We must fashion imaginative ways of engaging governments and business in the effort to encourage developing nations to preserve their environmental heritage. Population Growth. Explosive population growth must be controlled by working closely with other industrialized and developing nations and private organizations to fund greater family planning efforts. As a nation and as a people, we have entered into a new era. The Republican President and his advisors are rooted in Cold War precepts and cannot think or act anew. Through almost a half century of sacrifice, constancy and strength, the American people advanced democracy's triumph in the Cold War. Only new leadership that restores our nation's greatness at home can successfully draw upon these same strengths of the American people to lead the world into a new era of peace and freedom. In recent years we have seen brave people abroad face down tanks, defy coups, and risk exodus by boat on the high seas for a chance at freedom and the kind of opportunities we call the American Dream. It is time for Americans to fight against the decline of those same opportunities here at home. Americans know that, in the end, we will all rise or fall together. To make our society one again, Democrats will restore America's founding values of family, community and common purpose. We believe in the American people. We will challenge all Americans to give something back to their country. And they will be enriched in return, for when individuals assume responsibility, they acquire dignity. When people go to work, they rediscover a pride that was lost. When absent parents pay child support, they restore a connection they and their children need. When students work harder, they discover they can learn as well as any on earth. When corporate managers put their workers and long-term success ahead of short-term gain, their companies do well and so do they. When the leaders we elect assume responsibility for America's problems, we will do what is right to move America forward together.",54845,8597,"a new covenant with the american people two hundred summers ago, this democratic party was founded by the man whose burning pen fired the spirit of the american revolution - who once argued we should overthrow our own government every years to renew our freedom and keep pace with a changing world. in , the party thomas jefferson founded invokes his spirit of revolution anew. our land reverberates with a battle cry of frustration that emanates from america's very soul - from the families in our bedrock neighborhoods, from the unsung, workaday heroes of the world's greatest democracy and economy. america is on the wrong track. the american people are hurting. the american dream of expanding opportunity has faded. middle class families are working hard, playing by the rules, but still falling behind. poverty has exploded. our people are torn by divisions. the last years have been a nightmare of republican irresponsibility and neglect. america's leadership is indifferent at home and uncertain in the world. republican mismanagement has disarmed government as an instrument to make our economy work and support the people's most basic values, needs and hopes. the republicans brought america a false and fragile prosperity based on borrowing, not income, and so will leave behind a mountain of public debt and a backbreaking annual burden in interest. it is wrong to borrow to spend on ourselves, leaving our children to pay our debts. we hear the anguish and the anger of the american people. we know it is directed not just at the republican administrations that have had power, but at government itself. their anger is justified. we can no longer afford business as usual -- neither the policies of the last years of tax breaks for the rich, mismanagement, lack of leadership and cuts in services for the middle class and the poor, nor the adoption of new programs and new spending without new thinking. it is time to listen to the grassroots of america, time to renew the spirit of citizen activism that has always been the touchstone of a free and democratic society. therefore we call for a revolution in government - to take power away from entrenched bureaucracies and narrow interests in washington and put it back in the hands of ordinary people. we vow to make government more decentralized, more flexible, and more accountable - to reform public institutions and replace public officials who aren't leading with ones who will. the revolution of is about restoring america's economic greatness. we need to rebuild america by abandoning the something-for-nothing ethic of the last decade and putting people first for a change. only a thriving economy, a strong manufacturing base, and growth in creative new enterprise can generate the resources to meet the nation's pressing human and social needs. an expanding, entrepreneurial economy of high-skill, high-wage jobs is the most important family policy, urban policy, labor policy, minority policy and foreign policy america can have. the revolution of is about putting government back on the side of working men and women - to help those who work hard, pay their bills, play by the rules, don't lobby for tax breaks, do their best to give their kids a good education and to keep them away from drugs, who want a safe neighborhood for their families, the security of decent, productive jobs for themselves, and a dignified life for their parents. the revolution of is about a radical change in the way government operates - not the republican proposition that government has no role, nor the old notion that there's a program for every problem, but a shift to a more efficient, flexible and results-oriented government that improves services, expands choices, and empowers citizens and communities to change our country from the bottom up. we believe in an activist government, but it must work in a different, more responsive way. the revolution of is about facing up to tough choices. there is no relief for america's frustration in the politics of diversion and evasion, of false choices or of no choices at all. instead of everyone in washington blaming one another for inaction, we will act decisively -- and ask to be held accountable if we don't. above all the revolution of is about restoring the basic american values that built this country and will always make it great: personal responsibility, individual liberty, tolerance, faith, family and hard work. we offer the american people not only new ideas, a new course, and a new president, but a return to the enduring principles that set our nation apart: the promise of opportunity, the strength of community, the dignity of work, and a decent life for senior citizens. to make this revolution, we seek a new covenant to repair the damaged bond between the american people and their government, that will expand opportunity, insist upon greater individual responsibility in return, restore community, and ensure national security in a profoundly new era. we welcome the close scrutiny of the american people, including americans who may have thought the democratic party had forgotten its way, as well as all who know us as the champions of those who have been denied a chance. with this platform we take our case for change to the american people. i. opportunity our party's first priority is opportunity -- broad- based, non-inflationary economic growth and the opportunity that flows from it. democrats in hold nothing more important for america than an economy that offers growth and jobs for all. president bush, with no interest in domestic policy, has given america the slowest economic growth, the slowest income growth, and the slowest jobs growth since the great depression. and the american people know the long bush recession reflects not just a business cycle, but a long-term slide, so that even in a fragile recovery we're sinking. the ballooning bush deficits hijacked capital from productive investments. savings and loan sharks enriched themselves at their country's expense. the stock market tripled, but average incomes stalled, and poverty claimed more of our children. we reject both the do-nothing government of the last twelve years and the big government theory that says we can hamstring business and tax and spend our way to prosperity. instead we offer a third way. just as we have always viewed working men and women as the bedrock of our economy, we honor business as a noble endeavor, and vow to create a far better climate for firms and independent contractors of all sizes that empower their workers, revolutionize their workplaces, respect the environment, and serve their communities well. we believe in free enterprise and the power of market forces. but economic growth will not come without a national economic strategy to invest in people. for twelve years our country has had no economic vision, leadership or strategy. it is time to put our people and our country first. investing in america. the only way to lay the foundation for renewed american prosperity is to spur both public and private investment. we must strive to close both the budget deficit and the investment gap. our major competitors invest far more than we do in roads, bridges, and the information networks and technologies of the future. we will rebuild america by investing more in transportation, environmental technologies, defense conversion, and a national information network. to begin making our economy grow, the president and congress should agree that savings from defense must be reinvested productively at home, including research, education and training, and other productive investments. this will sharply increase the meager nine percent of the national budget now devoted to the future. we will create a ""future budget"" for investments that make us richer, to be kept separate from those parts of the budget that pay for the past and present. for the private sector, instead of a sweeping capital gains windfall to the wealthy and those who speculate, we will create an investment tax credit and a capital gains reduction for patient investors in emerging technologies and new businesses. support for innovation. we will take back the advantage now ceded to japan and germany, which invest in new technologies at higher rates than the u. s. and have the growth to show for it. we will make the r&;d tax credit permanent, double basic research in the key technologies for our future, and create a civilian research agency to fast-forward their development. the deficit. addressing the deficit requires fair and shared sacrifice of all americans for the common good. in republican years a national debt that took years to accumulate has been quadrupled. rising interest on that debt now swallows one tax dollar in seven. in place of the republican supply-side disaster, the democratic investment, economic conversion and growth strategy will generate more revenues from a growing economy. we must also tackle spending, by putting everything on the table; eliminate nonproductive programs; achieve defense savings; reform entitlement programs to control soaring health care costs; cut federal administrative costs by percent annually for four years; limit increases in the ""present budget"" to the rate of growth in the average american's paycheck; apply a strict ""pay as you go"" rule to new non-investment spending; and make the rich pay their fair share in taxes. these choices will be made while protecting senior citizens and without further victimizing the poor. this deficit reduction effort will encourage private savings, eliminate the budget deficit over time, and permit fiscal policies that can restore america's economic health. defense conversion. our economy needs both the people and the funds released from defense at the cold war's end. we will help the stalwarts of that struggle -- the men and women who served in our armed forces and who work in our defense industries – make the most of a new era. we will provide early notice of program changes to give commun ties, businesses and workers enough time to plan. we will honor and support our veterans. departing military personnel, defense workers, and defense support personnel will have access to job retraining, continuing education, placement and relocation assistance, early retirement benefits for military personnel, and incentives to enter teaching, law enforcement and other vital civilian fields. redirected national laboratories and a new civilian research agency will put defense scientists, engineers and technicians to work in critical civilian technologies. small business defense firms will have technical assistance and transition grants and loans to help convert to civilian markets, and defense dependent communities will have similar aid in planning and implementing conversion. we will strongly support our civilian space program, particularly environmental missions. the cities. only a robust economy will revitalize our cities. it is in all americans' interest that the cities once again be places where hard-working families can put down roots and find good jobs, quality health care, affordable housing, and decent schools. democrats will create a new partnership to rebuild america's cities after years of republican neglect. this partnership with the mayors will include consideration of the seven economic growth initiatives set forth by our nation's mayors. we will create jobs by investing significant resources to put people back to work, beginning with a summer jobs initiative and training programs for inner-city youth. we support a stronger community development program and targeted fiscal assistance to cities that need it most. a national public works investment and infrastructure program will provide jobs and strengthen our cities, suburbs, rural communities and country. we will encourage the flow of investment to inner city development and housing through targeted enterprise zones and incentives for private and public pension funds to invest in urban and rural projects. while cracking down on redlining and housing discrimination, we also support and will enforce a revitalized community reinvestment act that challenges banks to lend to entrepreneurs and development projects; a national network of community development banks to invest in urban and rural small businesses; and microenterprise lending for poor people seeking self-employment as an alternative to we fare. agriculture and the rural community. all americans, producers and consumers alike, benefit when our food and fiber are produced by hundreds of thousands of family farmers r ceiving fair prices for their products. the abundance of our nation's food and fiber system should not be taken for granted. the revolution that lifted america to the forefront of world agriculture was achieved through a unique partnership of public and private interests. the inattention and hostility that has characterized republican food, agricultural and rural development policies of the past twelve years have caused a crisis in rural america. the cost of republican farm policy has been staggering and its total failure is demonstrated by the record number of rural bankruptcies. a sufficient and sustainable agricultural economy can be achieved through fiscally responsible programs. it is time to reestablish the private/public partnership to ensure that family farmers get a fair return for their labor and investment, so that consumers receive safe and nutritious foods, and that needed investments are made in basic research, education, rural business development, market development and infrastructure to sustain rural communities. workers' rights. our workplaces must be revolutionized to make them more flexible and productive. we will reform the job safety laws to empower workers with greater rights and to hold employers accountable for dangers on the job. we will act against sexual ha assment in the workplace. we will honor the work ethic -- by expanding the earned income tax credit so no one with children at home who works full-time is still in poverty; by fighting on the side of family farmers to ensure they get a fair price for their hard work; by working to sustain rural communities; by making work more valuable than welfare; and by supporting the right of workers to organize and bargain collectively without fear of intimidation or permanent replacement during labor disputes. lifelong learning. a competitive american economy requires the global market's best educated, best trained, most flexible workforce. it's not enough to spend more on our schools; we must insist on results. we oppose the bush administration's efforts to bankrupt the public school system - the bedrock of democracy - through private school vouchers. to help children reach school ready to learn, we will expand child health and nutrition programs and extend head start to all eligible children, and guarantee all children access to quality, affordable child care. we deplore the savage inequalities among public schools across the land, and believe every child deserves an equal chance to a world class education. reallocating resources toward this goal must be a priority. we support education reforms such as site-based decision-making and public school choice, with strong protections against discrimination. we support the goal of a percent graduation rate, and programs to end dropouts. we will invest in educational technology, and establish world-class standards in math, science and other core subjects and support effective tests of progress to meet them. in areas where there are no registered apprenticeship programs, we will adopt a national apprenticeship-style program to ease the transition from school to work for non-college bound students so they can acquire skills that lead to high-wage jobs. in the new economy, opportunity will depend on lifelong learning. we will support the goal of literacy for all americans. we will ask firms to invest in the training of all workers, not just corporate management. a domestic gi bill. over the past twelve years skyrocketing costs and declining middle class incomes have placed higher education out of reach for millions of americans. it is time to revolutionize the way student loan programs are run. we will make college affordable to all students who are qualified to attend, regardless of family income. a domestic g.i bill will enable all americans to borrow money for college, so long as they are willing to pay it back as a percentage of their income over time or through national service addressing u met community needs. affordable health care. all americans should have universal access to quality, affordable health care -- not as a privilege, but as a right. that requires tough controls on health costs, which are rising at two to three times the rate of inflation, terrorizing american families and businesses and depriving millions of the care they need. we will enact a uniquely american reform of the health care system to control costs and make health care affordable; ensure quality and choice of health care providers; cover all americans regardless of preexisting conditions; squeeze out waste, bureaucracy and abuse; improve primary and preventive care including child immunization and prevention of diseases like tuberculosis now becoming rampant in our cities; provide expanded education on the relationship between diet and health; expand access to mental health treatment services; provide a safety net through support of public hospitals; provide for the full range of reproductive choice -- education, counseling, access to contraceptives, and the right to a safe, legal abortion; expand medical research; and provide more long term care, including home health care. we will make ending the epidemic in breast cancer a major priority, and expand research on breast, cervical and ovarian cancer, infertility, reproductive health services and other special health needs of women. we must be united in declaring war on aids and hiv disease, implement the recommendations of the national commission on aids and fully fund the ryan white care act; provide targeted and honest prevention campaigns; combat hiv-related discrimination; make drug treatment available for all addicts who seek it; guarantee access to quality care; expand clinical trials for treatments and vaccines; and speed up the fda drug approval process. fairness. growth and equity work in tandem. people should share in society's common costs according to their ability to pay. in the last decade, mounting payroll and other taxes have fallen disproportionately on the middle class. we will relieve the tax burden on middle class americans by forcing the rich to pay their fair share. we will provide long-overdue tax relief to families with children. to broaden opportunity, we will support fair lending practices. energy efficiency and sustainable development. we reject the republican myth that energy efficiency and environmental protection are enemies of economic growth. we will make our economy more efficient, by using less energy, reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and producing less solid and toxic waste. we will adopt a coordinated transportation policy, with a strong commitment to mass transit; encourage efficient alternative-fueled vehicles; increase our reliance on clean natural gas; promote clean coal technology; invest in r&;d on renewable energy sources; strengthen efforts to prevent air and water pollution; support incentives for domestic oil and gas operations; and push for revenue-neutral incentives that reward conservation, prevent pollution and encourage recycling. civil and equal rights. we don't have an american to waste. democrats will continue to lead the fight to ensure that no americans suffer discrimination or deprivation of rights on the basis of race, gender, language, national origin, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, or other characteristics irrelevant to ability. we support the ratification of the equal rights amendment; affirmative action; stronger protection of voting rights for racial and ethnic minorities, including language access to voting; and continued resistance to discriminatory english-only pressure groups. we will reverse the bush administration's assault on civil rights enforcement, and instead work to rebuild and vigorously use machinery for civil rights enforcement; support comparable remedies for women; aggressively prosecute hate crimes; strengthen legal services for the poor; deal with other nations in such a way that americans of any origin do not become scapegoats or victims of foreign policy disputes; provide civil rights protection for gay men and lesbians and an end to defense department discrimination; respect native american culture and our treaty commitments; require the united states government to recognize its trustee obligations to the inhabitants of hawaii generally, and to native hawaiians in particular; and fully enforce the americans with dis bility act to enable people with disabilities to achieve independence and function at their highest possible level. commonwealths and territories. we recognize the existing status of the commonwealth of puerto rico and the strong economic relationship between the people of puerto rico and the united states. we pledge to support the right of the people of the commonwealth of puerto rico to choose freely, and in concert with the u.s. congress, their relationship with the united states, either as an enhanced commonwealth, a state or an independent nation. we support fair participation for puerto rico in federal programs. we pledge to the people of american samoa, guam, the northern mariana islands, and the virgin islands just and fair treatment under federal policies, assisting their economic and social development. we respect their right and that of the people of palau to decide freely their future relationship with the united states and to be consulted on issues and policies that directly affect them. ii.responsibility sixty years ago, franklin roosevelt gave hope to a nation mired in the great depression. while government should promise every american the opportunity to get ahead, it was the people's responsibility, he said, to make the most of that opportunity: ""faith in america demands that we recognize the new terms of the old social contract. in the strength of great hope we must all shoulder our common load. for twelve years, the republicans have expected too little of our public institutions and placed too little faith in our people. we offer a new social contract based neither on callous, do-nothing republican neglect, nor on an outdated faith in programs as the solution to every problem. we favor a third way beyond the old approaches -- to put government back on the side of citizens who play by the rules. we believe that by what it says and how it conducts its business, government must once again make responsibility an instrument of national purpose. our future as a nation depends upon the daily assumption of personal responsibility by millions of americans from all walks of life - for the religious faiths they follow, the ethics they practice, the values they instill, and the pride they take in their work. strengthening the family. governments don't raise children, people do. people who bring children into this world have a responsibility to care for them and give them values, motivation and discipline. children should not have children. we need a national crackdown on deadbeat parents, an effective system of child support enforcement nationwide, and a systematic effort to establish paternity for every child. we must also make it easier for parents to build strong families through pay equity. family and medical leave will ensure that workers don't have to choose between family and work. we support a family preservation program to reduce child and spousal abuse by providing preventive services and foster care to families in crisis. we favor ensuring quality and affordable child care opportunities for working parents, and a fair and healthy start for every child, including essential pre-natal and well baby care. we support the needs of our senior citizens for productive and healthy lives, including hunger prevention, income adequacy, transportation access and abuse prevention. welfare reform. welfare should be a second chance, not a way of life. we want to break the cycle of welfare by adhering to two simple principles: no one who is able to work can stay on welfare forever, and no one who works should live in poverty. we will continue to help those who cannot help themselves. we will offer people on welfare a new social contract. we'll invest in education and job training, and provide the child care and health care they need to go to work and achieve long-term self- sufficiency. we will give them the help they need to make the transition from welfare to work, and require people who can work to go to work within two years in available jobs either in the private sector or in community service to meet unmet needs. this will restore the covenant that welfare was meant to be: a promise of temporary help for people who have fallen on hard times. choice. democrats stand behind the right of every woman to choose, consistent with roe v.wade, regardless of ability to pay, and support a national law to protect that right. it is a fundamental constitutional liberty that individual americans - not government - can best take responsibility for making the most difficult and intensely personal decisions regarding reproduction. the goal of our nation must be to make abortion less necessary, not more difficult or more dangerous. we pledge to support contraceptive research, family planning, comprehensive family life education, and policies that support healthy childbearing and enable parents to care most effectively for their children. making schools work. education is a cooperative enterprise that can only succeed if everyone accepts and exercises personal responsibility. students must stay in school and do their best; parents must get involved in their children's education; teachers must attain, maintain, and demonstrate classroom competency; school administrators must enforce discipline and high standards of educational attainment; governments must end the inequalities that create educational ghettos among school districts and provide equal educational opportunity for all; and ensure that teachers' pay measures up to their decisive role in children's lives; and the american people should recognize education as the core of our economy, democracy and society. labor-management responsibilities. the private sector is the engine of our economy and the main source of national wealth. but it is not enough for those in the private sector just to make as much money as they can. the most irresponsible people in all of the 1980s were those at the top of the ladder: the inside traders, quick buck artists, and s&;l kingpins who looked out for themselves and not for the country. america's corporate leaders have a responsibility to invest in their country. ceos, who pay themselves times what they pay the average worker, shouldn't get big raises unrelated to performance. if a company wants to overpay its executives and underinvest in the future or transfer jobs overseas, it shouldn't get special treatment and tax breaks from the treasury. managers must work with employees to make the workplace safer, more satisfying and more efficient. workers must also accept added responsibilities in the new economy. in return for an i creased voice and a greater stake in the success of their enterprises, workers should be prepared to join in cooperative efforts to increase productivity, flexibility and quality. government's neutrality between labor and management cannot mean neutrality about the collective bargaining process, which has been purposely crippled by republican administrations. our economic growth depends on processes, including collective bargaining, that permit labor and management to work together on their common interests, even as they work out their conflicts. responsibility for the environment. for ourselves and future generations, we must protect our environment. we will protect our old growth forests, preserve critical habitats, provide a genuine ""no net loss"" policy on wetlands, reduce our dependence on toxic chemicals, conserve the critical resources of soil, water and air, oppose new offshore oil drilling and mineral exploration and production in our nation's many environmentally critical areas, and address ocean pollution by reducing oil and toxic waste spills at sea. we believe america's youth can serve its country well through a civilian conservation corps. to protect the public health, we will clean up the environmental horrors at federal facilities, insist that private polluters clean up their toxic and hazardous wastes, and vigorously prosecute environmental criminals. we will oppose republican efforts to gut the clean air act in the guise of competitiveness. we will reduce the volume of solid waste and encourage the use of recycled materials while discouraging excess packaging. to avoid the mistakes of the past, we will actively support energy- efficiency, recycling, and pollution prevention strategies. responsible government. democrats in intend to lead a revolution in government, challenging it to act responsibly and be accountable, starting with the hardest and most urgent problems of the deficit and economic growth. rather than throw money at obsolete programs, we will eliminate unnecessary layers of management, cut administrative costs, give people more choices in the service they get, and empower them to make those choices. to foster greater responsibility in government at every level, we support giving greater flexibility to our cities, counties and states in achieving federal mandates and carrying out existing programs. responsible officials. all branches of government must live by the laws the rest of us obey, determine their pay in an open manner that builds public trust, and eliminate special privileges. people in public office need to be accessible to the people they represent. it's time to reform the campaign finance system, to get big money out of our politics and let the people back in. we must limit overall campaign spending and limit the disproportionate and excessive role of pacs. we need new voter registration laws that expand the electorate, such as universal same-day registration, along with full political rights and protections for public employees and new regulations to ensure that the airwaves truly help citizens make informed choices among candidates and policies. and we need fair political representation for all sectors of our country - including the district of columbia, which deserves and must get statehood status. iii. restoring community the success of democracy in america depends substantially on the strength of our community institutions: families and neighborhoods, public schools, religious institutions, charitable organizations, civic groups and other voluntary associations. in these social networks, the values and character of our citizens are formed, as we learn the habits and skills of self government, and acquire an understanding of our common rights and responsibilities as citizens. twelve years of republican rule have undermined the spirit of mutual dependence and obligation that binds us together. republican leaders have urged americans to turn inward, to pursue private interests without regard to public responsibilities. by playing racial, ethnic and gender-based politics they have divided us against each other, created an atmosphere of blame, denial and fear, and undone the hard-fought battles for equality and fairness. our communities form a vital ""third sector"" that lies between government and the marke place. the wisdom, energy and resources required to solve our problems are not concentrated in washington, but can be found throughout our communities, including america's non-profit sector, which has grown rapidly over the last decade. government's best role is to enable people and communities to solve their own problems. america's special genius has been to forge a community of shared values from people of remarkable and diverse backgrounds. as the party of inclusion, we take special pride in our country's emergence as the world's largest and most successful multiethnic, multiracial republic. we condemn antisemitism, racism, homophobia, bigotry and negative stereotyping of all kinds. we must help all americans understand the diversity of our cultural heritage. but it is also essential that we preserve and pass on to our children the common elements that hold this mosaic together as we work to make our country a land of freedom and opportunity for all. both republican neglect and traditional spending programs have proven unequal to these challenges. democrats will pursue a new course that stresses work, family and individual responsibility, and that empowers americans to liberate themselves from poverty and dependence. we pledge to bolster the institutions of civil society and place a new emphasis on civic enterprises that seek solutions to our nation's problems. through common, cooperative efforts we can rebuild our communities and transform our nation. combatting crime and drugs. crime is a relentless danger to our communities. over the last decade, crime has swept through our country at an alarming rate. during the 1980s, more than , americans were murdered, four times the number who died in vietnam. violent crimes rose by more than percent since and nearly doubled since . in our country today, a murder is committed every minutes, a rape every six minutes, a burglary every seconds. the pervasive fear of crime disfigures our public life and diminishes our freedom. none suffer more than the poor: an explosive mixture of blighted prospects, drugs and exotic weaponry has turned many of our inner city communities into combat zones. as a result, crime is not only a symptom but also a major cause of the worsening poverty and demoralization that afflicts inner city communities. to empower america's communities, democrats pledge to restore government as the upholder of basic law and order for crime-ravaged communities. the simplest and most direct way to restore order in our cities is to put more police on the streets. america's police are locked in an unequal struggle with crime: since the ratio of police officers to reported crimes has reversed, from three-to-one to one-to-three. we will create a police corps, in which participants would receive college aid in return for several years of service after graduation in a state or local police department. as we shift people and resources from defense to the civilian economy, we will create new jobs in law enforcement for those leaving the military. we will expand drug counselling and treatment for those who need it, intensify efforts to educate our children at the earliest ages to the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse, and curb demand from the street corner to the penthouse suite, so that the u.s., with five percent of the world's population, no longer consumes percent of the world's illegal drugs. community policing. neighborhoods and police should be partners in the war on crime. democrats support more community policing, which uses foot patrols and storefront offices to make police officers visible fixtures in urban neighborhoods. we will combat street violence and emphasize building trust and solving the problems that breed crime. firearms. it is time to shut down the weapons bazaars in our cities. we support a reason ble waiting period to permit background checks for purchases of handguns, as well as assault weapons controls to ban the possession, sale, importation and manufacture of the most deadly assault weapons. we do not support efforts to restrict weapons used for legitimate hunting and sporting purposes. we will work for swift and certain punishment of all people who violate the country's gun laws and for stronger sentences for criminals who use guns. we will also seek to shut down the black market for guns and impose severe penalties on people who sell guns to children. pursuing all crime aggressively. in contrast to the republican policy of leniency toward white collar crime -- which breeds cynicism in poor communities about the impartiality of our justice system -- democrats will redouble efforts to ferret out and punish those who betray the public trust, rig financial markets, misuse their depositors' money or swindle their customers. further initiatives. democrats also favor innovative sentencing and punishment options, including community service and boot camps for first time offenders; tougher penalties for rapists; victim-impact statements and restitution to ensure that crime victims will not be lost in the complexities of the criminal justice system; and initiatives to make our schools safe, including alternative schools for disruptive children. empowering the poor and expanding the middle class. we must further the new direction set in the family support act of , away from subsistence and dependence and toward work, family and personal initiative and responsibility. we advocate slower phasing out of medicaid and other benefits to encourage work; special savings accounts to help low-income families build assets; fair lending; an indexed minimum wage; an expanded job corps; and an end to welfare rules that encourage family breakup and penalize individual initiative, such as the $, limit on personal savings. immigration. our nation of immigrants has been invigorated repeatedly as new people, ideas and ways of life have become part of the american tapestry. democrats support immigration policies that promote fairness, non- discrimination and family reunification, and that reflect our constitutional freedoms of speech, association and travel. housing. safe, secure housing is essential to the institutions of community and family. we support homeownership for working families and will honor that commitment through policies that encourage affordable mortgage credit. we must also confront homelessness by renovating, preserving and expanding the stock of affordable low-income housing. we support tenant management and ownership, so public housing residents can manage their own affairs and acquire property worth protecting. national service. we will create new opportunities for citizens to serve each other, their communities and their country. by mobilizing hundreds of thousands of volunteers, national service will enhance the role of ordinary citizens in solving unresolved community problems. the arts. we believe in public support for the arts, including a national endowment for the arts that is free from political manipulation and firmly rooted in the first amendment's freedom of expression guarantee. iv.preserving our national security during the past four years, we have seen the corrosive effect of foreign policies that are rooted in the past, divorced from our values, fearful of change and unable to meet its challenges. under president bush, crises have been managed, rather than prevented; dictators like saddam hussein have been wooed, rather than deterred; aggression by the serbian regime against its neighbors in what was yugoslavia has been met by american timidity r ther than toughness; human rights abusers have been rewarded, not challenged; the environment has been neglected, not protected; and america's competitive edge in the global economy has been dulled, not honed. it is time for new american leadership that can meet the challenges of a changing world. at the end of world war ii, american strength had defeated tyranny and american ingenuity had overcome the depression. under president truman, the united states led the world into a new era, redefining global security with bold approaches to tough challenges: containing communism with the nato alliance and in korea; building the peace through organizations such as the united nations; and advancing global economic security through new multilateral institutions. nearly a half century later, we stand at another pivotal point in history. the collapse of communism does not mean the end of danger or threats to our interests. but it does pose an unprecedented opportunity to make our future more secure and prosperous. once again, we must define a compelling vision for global leadership at the dawn of a new era. restructuring our military forces. we have not seen the end of violence, aggression and the conflicts that can threaten american interests and our hopes for a more peaceful world. what the united states needs is not the bush administration's cold war thinking on a smaller scale, but a comprehensive restructuring of the american military enterprise to meet the threats that remain. military strength. america is the world's strongest military power and we must remain so. a post-cold war restructuring of american forces will produce substantial savings beyond those promised by the bush administration, but that restructuring must be achieved without undermining our ability to meet future threats to our security. a military structure for the 's and beyond must be built on four pillars: first, a survivable nuclear force to deter any conceivable threat, as we reduce our nuclear arsenals through arms control negotiations and other reciprocal action. second, conventional forces shifted toward projecting power wherever our vital national interests are threatened. this means reducing the size of our forces in europe, while meeting our obligations to nato, and strengthening our rapid deployment capabilities to deal with new threats to our security posed by renegade dictators, terrorists, international drug traffickers, and the local armed conflicts that can threaten the peace of entire regions. third, maintenance of the two qualities that make america's military the best in the world -- the superiority of our military personnel and of our technology. these qualities are vital to shortening any conflict and saving american lives. fourth, intelligence capabilities redirected to develop far more sophisticated, timely and accurate analyses of the economic and political conditions that can fuel new conflicts. use of force. the united states must be prepared to use military force decisively when necessary to defend our vital interests. the burdens of collective security in a new era must be shared fairly, and we should encourage multilateral peacekeeping through the united nations and other international efforts. preventing and containing conflict. american policy must be focused on averting military threats as well as meeting them. to halt the spread of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, we must lead a renewed international effort to get tough with companies that peddle nuclear and chemical warfare technologies, strengthen the international atomic energy agency, and enforce strong sanctions against governments that violate international restraints. a comprehensive test ban would strengthen our ability to stop the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries, which may be our greatest future security threat. we must press for strong international limits on the dangerous and wasteful flow of conventional arms to troubled regions. a u.s. troop presence should be maintained in south k rea as long as north korea presents a threat to south korea. restoring america's economic leadership the united states cannot be strong abroad if it is weak at home. restoring america's global economic leadership must become a central element of our national security policies. the strength of nations, once defined in military terms, now is measured also by the skills of their workers, the imagination of their managers and the power of their technologies. either we develop and pursue a national plan for restoring our economy through a partnership of government, labor and business, or we slip behind the nations that are competing with us and growing. at stake are american jobs, our standard of living and the quality of life for ourselves and our children. economic strength -- indeed our national security -- is grounded on a healthy domestic economy. but we cannot be strong at home unless we are part of a vibrant and expanding global economy that recognizes human rights and seeks to improve the living standards of all the world's people. this is vital to achieving good quality, high paying jobs for americans. trade. our government must work to expand trade, while insisting that the conduct of world trade is fair. it must fight to uphold american interests -- promoting exports, expanding trade in agricultural and other products, opening markets in major product and service sectors with our principal competitors, and achieving reciprocal access. this should include renewed authority to use america's trading leverage against the most serious problems. the u.s. government also must firmly enforce u.s. laws against unfair trade. trade agreements. multilateral trade agreements can advance our economic interests by expanding the global economy. whether negotiating the north american free trade area (nafta) or completing the gatt negotiations, our government must assure that our legitimate concerns about environmental, health and safety, and labor standards are included. those american workers whose jobs are affected must have the benefit of effective adjustment assistance. promoting democracy brave men and women -- like the hero who stood in front of a tank in beijing and the leader who stood on a tank in moscow - are putting their lives on the line for democracy around the world. but as the tide of democracy rose in the former soviet union and in china, in the baltics and south africa, only reluctantly did this administration abandon the status quo and embrace the fight for freedom. support for democracy serves our ideals and our interests. a more democratic world is a world that is more peaceful and more stable. an american foreign policy of engagement for democracy must effectively address: emerging democracies. helping to lead an international effort to assist the emerging - and still fragile - democracies in eastern europe and the former soviet union build democratic institutions in free market settings, demilitarize their societies and integrate their econ mies into the world trading system. unlike the bush administration, which waited too long to recognize the new democratic governments in the baltic countries and the nations of the former soviet union, we must act decisively with our european allies to support freedom, diminish ethnic tensions, and oppose aggression in the former communist countries, such as bosnia-herzegovina, which are struggling to make the transition from communism to democracy. as change sweeps through the balkans, the united states must be sensitive to the concerns of greece regarding the use of the name macedonia. and in the post-cold war era, our foreign assistance programs in africa, the caribbean, latin america and elsewhere should be targeted at helping democracies rather than tyrants. democracy corps. promoting democratic institutions by creating a democracy corps to send american volunteers to countries that seek legal, financial and political expertise to build democratic institutions, and support groups like the national endowment for democracy, the asia foundation, and others. china trade terms. conditioning of favorable trade terms for china on respect for human rights in china and tibet, greater market access for u.s. goods, and responsible conduct on weapons proliferation. south africa. maintenance of state and local sanctions against south africa in support of an investment code of conduct, existing limits on deductibility of taxes paid to south africa, and diplomatic pressure until there is an irreversible, full and fair accommodation with the black majority to create a democratic government with full rights for all its citizens. we deplore the continuing violence, especially in boipatong township, and are concerned about the collapse of the negotiations. the u.s. government should consider reimposing federal sanctions. the democratic party supports the creation of a south african/american enterprise fund that will provide a new interim government with public and private funds to assist in the development of democracy in south africa. middle east peace. support for the peace process now underway in the middle east, rooted in the tradition of the camp david accords. direct negotiations between israel, her arab neighbors and palestinians, with no imposed solutions, are the only way to achieve enduring security for israel and full peace for all parties in the region. the end of the cold war does not alter america's deep interest in our longstanding special relationship with israel, based on shared values, a mutual commitment to democracy, and a strategic alliance that benefits both nations. the united states must act effectively as an honest broker in the peace process. it must not, as has been the case with this administration, encourage one side to believe that it will deliver unilateral concessions from the other. jerusalem is the capital of the state of israel and should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths. human rights. standing everywhere for the rights of individuals and respect for ethnic minorities against the repressive acts of governments - against torture, political imprisonment, and all attacks on civilized standards of human freedom. this is a proud tradition of the democratic party, which has stood for freedom in south africa and continues to resist oppression in cuba. our nation should once again promote the principle of sanctuary for politically oppressed people everywhere, be they haitian refugees, soviet jews seeking u.s. help in their successful absorption into israeli society, or vietnamese fleeing communism. forcible return of anyone fleeing political repression is a betrayal of american values. human needs. support for the struggle against poverty and disease in the developing world, including the heartbreaking famine in africa. we must not replace the east-west conflict with one between north and south, a growing divide between the industrialized and developing world. our development programs must be reexamined and restructured to assure that their benefits truly help those most in need to help themselves. at stake are the lives of millions of human beings who live in hunger, uprooted from their homes, too often without hope. the united states should work to establish a specific plan and timetable for the elimination of world hunger. cyprus. a renewed commitment to achieve a cyprus settlement pursuant to the united nations resolutions. this goal must now be restored to the diplomatic agenda of the united states. northern ireland. in light of america's historic ties to the people of great britain and ireland, and consistent with our country's commitment to peace, democracy and human rights around the world, a more active united states role in promoting peace and political dialogue to bring an end to the violence and achieve a negotiated solution in northern ireland. preserving the global environment as the threat of nuclear holocaust recedes, the future of the earth is challenged by gathering environmental crises. as governments around the world have sought the path to concerted action, the bush administration -- despite its alleged foreign policy expertise -- has been more of an obstacle to progress than a leader for change, practicing isolationism on an issue that affects us all. democrats know we must act now to save the health of the earth, and the health of our children, for generations to come. addressing global warming. the united states must become a leader, not an impediment, in the fight against global warming. we should join our european allies in agreeing to limit carbon dioxide emissions to levels by the year . ozone depletion. the united states must be a world leader in finding replacements for cfcs and other ozone depleting substances. biodiversity we must work actively to protect the planet's biodiversity and preserve its forests. at the rio earth summit, the bush administration's failure to negotiate a biodiversity treaty it could sign was an abdication of international leadership. developing nations. we must fashion imaginative ways of engaging governments and business in the effort to encourage developing nations to preserve their environmental heritage. population growth. explosive population growth must be controlled by working closely with other industrialized and developing nations and private organizations to fund greater family planning efforts. as a nation and as a people, we have entered into a new era. the republican president and his advisors are rooted in cold war precepts and cannot think or act anew. through almost a half century of sacrifice, constancy and strength, the american people advanced democracy's triumph in the cold war. only new leadership that restores our nation's greatness at home can successfully draw upon these same strengths of the american people to lead the world into a new era of peace and freedom. in recent years we have seen brave people abroad face down tanks, defy coups, and risk exodus by boat on the high seas for a chance at freedom and the kind of opportunities we call the american dream. it is time for americans to fight against the decline of those same opportunities here at home. americans know that, in the end, we will all rise or fall together. to make our society one again, democrats will restore america's founding values of family, community and common purpose. we believe in the american people. we will challenge all americans to give something back to their country. and they will be enriched in return, for when individuals assume responsibility, they acquire dignity. when people go to work, they rediscover a pride that was lost. when absent parents pay child support, they restore a connection they and their children need. when students work harder, they discover they can learn as well as any on earth. when corporate managers put their workers and long-term success ahead of short-term gain, their companies do well and so do they. when the leaders we elect assume responsibility for america's problems, we will do what is right to move america forward together.","['new', 'covenant', 'american', 'people', 'two', 'hundred',

Republican Party,1992,1990,rep_1992.csv,CSV,"Preamble Abraham Lincoln, our first Republican president, expressed the philosophy that inspires Republicans to this day: ""The legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done, but cannot do at all, or cannot so well do, for themselves in their separate and individual capacities. But in all that people can individually do as well for themselves, government ought not to interfere."" We believe that most problems of human making are within the capacity of human ingenuity to solve. For good reason, millions of new Americans have flocked to our shores: America has always been an opportunity society. Republicans have always believed that economic prosperity comes from individual enterprise, not government programs. We have defended our core principles for 138 years. But never has this country, and the world, been so receptive to our message. The fall of the Berlin Wall symbolizes an epochal change in the way people live. More important, it liberates the way people think. We see with new clarity that centralized government bureaucracies created in this century are not the wave of the future. Never again will people trust planners and paper shufflers more than they trust themselves. We all watched as the statue of Soviet hangman Feliks Dzherzhinsky was toppled in front of Moscow's KGB headquarters by the very people his evil empire sought to enslave. Its sightless eyes symbolized the moral blindness of totalitarians around the world. They could never see the indomitable spirit of people determined to be free from government control - free to build a better future with their own heads, hands and hearts. We Republicans saw clearly the dangers of collectivism: not only the military threat but the deeper threat to the souls of people bound in dependence. Here at home, we warned against ""big government,"" because we knew concentrated decision-making, no matter how well-intentioned, was a danger to liberty and prosperity. Republicans stood at the rampart of freedom, defending the individual against the domineering state. While we did not always prevail, we always stood our ground, faithful to our principles and confident of history's ultimate verdict. Our opponents declared that the dogmas of the left were the final and victorious faith. From kremlins and ivory towers, their planners proclaimed the bureaucratic millennium. But in a tragic century of illusion, Five-Year Plans and Great Leaps Forward failed to summon a Brave New World. One hundred and fifty years of slogans and manifestos came crashing down in an ironic cascade of unintended consequences. All that is left are the ruins of a failed scoundrel ideology. As May Day lapses back into just another spring festival, the Fourth of July emerges as the common holiday of free men and women. Yet, in 1992, when the self-governing individual has overcome the paternalistic state, liberals here at home simply do not get it. Indeed, their party seeks to turn the clock back. But their ideas are old and tired. Like planets still orbiting a dying star, the believers in state power turn their faces to a distant and diminishing light. The Democrats would revise history to rationalize a return to bigger government, higher taxes and moral relativism. The Democratic Party has forgotten its origins as a party of work, thrift and self-reliance. But they have not forgotten their art for dissembling and distortion. The Democrats are trapped in their compact with the ideology of trickle-down government, but they are clever enough to know that the voters would shun them if their true markings were revealed. America had its rendezvous with destiny in 1980. Faced with crisis at home and abroad, Americans turned to Republican leadership in the White House. Presidents Reagan and Bush turned our nation away from the path of overtaxation, hyper-regulation and megagovernment. Instead, we moved in a new direction. We cut taxes, reduced red tape, put people above bureaucracy. And so we vanquished the idea of the almighty state as the supervisor of our daily lives. In choosing hope over fear, Americans raised a beacon, reminding the world that we are a shining city on a hill, the last best hope for man on earth. Contrary to statist Democrat propaganda, the American people know that the 1980s were a rising tide, a magnificent decade for freedom and entrepreneurial creativity. We are confident that, knowing this, they will never consciously retreat to the bad old days of tax and spend. Our platform will clarify the choice before our fellow citizens. We have learned that ideas do indeed have consequences. Thus, our words are important not for their prose but for what they reveal about the thinking of our president and our party. Two years ago, President Bush described the key elements of what he called ""our new paradigm,"" a fresh approach that aims to put new ideas to work in the service of enduring principles principles we upheld throughout the long twilight struggle, principles George Bush has acted decisively to advance. Thus we honor the Founders and their vision. Unlike our opponents, we are inspired by a commitment to profound change. Our mission combines timeless beliefs with a positive vision of a vigorous America: prosperous and tolerant, just and compassionate. We believe that individual freedom, hard work and personal responsibility - basic to free society - are also basic to effective government. We believe in the fundamental goodness of the American people. We believe in traditional family values and in the Judeo-Christian heritage that informs our culture. We believe in the Constitution and its guarantee of color-blind equal opportunity. We believe in free markets. We believe in constructive change, in both true conservatism and true reform. We believe government has a legitimate role to play in our national life, but government must never dominate that life. While our goals are constant, we are willing to innovate, experiment and learn. We have learned that bigger is not better, that quantity and quality are different things, that more money does not guarantee better outcomes. We have learned the importance of individual choice - in education, health care, child care - and that bureaucracy is the enemy of initiative and self reliance. We believe in empowerment, including home ownership for as many as possible. We believe in decentralized authority, and a bottom line, principled commitment to what works for people. We believe in the American people: free men and women with faith in God, working for themselves and their families, believing in the value of every human being from the very young to the very old. We believe the Founders intended Congress to be responsive, flexible and foresighted. After decades of Democrat misrule, the Congress is none of these things. Dominated by reactionaries, obsessed with the failed policies and structures of the past, the Democrat majority displays a ""do nothing"" doggedness: They intend to learn nothing and forget nothing. Seeking to build a better America, we seek to elect a better Congress. Finally, we believe in a president who represents the national interest, not just the aggregation of well-connected special interests - a president who brings unity to the American purpose. America faces many challenges. Republicans, under the strong leadership of President Bush, are responding with this bold platform of new ideas that infuses our commitment to individual freedom and market forces with an equal commitment to a decent, just way of life for every American. With a firm faith that the American people will always choose hope over fear, we Republicans dedicate ourselves to this forward-looking agenda for America in the 1990s, transcending old, static ideas with a shared vision of hope, optimism and opportunity.  Uniting Our Family Family: The Home of Freedom As the family goes, so goes the nation. Strong families and strong communities make a strong America. An old adage says, ""America is great because she is good; if America ceases to be good, she will cease to be great."" Our greatness starts at home - literally. So Republicans believe government should strengthen families, not replace them. Today, more than ever, the traditional family is under assault. We believe our laws should reflect what makes our nation prosperous and wholesome: faith in God, hard work, service to others and limited government. Parents bring reality to these principles when they pass them on to their children. As the book of Proverbs proclaims, ""Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it."" Imagine the America we could create if all parents taught their children the importance of honesty, work, responsibility and respect for others. We would have less violence in our homes and streets; less illegal drug use; fewer teen pregnancies forcing girls and boys to be adults before they have graduated from high school. Instead, we would have an America of families, friends and communities that care about one another. That kind of future is not a matter of chance; it is a question of personal responsibility. Barbara Bush captured the importance of that stewardship when she said, ""At the end of your life you will never regret not having passed one more test, not winning one more verdict, or not closing one more deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a child, a friend or a parent."" The Republican Party has espoused these principles since its founding. Families built on solid, spiritual foundations are central to our party's inspiration. At this time of great national and global transition, we renew our commitment to these fundamental principles, which will guide our family, our country, our world into the next century. Family: The Home of Freedom The rights of the family. Our national renewal starts with the family. It is where each new generation gains its moral anchor. It is the school of citizenship, the engine of economic progress, a permanent haven when everything is changing. Change can be good, when it liberates the energy and commitment of family members to build better futures. We welcome change that corrects the mistakes of the past, particularly those at war against the family. For more than three decades, the liberal philosophy has assaulted the family on every side. Today, its more vocal advocates believe children should be able to sue their parents over decisions about schooling, cosmetic surgery, employment and other family matters. They deny parental authority and responsibility, fracturing the family into isolated individuals, each of them dependent upon - and helpless before - government. This is the ultimate agenda of contemporary socialism under all its masks: to liberate youth from traditional family values by replacing family functions with bureaucratic social services. That is why today's liberal Democrats are hostile toward any institution government cannot control, like private child care or religious schools. The Republican Party responds, as it has since 1980, with an unabashed commitment to the family's economic liberty and moral rights. Republicans trust parents and believe they, not courts and lawyers, know what is best for their children. That is why we will work to ensure that the Congress and the states shall enact no law abridging the rights of the family formed by blood, marriage, adoption or legal custody - rights that are anterior and superior to those of government. Republicans oppose and resist the efforts of the Democratic Party to redefine the traditional American family. The right to a family. Every child deserves a family in a home filled with love and free from abuse. Today, many children do not enjoy that right. We are determined to change that. While government cannot legislate love and compassion, we can provide the leadership to encourage the development of healthy, nurturing families. We applaud the fine example of family values and family virtue as lived by the president and the first lady. We will promote whole, caring families by eliminating biases that have crept into our legal and tax codes. We will advance adoption through significant tax credits, insurance reforms and legal reforms. We encourage adoption for those unprepared or unwilling to bear the emotional, financial or physical demands of raising a child, and will work to revive maternity homes to ensure care for both mothers and babies. We applaud the commitment of foster-care parents who provide family environments for foster-care children. We abhor the disgraceful bureaucratic mismanagement of foster care. Big-city mayors have spent billions on social service bureaucrats who have lost track of many children. Many have no health records, no real residence, not even the simplest personal possessions. Shuttled from house to house, they lack discipline and identity, and are ripe for lives of crime. We are determined to reform this system to help these children. Broken homes can have a devastating emotional and economic impact upon children and are the breeding ground for gang members. We urge state legislatures to explore ways to promote marital stability. Because the intergenerational family is a vital element of social cohesion, we urge greater respect for the rights and roles of grandparents. Republicans recognize the importance of having fathers and mothers in the home. The two-parent family still provides the best environment of stability, discipline, responsibility and character. Documentation shows that where the father has deserted his family, children are more likely to commit a crime, to drop out of school, to become violent, to become teen parents, to take illegal drugs, to become mired in poverty, or to have emotional or behavioral problems. We support the courageous efforts of single-parent families to have a stable home. Caring for children. George Bush secured the American family's most important victory of the last four years: his child-care bill. He won landmark legislation - a voucher system for low-income households, allowing parents to choose what's best for their children, including care given by neighbors or churches. The Democratic Party opposed that legislation and instead sought government control of child care and fewer choices for parents. The president also advanced equity for families that forgo a second income to care for their children at home through his Young Child Tax Credit. Congressional Democrats are already trying to repeal it. The demands of employment and commuting often make it hard for parents to spend time with their children. Republicans advocate maximum flexibility in working and child-care arrangements so that families can make the most of their schedules. We support pro-family policies: job sharing, telecommuting, compressed workweeks, parental leave negotiated between employer and employees, and flextime. We reject the Democrats' one-size-fits-all approach that puts mandates on employers and takes choices away from employees. Most parents prefer in-home care of their children but often encounter government obstacles. Republicans will promote in-home care by allowing payment annually, instead of quarterly, of income taxes by employees and withholding taxes by employers. Our proposals for tort reform, now blocked by the Democrat Congress, will prevent excessive litigation that hampers the growth of child-care opportunities. By taking care of our children, we are taking care of our future. Family security. Over the last several decades, liberal Democrats have increasingly shifted economic burdens onto the American family. Indeed, the liberal Democrat tax-and-spend policies have forced millions of women into the workplace just to make ends meet. Because of their policies in Congress, fathers and mothers have a tougher time bringing home what they work so hard for. Between 1948 and 1990, under the Democrat-controlled Congress for most of those years, federal taxes on the average family of four rose from 2 percent to 24 percent of income. When state and local levies are included, the tax burden exceeds onethird of family income. The increase in the effective federal tax rate since 1950 has now swallowed up an ever increasing share of a family's earnings. Instead of working to improve their family's standard of living, they must work to feed government's gluttonous appetite. This is a scandal. In the 1980s, two Republican presidents kept Democrats from making matters worse. Presidents Reagan and Bush led the way to increase the personal exemption for dependents. We pledge to go farther to restore the value, as a percentage of average household income, it had 50 years ago. The value of the dependent deduction has eroded to a fraction of its original worth to families. Republicans call for a complete restoration, in real dollars, to its original value. Rather than fatten government bureaucracies with new programs to ""help"" families, we want to expand the Young Child Tax Credit to $500 per child and make it available to all families with children under the age of 10. When the Democrats establish tax policy that makes marriage more expensive than living together, they discourage traditional commitment and stable home life. We will remove the marriage penalty in the tax code, so a married couple will receive as large a standard deduction as their unmarried counterparts. Together, these changes will empower parents to care for their families in a way public services never can. Achieving educational excellence. In the earliest American communities, pioneers would establish a church, then a school. Parents wanted their children to have the best possible education, to learn what they needed to know to make a better life. Virtually every newly arrived immigrant family thought of education as the American way from the back to the front of the line. Americans have come to believe that only a country that successfully educates its sons and daughters can count on a strong, competitive economy, a vibrant culture and a solid civic life. As a result of this popular demand for education, Americans have created the most extensive and widely accessible educational system in the world. The people have insisted that primary responsibility for education properly remain with families, communities and states, although, from early times, the national government has played a role in encouraging innovation and access. In the 18th century, the Northwest Ordinance assured that school bells would ring amid frontier forests. In the 19th century, President Lincoln signed the Morrill Act establishing 50 land grant colleges. In the 20th century, President Eisenhower signed the National Defense Education Act, providing millions with a chance at higher education; and President Nixon signed legislation that today provides federal grants and loans to half our full-time college students. In the 21st century, the promotion of educational excellence will be more crucial than ever before in our nation's history. Recognizing what every parent knows, that our current educational system is not educating our children, President Bush is leading an educational revolution. We applaud the president's bold vision to change radically our education system. Our parents want it, our communities want it, our states want it, and our children want it - but the Democrat leadership in the House and Senate continue to thwart the will of the American people for radical change in the way we educate our children. The Republican strategy is based on sound principle. Parents have the right to choose the best school for their children. Schools should teach right from wrong. Schools should reinforce parental authority, not replace it. We should increase flexibility from federal regulation. We should explore a new generation of break-the-mold New American Schools. Standards and assessments should be raised, not reduced to a lowest common denominator. Communities should be empowered to find what works. The pursuit of excellence in education is a fundamental goal. Good teachers should be rewarded for teaching well. Alternative certification can bring desperately needed new people into the teaching profession. America needs public, private and parochial schools. Education is a joint responsibility of the individual, the family and the community. Parents are the first and most important teachers of their children. They should have the right not only to participate in their child's education but to choose for their children among the broadest array of educational choices, without regard to their income. We also support the right of parents to provide quality education through home-based schools. The Bush administration has sent to Congress several legislative proposals embodying these principles. The proposals, in spite of the fact that 1,500 communities across the nation have developed local committees to support them through the America 2000 strategy, languish in the Democrat Congress. And they are opposed by special-interest unions that have a power grip on the failed policies of the past. Improving America by improving our schools. For America to maintain her pre-eminence into the next century, our educational system must be revolutionized. Too many schools still teach in an outdated manner. Too many government and union rules have burdened our schools. And too much influence by lobbyists has blocked true reform. Even the most inspiring teachers are working within a system that stymies their creativity and fails to challenge their students. Creating the best schools in the world. We applaud President Bush's consistent and determined leadership in setting a new direction for American education. Our overriding purpose is clear: to create the best schools in the world for our children by the turn of the century. To do so, the president has established a bold strategy, America 2000, which challenges communities in every state to take charge to achieve our ambitious national education goals. The success of America 2000 will depend upon the local community, where implementation and ultimate responsibility rest. We have seen real progress. Perhaps most important, though, is that President Bush has fostered a national debate on education that has challenged every American to get involved. He has called forth American traits of ingenuity and ambition to create better lives for our children. As a result, a new generation of break-the-mold new American schools is taking shape. New and tougher standards and assessments are being established for what our children should know. The number of strings attached to federal school aid is being reduced. The president has shown unprecedented leadership for the most important education goal of all: helping middle- and lowincome families enjoy the same choice of schools - public, private or religious - that families with more resources already have. The president's proposed ""GI Bill for Children"" will provide $1,000 scholarships to middle- and low-income families, enabling their children to attend the school of their choice. This innovative plan will not only drive schools to excel as they compete, but will also give every parent consumer power to obtain an excellent education for his or her child. Republican leadership has nearly doubled funds for Head Start, making it possible, for the first time, for all eligible 4-year-olds to participate, should their parents choose to enroll them. The Bush administration has put a college education within reach of millions more students, young and old. The president has proposed allowing families to deduct the interest they pay on student loans, and penalty-free withdrawal of IRA (individual retirement account) funds for educational expenses. Ensuring high standards in knowledge and skills. For America to compete in a world in which 85 percent of all jobs will require high skills, we believe that students not planning to attend college need better opportunities. America's college graduates set the world pace for knowledge and skills. But we also have a strong commitment to the ""forgotten half"" of the students in our schools, students who will graduate from high school ill-prepared for work. We must build a well-educated, high-skills work force to ensure a new century of prosperity for America. The president has developed a sweeping youth apprenticeship strategy to meet this goal. His plan will ensure that students meet the high standards demanded of all high school students, while training them with a skill as well. We strongly support youth apprenticeships that include a year of college, to encourage a lifetime of learning and opportunity for students. Our educational beliefs. We are confident that the United States can, by the end of this decade, reach the six national education goals that President Bush and the nation's governors have established: that all children should arrive at school ready to learn; that high school graduation rates should be at least 90 percent; that all children learn challenging subject matter and become responsible citizens; that American children should be first in the world in math and science; that there must be a literate and skilled work force; and that schools must be disciplined and free of drugs and violence. We have an uncompromising commitment to improve public education - which means assuring that our schools produce welleducated, responsible citizens - not the maintenance of a government monopoly over the means of educating. American families must be given choice in education. We value the important role played by our private, independent and parochial schools, colleges and universities. We believe that their quality is best encouraged by minimizing government regulation. We believe distance learning is a valuable tool in the fight to bring equal educational opportunity to every student regardless of wealth or geographic location. Distance learning provides students access to the vast educational resources of our nation. We encourage the use of modern technology to meet the goal of educational excellence. We support policies that provide access for all instructional and educational programmers to permit them to provide the greatest choice of programming and material to schools and teachers. We also support policies that will encourage the use of all advanced technologies for the delivery of educational and instructional programming in order to give schools and teachers the greatest flexibility in providing creative and innovative instruction. We encourage local school boards to ensure review of these materials by parents and educators. We support efforts to open the teaching profession by reforming the certification system now barring many talented men and women from the classroom. Schools should be - as they have been traditionally academic institutions. Families and communities err when by neglect or design they transfer to the school responsibilities that belong in the home and in the community. Schools were created to help and strengthen families, not to undermine or substitute for them. Accordingly, we oppose programs in public schools that provide birth control or abortion services or referrals. Instead, we encourage abstinence education programs with proven track records in protecting youth from disease, pregnancy and drug use. The critical public mission in education is to set tough, clear standards of achievement and ensure that those who educate our children are accountable for meeting them. This is not just a matter of plans or dollars. Competency testing and merit pay for teachers are essential elements of such accountability. We are proud of our many dedicated, professional teachers and educators who have committed their lives to educating America's children. We also believe that powerful unions and liberal special interest groups should not be the driving force in educational reform. Just as spiritual principles - our moral compass - help guide public policy, learning must have a moral basis. America must remain neutral toward particular religions, but we must not remain neutral toward religion itself or the values religion supports. Mindful of our country's Judeo-Christian heritage and rich religious pluralism, we support the right of students to engage in voluntary prayer in schools and the right of the community to do so at commencements or other occasions. We will strongly enforce the law guaranteeing equal access to school facilities. We also advocate recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in schools as a reminder of the principles that sustain us as one nation under God. Our ambitious vision for America works, however, only in a society of well-educated citizens. The Democratic Party, beholden to the special interests that resist change, can never accomplish the improvements in education that our schools and our children so desperately need. Indeed, they have no plan. The Republican Party has started an education revolution. We have presented a detailed plan which is even now becoming reality. The future of our nation demands no less. The president is leading the country on an education crusade, a crusade the American people have joined. For healthier families: Promote health, prevent disease, reform health care. Americans receive the finest medical care in the world. We have the best health-care providers, the best hospitals and the best medical technology. People come here from Canada, from Europe, from every part of the globe, to seek procedures and treatments that are either unavailable or strictly rationed in their home countries. But we must do better. Costs are soaring. Many Americans, responsible for children and aging parents, worry about the quality and price of care. The 1992 election presents all of us with a clear choice. Democrats want a costly, coercive system, imported from abroad, with a budget set by Congress and policies set by bureaucrats. That is a prescription for misery. It would imperil jobs, require billions in new taxes, lower the quality of health care overall, drive health-care providers out of the profession, and result in rationing. The congressional Democrats' health-care reform proposal would exclude themselves from coverage under their own program. They refuse to live with the scheme they are trying to force on the rest of the county. Republicans believe government control of health care is irresponsible and ineffective. We believe health-care choices should remain in the hands of the people, not government bureaucrats. This issue truly represents a fundamental difference between the two parties. We endorse President Bush's comprehensive health-care plan, which solves the two major problems of the current system access and affordability - while preserving the high-quality care Americans now enjoy. The president's plan will make health care more affordable through tax credits and deductions that will offset insurance costs for 95 million Americans; and make health care more accessible, especially for small businesses, by reducing insurance costs and eliminating workers' worries of losing insurance if they change jobs. This plan will expand access to health care by: Creating new tax credits and deductions to help low- and middle-income Americans. These tax credits would be available in the form of vouchers for low-income people who work. Providing insurance security for working Americans by requiring insurers to cover pre-existing conditions. Making health insurance premiums fully deductible for the self-employed. Making it easier for small firms to purchase coverage for their employees. The proposal would allow small businesses to form health insurance purchasing pools that would make insurance more affordable. It also would guarantee the availability and renewability of insurance for small firms, set premium standards, pre-empt state mandated-benefit laws, establish minimum coverage plans, and require states to establish risk pools to spread risks broadly across health insurers. Addressing the medical malpractice problem by a cap on noneconomic damage recoveries in malpractice claims and an alternative dispute resolution before going to court. In short, the president aims to make coverage available to all, guaranteed, renewable, with no preconditions. Under his plan, no one will have to go broke to get well. The Democrats' plan stands in stark philosophical contrast. Instead of preserving individual options, it would rely on government bureaucrats. Instead of preserving quality care, it would lead to rationing and waiting lines. And instead of enhancing the health-care security of American workers, it would require a massive increase in payroll taxes that would destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs. The Democrats' so-called play-or-pay proposal would require employers either to provide health insurance for their workers or pay a new tax that would fund in part a new government-run health program. According to a study prepared by the Urban Institute, this mandate would require new federal taxes - or new federal borrowing - of $36 billion in the first year alone. Nearly 52 million Americans who now have private health insurance would be dumped by their employers onto the governmentrun plan. Additional costs to employers - particularly small employers - would total an estimated $30 billion in the first year. The Republican staff of Congress' Joint Economic Committee estimates that 712,000 people would lose their jobs because of the play-or-pay mandate. Republicans are also determined to resolve the crisis in medical liability, allowing physicians and certified midwives to deliver babies and practice in underserved areas. Meaningful medical tort reform would assure that doctors would not have to practice medicine under a cloud of potential litigation. We will reduce administrative expenses and paperwork by adopting a uniform claim and data system. We pledge our support for rehabilitation and long-term care coverage. We will curb costs through better prenatal and other preventive care. We encourage the application of the Good Samaritan law to protect health-care providers who wish to volunteer their time to provide patient care to the community. We encourage coordinated care in public programs and private insurance. We further support regulatory reforms to speed the development of new drugs and medical technology. The health-care safety net must be secure for those who need preventive, acute and long-term care. Special consideration should be given to abolishing or reforming programs which prohibit or discourage individuals from seeking to work their way out of poverty and dependency. We will reduce paperwork burdens and redirect those resources to actual services. We will enhance access to medical care through community health centers, which provide primary care in medically underserved areas. We will modify outdated antitrust rules that prohibit hospitals from merging their resources to provide improved, cost-effective health care. We encourage the use of telecommunications technology to link hospitals in larger communities with heath-care facilities in smaller communities. Advanced communications networks will facilitate the sharing of resources, will improve access to affordable health care through the transmission of medical imaging and diagnostics and will ensure that Americans living in rural areas have the same access to doctors and the latest medical procedures as Americans living in urban areas. Republicans focus on health, not just health care. We want not only to treat disease and disability but to reduce and prevent them. Through funding for NIH (the National Institutes of Health), we invest in research to cure a range of diseases, from cancer to heart disease, from multiple sclerosis to lupus. We support efforts which foster early cancer detection. Even more important, we rely on individuals to lower the incidence of preventable illness and injury. A large part of our health-care costs, public and private, is caused by behavior. Good judgment can save billions of dollars - and perhaps millions of lives. AIDS. The HIV/AIDS epidemic has exploded over the past decade into a crisis of tragic proportions. In our country, AIDS already has claimed more than 150,000 lives, and as many as 1 million more Americans may have been infected with the virus. Epidemics have, throughout history, challenged governments, which have too often been powerless to combat them. Science - and human wisdom - have advanced, however, and we have met this crisis not only with a massive commitment of resources but also with a personal determination on the part of the president. That commitment and leadership will continue. AIDS should be treated like any other communicable or sexually transmitted disease, while at the same time preserving patient confidentiality. We are committed to ensure that our nation's response to AIDS is shaped by compassion, not fear or ignorance and will oppose, as a matter of decency and honor, any discrimination against Americans who are its victims. We encourage state legislatures to enact legislation which makes it a criminal act for anyone knowingly to transmit the AIDS virus. We will seek to ensure that medical personnel, and the people who trust in their care, will be protected against infection. This disease also challenges America scientifically. We must succeed in slowing the epidemic's spread. The administration has thus placed great emphasis on a variety of prevention efforts to do so. We must recognize, also, that prevention is linked ultimately to personal responsibility and moral behavior. We reject the notion that the distribution of clean needles and condoms are the solution to stopping the spread of AIDS. Education designed to curb the spread of this disease should stress marital fidelity, abstinence and a drug-free lifestyle. There must be a means for successfully treating the virus, and this has led to a threefold increase in research and steps to speed the approval process for new drugs that could make a crucial difference to those infected. Above all, a cure must be found. We have committed enormous resources - $4.2 billion over the past four years for research alone, more than for any disease except cancer. In keeping with the American spirit, our fellow citizens with HIV/AIDS deserve our compassion and our care, and they deserve our united commitment to a cure. Healthy families. Responsible families are the key to wellness. They are the best guard against infant mortality and child abuse. We support programs to help mothers and their babies get a good start in life; and we call for strong action, at all levels of government, to enforce parental responsibility with regard to alcohol, drugs and neglect. We applaud the president's initiatives to require the involvement of more women in clinical trials and to create within NIH a center to combat breast and cervical cancer. We also call for expanded research on various diseases, common to both men and women, but whose effects on women have yet to be determined. We call for fetal protection in the workplace and in scientific research. The homeless. The Bush administration has worked vigorously to address this tragedy, believing that involuntary homelessness in America is unacceptable. Accordingly, the administration has proposed $4 billion in homeless assistance, an amount cut back by the Democrat-controlled Congress. We have also implemented a USShelter Plus Care program designed to assist homeless persons who are mentally ill, chemically dependent or stricken with AIDS. Republicans remain determined to help the homeless as a matter of ethical commitment as well as sound public policy. Older Americans. The interests of older Americans are addressed throughout this platform, for the elderly play an honored role in all walks of American life. From reducing inflation to fighting crime, from quality health care to a cleaner environment, the Republican agenda for all has particular relevance to those who have worked the longest and grown the wisest. We reaffirm our commitment to a strong Social Security system. To stop penalizing grandparents and other seniors who care for children, we pledge to continue the Republican crusade to end the earnings limitation for Social Security recipients. More than ever, our nation needs older Americans in its schools and workplaces. There should be no barriers to their full participation in our country's future. We pledge support for greater availability of long-term care and for research to combat Alzheimer's disease. Republicans also took the lead in expanding home health care in government programs, and we want to build on that accomplishment. Promoting cultural values. The culture of our nation has traditionally supported those pillars on which civilized society is built: personal responsibility, morality and the family. Today, however, these pillars are under assault. Elements within the media, the entertainment industry, academia and the Democratic Party are waging a guerrilla war against American values. They deny personal responsibility, disparage traditional morality, denigrate religion and promote hostility toward the family's way of life. Children, the members of our society most vulnerable to cultural influences, are barraged with violence and promiscuity, encouraging reckless and irresponsible behavior. This undermines the authority of parents, the ones most responsible for passing on to their offspring a sense of right and wrong. The lesson our party draws is important - that all of us, individuals and corporations alike, have a responsibility to reflect the values we expect our fellow citizens to exhibit. And if children grow to adulthood reflecting not the values of their parents but the amorality with which they are bombarded, those who send such messages cannot duck culpability. One example is the advocacy of violence against law enforcement officers, promoted by a corporation more interested in profits than the possible consequences of such a message. We believe, in the spirit of Theodore Roosevelt, that corporations - like individuals - have responsibilities to society, and that conscience alone should prevent such outrages. We also stand united with those private organizations, such as the Boy Scouts of America, who are defending decency in fulfillment of their own moral responsibilities. We reject the irresponsible position of those corporations that have cut off contributions to such organizations because of their courageous stand for family values. Moreover, we oppose efforts by the Democratic Party to include sexual preference as a protected minority receiving preferential status under civil rights statutes at the federal, state and local level. We oppose any legislation or law that legally recognizes same-sex marriages and allows such couples to adopt children or provide foster care. We must recognize that the time has come for a national crusade against pornography. Some would have us believe that obscenity and pornography have no social impact. But if hardcore pornography does not cheapen the human spirit, then neither does Shakespeare elevate it. We call on federal agencies to halt the sale, under government auspices, of pornographic materials. We endorse Republican legislation, the Pornography Victims Compensation Act, allowing victims of pornography to seek damages from those who make or sell it, especially since the Commission on Pornography, in 1986, found a direct link between pornography and violent crimes committed against women and children. We also believe that the various state legislatures should create a civil cause of action against makers and distributors of pornography when their material incites a violent crime. Government has a responsibility, as well, to ensure that it promotes the common moral values that bind us together as a nation. We therefore condemn the use of public funds to subsidize obscenity and blasphemy masquerading as art. The fine arts, including those with public support, can certainly enrich our society. However, no artist has an inherent right to claim taxpayer support for his or her private vision of art if that vision mocks the moral and spiritual basis on which our society is founded. We believe a free market in art - with neither suppression nor favoritism by government - is the best way to foster the cultural revival our country needs. Individual Rights, Good Homes and Safe Streets At a time when the rest of the world has rejected socialism, there are communities here at home where free markets have not been permitted to flourish. Decades of liberalism have left us with two economies. The pro growth economy rewards effort, promotes thrift and supports strong families. The other economy stifles initiative and is anti-work and anti family. In one economy, people are free to be owners and entrepreneurs. In the other economy, people are at the mercy of government. We are determined to elevate the poor into the pro-growth economy. Republicans will lead a new national consensus around economic opportunity, greater access to property, home ownership and housing, jobs and entrepreneurship. We must bring the great promise of America to every city, every small town, and to all our people. Our agenda for equality of opportunity runs throughout this platform and applies to all Americans. There is no such thing as segregated success. We reject the Democrats' politics of division, envy and conflict. They believe that America is split into classes and can be healed only through the redistribution of wealth. We believe in the economics of multiplication: free markets expand opportunity and wealth for all. That is true liberation. It frees poor people not only from want but also from government control. That is why liberal Democrats have fought us every step of the way, refusing congressional action on enterprise zones until Los Angeles burned - and then mocking the expectations of the poor by gutting that critical proposal. They can kill bills, but they cannot kill hope. We are determined to pass that legislation for the sake of all who are awaiting their chance for the American Dream. We will eliminate laws that keep Americans out of jobs, like the outdated ban on home work. The antiquated Davis-Bacon Act inflates taxpayer costs and keeps willing workers from getting jobs in federally assisted projects. It must go. Unlike the Democrats, we believe the private sector, not the federal government, should set prevailing wage rates. As explained elsewhere in this platform, low-income families must gain control of their future through choice in their children's education. Rebuilding the dream. Our party has always championed the American dream of home ownership. Abraham Lincoln wanted all families to have access to property, because it would give them a tangible stake in their family's future. As families built homes and improved the land, they built a brighter future for themselves and a legacy for their children. Lincoln's Homestead Act of 1862 did all this without enlarging government. It empowered families. In the tradition of Lincoln, President Bush has replicated the American dream of home ownership. For first-time home buyers, he has proposed a $5,000 tax credit. For lower-income families, he has worked to restore opportunity through HOPE, his initiative to help tenants now dependent on federal aid to buy their own homes; Mortgage Revenue Bonds, to assist more than 1.9 million families to buy a first home; Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, already producing more than 420,000 decent apartments at affordable prices; and HOME, a partnership among all levels of government to help low-income families secure better housing. For everyone, but especially for the poor, the best housing policy is non inflationary economic growth and low interest rates, the heart of our opportunity agenda. Ending dependency. Welfare is the enemy of opportunity and stable family life. Two decades ago, decisions about public assistance were taken away from states and communities and given to Washington officials. Since then, almost everything has gone wrong. Since 1965, we have spent $3.5 trillion on welfare. It brought a horrendous expansion of dependence, especially among mothers and children. Today's welfare system is anti-work and anti-marriage. It taxes families to subsidize illegitimacy. It rewards unethical behavior and penalizes initiative. It cannot be merely tinkered with by Congress; it must be re created by states and localities. Republican governors and legislators in several states have already launched dramatic reforms, especially with workfare and learnfare. Welfare can no longer be a check in the mail with no responsibility. We believe fathers and mothers must be held responsible for their children. We support stronger enforcement of child support laws. We call for strong enforcement and tough penalties against welfare fraud and insist that work must be a mandatory part of public assistance for all who are able to work. Because divorce, desertion and illegitimacy account for almost all the increase in child poverty over the last 20 years, we put the highest priority upon enforcement of family rights and responsibilities. Among these responsibilities is the obligation to get an education - a key to avoiding dependency. Families on welfare with school-age children must be required to send them to school or provide adequate home education in keeping with various state laws in order to continue receiving public assistance. Young adult heads of welfare households should be required to complete appropriate education or training programs. Safe homes and streets. One of the first duties of government is to protect the public security - to maintain law and order so that citizens are free to pursue the fruits of life and liberty. The Democrats have forsaken this solemn pledge. Instead of protecting society from hardened criminals, they blame society and refuse to hold accountable for their actions individuals who have chosen to engage in violent and criminal conduct. This has led to the state of affairs in which we find ourselves today. Violent crime is the gravest domestic threat to our way of life. It has turned our communities into battlegrounds, playgrounds into graveyards. It threatens everyone, but especially the very young, the elderly, the weak. It destroys business and suffocates economic opportunity in struggling communities. It is a travesty that some American children have to sleep in bathtubs for protection from stray bullets. The poverty of values that justifies drive-by shootings and random violence holds us hostage and insecure, even in our own homes. We must work to develop community-help projects designed to instill a sense of responsibility and pride. This is the legacy of a liberalism that elevates criminals' rights above victims' rights, that justifies soft-on-crime judges' approving early release prison programs and that leaves law enforcement officers powerless to deter crime with the threat of certain punishment. For 12 years, two Republican presidents have fought to reverse this trend, along with Republican officials in the states. They have named tough law and-order judges, pushed for minimum mandatory sentences, expanded federal assistance to states and localities, sought to help states redress court orders on prison overcrowding, and devoted record resources that are turning the tide against drugs. They have repeatedly proposed legislation, consistently rejected by congressional Democrats, to restore the severest penalties for the most heinous crimes, to ensure swift and certain punishment, and to end the legal loopholes that let criminals go free. Congressional Democrats reject Republican reform of the exclusionary rule that prohibits use of relevant evidence obtained in good faith and allows criminals, even murderers, to go free on a technicality. They reject our reform of habeas corpus law to prevent the appellate process from becoming a lawyers' game to thwart justice through endless appeals and procedural delays. They refuse to enact effective procedures to reinstate the death penalty for the most heinous crimes. They reject tougher, mandatory sentences for career criminals. Instead, congressional Democrats actually voted to create more loopholes for vicious thugs and fewer protections for victims of crime and have opposed mandatory restitution for victims. Their crime legislation, which we emphatically reject, cripples law enforcement by overturning over 20 United States Supreme Court cases that have helped to reduce crime and keep violent criminal offenders off the streets. For too long our criminal justice system has carefully protected the rights of criminals and neglected the suffering of the innocent victims of crime and their families. We support the rights of crime victims to be present, heard and informed throughout the criminal justice process, and to be provided with restitution and services to aid their recovery. We believe in giving police the resources to do their job. Law enforcement must remain primarily a state and local responsibility. With 95 percent of all violent crimes within the jurisdiction of the states, we have led efforts to increase the number of police protecting our citizens. We also support incentives to encourage personnel leaving the armed forces to continue to defend their country - against the enemy within - by entering the law enforcement profession. Narcotics traffic drives street crime. President Bush has, for the first time, used the resources of our armed forces against the international drug trade. By our insistence, multilateral control of precursor chemicals and money laundering is now an international priority. We decry efforts by congressional Democrats to slash international anti-narcotics funding and inhibit the most vital control efforts in Peru. We support efforts to work with South and Central American leaders to eradicate crops used to produce illegal narcotics. The Republican Party is committed to a drug-free America. During the last 12 years, we have radically reversed the Democrats' attitude of tolerance toward narcotics, vastly increased federal operations against drugs, cleaned up the military and launched mandatory testing for employees in various fields, including White House personnel. As a result, overall drug abuse is falling. We urge that states and communities emphasize anti-drug education by police officers and others in schools to educate young children to the dangers of the drug culture. Dope is no longer trendy. We oppose legalizing or decriminalizing drugs. That is a morally abhorrent idea, the last vestige of an ill-conceived philosophy that counseled the legitimacy of permissiveness. Today, a similarly dysfunctional morality explains away drug dealing as an escape, and drive-by shootings as an act of political violence. There is no excuse for the wanton destruction of human life. We therefore support the stiffest penalties, including the death penalty, for major drug traffickers. Drug users must face punishment, including fines and imprisonment, for contributing to the demand that makes the drug trade profitable. Among possible sanctions should be the loss of government assistance and suspension of drivers' licenses. Residents of public housing should be able to protect their families against drugs by screening out abusers and dealers. We support grass-roots action to drive dealers and crack houses out of operation. Safe streets also mean highways that are free of drunken drivers and drivers under the influence of illegal drugs. Republicans support the toughest possible state laws to deal with drunken drivers and users of illegal drugs, who deserve no sympathy from our courts or state legislatures. We also oppose the illicit abuse of legal drugs. White-collar crime threatens homes and families in a different way. It steals secretly, forcing up prices, rigging contracts, swindling consumers and harming the overwhelming majority of business people who play fair and obey the law. We support imprisonment for those who steal from the American people. We pledge an all-out fight against it, especially within the political machines that control many of our major cities. We will continue to bring to justice corrupt politicians and those who collude with them to plunder savings and loans. New members of the American family. Our nation of immigrants continues to welcome those seeking a better life. This reflects our past, when some newcomers fled intolerance; some sought prosperity; some came as slaves. All suffered and sacrificed but hoped their children would have a better life. All searched for a shared vision - and found one in America. Today we are stronger for our diversity. Illegal entry into the United States, on the other hand, threatens the social compact on which immigration is based. That is, the nation accepts immigrants and is enriched by their determination and values. Illegal immigration, on the other hand, undermines the integrity of border communities and already crowded urban neighborhoods. We will build on the already announced strengthening of the Border Patrol to better coordinate interdiction of illegal entrants through greater cross-border cooperation. Specifically, we will increase the size of the Border Patrol in order to meet the increasing need to stop illegal immigration and we will equip the Border Patrol with the tools, technologies and structures necessary to secure the border. We will seek stiff penalties for those who smuggle illegal aliens into the country, and for those who produce or sell fraudulent documents. We also will reduce incentives to enter the United States by promoting initiatives such as the North American Free Trade Agreement. In creating new economic opportunity in Mexico, a NAFTA removes the incentive to cross the border illegally in search of work. Individual rights. The protection of individual rights is the foundation for opportunity and security. The Republican Party is unique in this regard. Since its inception, it has respected every person, even when that proposition was not universally popular. Today, as in the day of Lincoln, we insist that no American's rights are negotiable. That is why we declare that bigotry and prejudice have no place in American life. We denounce all who practice or promote racism, anti Semitism or religious intolerance. We believe churches and religious schools should not be taxed; we defend the right of religious leaders to speak out on public issues; and we condemn the cowardly desecration of places of worship that has shocked our country in recent years. Asserting equal rights for all, we support the Bush administration's vigorous enforcement of statutes to prevent illegal discrimination on account of sex, race, creed or national origin. Promoting opportunity, we reject efforts to replace equal rights with quotas or other preferential treatment. That is why President Bush fought so long against the Democrat Congress to win a civil rights bill worthy of that name. We renew the historic Republican commitment to the rights of women, from the early days of the suffragist movement to the present. Because legal rights mean little without opportunity, we assert economic growth as the key to the continued progress of women in all fields of American life. We believe the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life that cannot be infringed. We therefore reaffirm our support for a human life amendment to the Constitution, and we endorse legislation to make clear that the 14th Amendment's protections apply to unborn children. We oppose using public revenues for abortion and will not fund organizations that advocate it. We commend those who provide alternatives to abortion by meeting the needs of mothers and offering adoption services. We reaffirm our support for appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life. President Bush signed into law the greatest advance ever for disabled persons: The Americans with Disabilities Act, a milestone in removing barriers to full participation in our country's life. We will fully implement it with sensitivity to the needs of small businesses, just as we have earlier legal protections for the disabled in federal programs. We oppose the non-consensual withholding of health care or treatment from any person because of handicap, age or infirmity, just as we oppose euthanasia and assisted suicide. We support full access to the polls, and the entire political process, by disabled voters. We will ensure that students with disabilities benefit from America 2000's new emphasis on testing for excellence and accountability for results. Promoting the rights of the disabled requires, before all else, an expanding economy, both to advance assistive technology and to create opportunities for personal advancement. That is another reason why Republicans are committed to growth. We reaffirm our commitment to the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution: ""No person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."" We support strong enforcement of this Takings Clause to keep citizens secure in the use and development of their property. We also seek to reduce the amount of land owned or controlled by the government, especially in the Western states. We insist upon prompt payment for private lands certified as critical for preserving essential parks and preserves. Republicans defend the constitutional right to keep and bear arms. We call for stiff mandatory sentences for those who use firearms in a crime. We note that those who seek to disarm citizens in their homes are the same liberals who tried to disarm our nation during the Cold War and are today seeking to cut our national defense below safe levels. We applaud congressional Republicans for overturning the District of Columbia's law blaming firearm manufacturers for street crime. We affirm the right of individuals to form, join or assist labor organizations to bargain collectively, consistent with state laws. We support the right of states to enact right-towork laws. A Republican Congress will amend the Hobbs Act, so that union officials will not be exempt from the law's prohibition against extortion and violence. We call for greater legal protection from violence for workers who stay on the job during strikes. We support self-determination for Indian tribes in managing their own affairs and resources. Recognizing the government-togovernment trust responsibility, we aim to end dependency fostered by federal controls. Reservations and tribal lands held in trust should be free to become enterprise zones so their people can fully share in the nation's prosperity. We will work with tribal governments to improve education, health, economic opportunity and environmental conditions. We endorse efforts to preserve the culture and languages of Native Americans and Hawaiians and to ensure their equitable participation in federal programs. Uniting Our Country Security and Opportunity in a Changing Economy Over the last four years, the United States has achieved our overriding objective since the end of World War II. Communism and other forms of planned economies lie in the ash heap of history, defeated not only by our military strength but by the force of our ideas - democracy and free enterprise. Now a huge international market is evolving. Combined with America's low inflation and low interest rate environment, it presents us with unprecedented economic opportunity. We commit to the proposition that the American economy will remain first in the world. This is our goal. Achieving it will ensure that our people will enjoy the jobs, benefits and economic growth to sustain the American dream for themselves and their posterity. Republicans believe that the greatest engine for social change and economic progress is the entrepreneurial economy. We believe that America has broken down the lines of class to a greater degree than any society on earth, not because of government but because of an economic system that allows men and women to create wealth for themselves and their communities. We believe that positive change can occur and benefit all Americans if we continue to remove governmental barriers to entrepreneurship and, thus, economic growth. Our cause embraces traditional ideals and modern realities. It both reforms and innovates. We aim to shape history through faith in one another. Because we look forward, we emphasize saving, investment and job creation. We encourage innovation and the entrepreneurial spirit that are, together, part of our national character. We both conserve and develop our natural resources. Because we have learned from the past, we are determined to change what desperately needs changing in government. Government does not have all the answers, but we know where to find them: in the spirit of our people. We know the weapons for this battle: economic and political liberty in the pursuit of happiness. We understand that material gain improves life only if it lifts us all to pursue higher ends: self-respect, work and study, a decent life and future for our children, and a useful old age. So we rededicate ourselves to the truths the nation keeps coming back to -the simple, spiritual truths about our family, our country, our world - for upon them we will build our more perfect union. Security and Opportunity in a Changing Economy Our economy is people, not statistics. The American people, not government, rescued the United States from an economic collapse triggered by Democrats in the 1970s. Crippled by taxes, robbed by inflation, threatened by controls, stunned by interest rates, the people ended America's decline and restored hope across our country and around our world. We launched an era of growth and prosperity such as the world had never seen: 20 million new jobs in the longest peacetime economic expansion in the history of the Republic. We curbed the size and power of the federal establishment. We lowered tax rates. We restored a sound dollar. We unleashed the might of free people to produce, compete and triumph in free markets. We gave them the tools; they completed the job. During the 1980s and into the present decade, the U.S. economy once again became the engine of global growth. Inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 30 years. Interest rates dropped 15 percentage points. Productivity has sharply risen. Exports are booming. Despite a global downturn in late 1990, real economic growth resumed last year and has continued for five consecutive quarters. With low interest rates and low inflation, the American economy is poised for stronger growth through the rest of the 1990s. Keeping inflation and interest rates low and stable through a sound monetary policy is essential for economic growth. These gains were made in spite of the leaders of the Democratic Party. They continue to delay and defeat the president's agenda for growth, jobs and prosperity. Spending faster than ever, they blocked Republican reforms that would have saved billions of wasted taxpayer dollars. They refused to give the president a line-item veto to curb their self-serving pork-barrel projects. The congressional Democrat leadership killed the Taxpayer Protection Amendment for a balanced budget in the Democratcontrolled House of Representatives. It was supported by 98 percent of the Republican members; 57 percent of the Democrat members voted no. Then they rigged parliamentary procedures to forbid a vote on that amendment in the Democrat-controlled Senate. Every Republican senator voted twice to end the filibuster, while more than 70 percent of the Democrats voted twice to keep the filibuster going. Their nominee this year for the vice presidency supported the filibuster and spurned the balanced-budget amendment. They played citizens against one another, wallowing in the politics of hate and envy to smear the wonder of social mobility. They lied about America's achievement in the 1980s, rewriting history to erase the true accomplishments of the American people. Keeping what you earn. The test of economic policy is whether it promotes economic growth and expands job opportunities. Lower taxes and an expanding economy depend on long-term, consistent restraint in the growth of federal spending. In 1990, as the deficit was threatening to balloon and further harm the economy, the president pushed for cuts in government spending overall and for caps on mandatory spending. The Democrat Congress insisted, however, on a tax hike as their price for controlling spending. In short, the Democrats held the U.S. economy - and U.S. jobs - hostage in order to raise taxes, much as they had done to President Reagan. Just as they did with President Reagan, the Democratcontrolled Congress promised President Bush they would abide by binding controls on federal spending; and just as with President Reagan, they broke their word. Republicans will not again agree to such a program. This year, to create jobs and promote growth, President Bush submitted a program of tax cuts and incentives designed to get the economy moving again - a program very similar to one he had sent to Congress in early 1990. The Democrats' response was predictable - instead of cutting taxes, they passed a $100 billion tax increase that would have smothered growth and jobs. The president, true to our Republican philosophy, vetoed this tax hike, and sustained his veto with the support of Republicans in Congress. Now a new Democrat nominee comes forward with his plan for the economy. With a clean piece of paper, and every opportunity to end his party's romance with taxes, he has instead proposed the largest tax increase in American history. His tax increases, his proposed mandated benefits on small firms, and his further reductions in defense would cost the jobs of 2.6 million Americans. With his present spending increases, his plan would greatly increase the federal budget and the deficit. The simple truth for the American people is this: The only safeguard between themselves and Democrat tax increases is the use of the veto by George Bush and enough Republican votes in Congress to sustain it. The truth is that the Democrat philosophy of bigger government and rigorous redistribution of income requires them to push for ever increasing spending and ever higher taxes. The choice is clear - between George Bush, who vetoes tax increases, and his opponent, who proposes a $150 billion tax increase. Our Republican position is equally clear: We will oppose any attempt to increase taxes. Furthermore, Republicans believe that the taxes insisted on by the Democrats in the 1990 budget agreement were recessionary. The Democrat Congress held President Bush and indeed all Americans hostage, refusing to take even modest steps to control spending, unless taxes were increased. The American economy suffered as a result. We believe the tax increases of 1990 should ultimately be repealed. Just as history shows that tax increases destroy jobs and economic growth, it also shows that the proper path to create jobs and growth is tax rate reduction. We commend those congressional and senatorial candidates who pledge to oppose tax rate increases. As the deficit comes under control, we aspire to further tax rate cuts, strengthening incentives to work, save, invest and innovate. We also support President Bush's efforts to reduce federal spending and to cap the growth of non-Social Security entitlements. Republicans want individuals and families to control their own economic destiny. Only long-term expansion of our economy and jobs can make the American dream a reality for generations to come. That is why we demand that the Congress do what President Bush called for last January: open a new era of growth and opportunity by enacting his comprehensive plan for economic recovery, including a reduction in the capital gains tax; an investment tax allowance; a $5,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers; a needed modification of the ""passive loss rule""; a $500 increase in the personal income tax exemption; making permanent the research and development tax credit; and the passage of federal enterprise zone legislation. We support restoring the deductibility of IRAs for all Americans, including full-time homemakers, and encourage savings for education and home ownership through Family Savings Accounts. The president's Family Savings Accounts will be an impetus to the economy. Let families use their IRAs for firsttime home purchases, for college education and for medical emergencies. We will cut the capital gains tax rate to 15 percent - zero in enterprise zones - and index it so government cannot profit from inflation by taxing phantom capital gains, literally stealing from savings and pensions. We reject the notion advanced by Democrats that this enhances the wealthy. To the contrary, it would encourage investment, create new jobs, make capital available for business expansion and contribute to economic expansion. Reducing the tax on investment will be the biggest possible boost for the new technologies, businesses and jobs we need for the next century. If government taxes capital gains at such a high rate that there is no incentive to take risks, to build businesses, to invest, to create jobs or to better oneself, then jobs and small businesses vanish, and everyone's opportunities are diminished. Cutting the rate, on the other hand, will help supply seed capital where it is needed most - in our poorest communities. Refusing to cut it will handcuff America in international competition and will shackle aspiring entrepreneurs in inner cities and poor rural areas. To encourage investment in new technologies, we will make permanent the research and development tax credit. For the same reason, we want to expand deductibility for investments in new plant and equipment. We support further tax simplification. The tax code should create jobs for Americans, not profits for tax lawyers, lobbyists and tax shelters. Small businesses should spend more time hiring and producing, not filling out IRS forms. We oppose taxing religious and ethnic fraternal benefit societies because of their vital role in fostering charity and patriotism. We also oppose tax withholding on savings and dividends. We applaud the efforts by President Bush to help workers who change jobs by enhancing the portability of pensions. Leading Democrat members of Congress have called for a national sales tax, or European style value-added tax (VAT), which would take billions of dollars out of the hands of American consumers. Such a tax has been imposed on many nations in Europe and has resulted in higher prices, fewer jobs and higher levels of government spending. Republicans oppose the idea of putting a VAT on the backs of the American people. Republicans believe in expanding the economy. Jobs and growth are our answer to the future. The future is the family. The most dramatic change in the tax code in our lifetime is one that has never been explicitly enacted by Congress or reported as a specific new event. It is the gradual, year-by-year erosion of the personal exemption, until it was indexed by a Republican administration in 1986. Republicans also led the way in the 1980s by increasing the personal exemption from $1,500 to $2,000. This platform calls for another immediate increase of $500, but in the long run we are committed to fully restoring the inflation-adjusted value of the personal exemption. This will require reductions in federal spending, which is why the best hope for tax fairness for America's families lies in a Republican Congress. Liberation through deregulation. Government regulation is a hidden tax on American families, costing each household more than $5,000 every year. It stifles job creation and hobbles our national competitiveness. The ""iron triangle"" of special interests, federal bureaucrats and Democrat congressional staff is robbing consumers and producers alike. We support President Bush's freeze on new regulations. We applaud his Competitiveness Council, under Vice President Quayle, for fighting the regulatory mania, saving the public $20 billion with its initial 90-day moratorium on new regulations and billions more under the current 120 day freeze. We call for a permanent moratorium until our regulatory reforms are fully in place. They include market-based regulation, cost benefit analysis of all new rule-making, and a regulatory budget that will make Congress admit - and correct - the harm it does by legislation that destroys jobs and competitiveness. We recognize that property rights are being endangered by government over-regulation. We reaffirm the constitutional right to private ownership of property; this right is paramount in our free society. Every rule that reduces the value of private property is what our Constitution calls a ""taking."" This underthe-table taxation is unfair, immoral and economically destructive. We support legislation to require full compensation of property owners who are victims of regulatory takings. Home ownership. The best housing policy is a noninflationary, growing economy that has produced low mortgage rates and has made housing more affordable. We demand Congress enact President's Bush's housing program introduced as part of his pro-growth package in January. Provide a $5,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers and allow them penalty-free IRA withdrawals. Set a modified ""passive loss rule"" for active real estate investors. Extend tax preferences for mortgage revenue bonds and lowincome housing. And allow deductions for losses on personal residences. The average American's home is his or her primary asset. That asset should be completely shielded from federal taxation, allowing the homeowner to maintain it or access it as he or she sees fit. We call for the complete elimination of the capital gains tax on the sale of a principal residence. Owning a home is not just an investment. It is a commitment to the community, a guard against crime, a statement about family life. It is a crucial component of upward mobility. To advance these goals, Republicans are determined to preserve deductibility of mortgage interest. Bureaucratic government imposes too many regulatory barriers to affordable housing. These barriers must come down. We applaud efforts in the states to lower property taxes, which strike hardest at the poor, the elderly, families with children and family farmers. We advocate repeal of rent-control laws, which help the affluent and hurt low-income families by causing housing shortages. We support the FHA (Federal Housing Administration) mortgage insurance program, the Government National Mortgage Association, the VA (Department of Veterans Affairs) guarantee program and other programs that enhance housing choices for all. We urge federal departments and agencies to work with the private sector to bring foreclosed housing stock back into service as soon as possible. We reaffirm our commitment to open housing, without quotas or controls, as part of the opportunity we seek for all. For low-income families, the Republican Party stands for a revolution in housing by converting public housing into homes owned by low-income Americans. President Bush is eager to work closely with the states to fight and win a new conservative war on poverty. The truest measure of our success will not be how many families we add to housing assistance rolls but, rather, how many families move into the ranks of homeownership. But every part of that opportunity agenda has been thwarted by landlord Democrats in Congress. We ask the electorate: End the strangulation of divided government. Give Republicans the chance to move housing policy off the Democratic Party plantation into the mainstream of American life. Resident management and ownership of public housing reflects this American mission, not only to assure political freedom but to allow all our fellow citizens to build a better life for themselves and their children. Congressional Democrats have consistently blocked efforts to repeal the earnings test which prevents people over age 65 from keeping their jobs and remaining productive members of the work force. The Social Security earnings test discriminates against senior citizens. These senior citizens have to pay the highest marginal tax rate of any Americans. We support repeal of the Social Security earnings test. Controlling government spending. For 12 years, Republicans in the White House and Congress have battled a Democrat system corrupt and contemptuous of the American taxpayer. Our Republican presidents have vetoed one reckless bill after another. But liberal Democrats still control a rigged machine that keeps on spending the public's money. The only solution is for the voters to end divided government so that a Republican Congress can enact the balancedbudget amendment, requiring a supermajority for any future tax increases. And since the Democrat controlled Congress has consistently voted down a line-item veto amendment for the president to control specific wasteful pork barrel spending, a Republican Congress will adopt a line-item veto for the presidency, restore presidential power to rescind spending and to lower specific appropriations. Deficits have grown as Democrat Congresses have converted government assistance programs into entitlements and allowed spending to become uncontrolled. A Republican Congress, working with a Republican president, will consider non-Social Security mandatory spending portions of the federal budget when looking for savings. When legislators and bureaucrats waste tax money, they deserve to lose their jobs. When they save money, they deserve praise. When federal programs have outlived their usefulness, they deserve a decent burial. When federal judges dare to seize the power of the purse, by ordering the imposition of taxes, they should be removed from office by the procedures provided by the Constitution. The latest Democrat scam is to raise taxes for ""investment"" - a code word for more government spending. A Republican Congress will foster investment where it does the most good, by individuals within the private sector. Job creation and small-business opportunities. The engines of growth in a free economy are small businesses and jobs. Almost 99 percent of all businesses in America are considered small. Small business is the backbone of the American economy. For the past 12 years it has led the way in economic growth. Small business generates 67 percent of all new jobs. Employment in industries dominated by small business increased more than twice as fast as in industries dominated by large businesses. Small business plays a critical role in America's economic health. What happens on Main Street drives what happens on Wall Street. To create jobs and keep small business growing, the Republican Party supports increased access to capital for business expansion, exporting, long-term investment, opportunity capital for the disadvantaged, and capital to bring new products and new technology to the market. The Republican Party enthusiastically encourages the passage of federal enterprise zones. Enterprise zones have been effective programs for promoting growth in urban and rural America. Republicans believe that the concept of enterprise zones is based on unyielding faith in the entrepreneurial spirit of all Americans. Enterprise zones foster individual initiative and government deregulation. The states have come a long way in developing successful enterprise zone programs. State programs could only benefit from federal efforts. Congress should follow the lead of President Bush and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp in passing the federal enterprise zone program that will empower communities by reducing government regulation and taxation. The implementation of enterprise zones as an incentive for job creation and business development is also essential to further job and business opportunities. These efforts are bolstered by continued support of job training and minority business development programs, which have been created and implemented by the president's administration within the last three years. This is of special import to women, who own 32 percent of the nation's businesses, most of them small ones. Because the regulation of securities markets bars most small businesses from easy access to capital, we also support the Small Business Administration's Section 7(a) loan guarantee program and similar efforts that essentially compensate for the burdens government itself imposes upon entrepreneurs. Leading the information age. The nation's telecommunications infrastructure will be essential to growth and competitiveness in the information age. The most far-reaching transformation of daily life since the harnessing of electricity will mean unprecedented opportunity for rural areas, reduced commuting, health care in the home and empowerment for the disabled. Today, however, government policy at both the federal and state levels is standing in the way of this telecommunications progress. Existing judicial, legislative and regulatory market allocation schemes constitute a counterproductive industrial policy by prohibiting the full participation by all providers in all segments of the telecommunications marketplace. We need to liberate this future-oriented technology and, in turn, empower the American people by giving consumers a truly competitive choice and lower prices. As a result, we Republicans believe that full and open competition in the telecommunications marketplace is the most effective means for the United States to achieve our goal of having the most technologically advanced telecommunications infrastructure in the world. Jobs through science and technology. We believe technology holds the key to America's future - and the future is bright. America is not in decline. America is still the land of opportunity. The new horizon is science and technology. New discoveries, new challenges and new opportunities await us. Science and technology offer us change - exciting, dramatic and positive change in the well-being of every American. Scientific research and development in genetics, biotechnology and electronics will provide better, more affordable health care for all Americans. Distance learning, through technology, will help bring exciting, quality, affordable education to all students, even in rural areas and inner cities. Technology will help us conquer disease, protect the environment and provide a more abundant, healthier food supply. And technology will lead to better jobs and a better quality of life for all of us - and for our children and our children's children. Scientific and technological developments in telecommunications, high performance computers, high-speed data networks, digitization, advanced software, biotechnology, highenergy physics, advanced materials, superconductors, manufacturing processes, energy, transportation, agriculture, oceanography, atmospheric studies, geological research, space and the environment are some of the keys to increases in productivity. And increases in productivity will create economic growth and a higher standard of living for all of us. Technology is also critical to our national defense. We believe America must make technological development one of its highest priorities. We therefore support efforts to promote science and technology - providing funding for basic research, supporting investment in emerging technologies, improving education in science and engineering, enhancing tax credits for research and development, eliminating unnecessary regulation to create competitive markets, and protecting intellectual property. We further support efforts to increase the pace of technology transfer from the government to the private sector, where the fruits of this research can be used in the free market to create new processes, products and most important, jobs. We believe these policies will make us internationally competitive and will lead to a bright and prosperous future for our nation. President Bush has provided leadership in this area by developing budgets allocating major new resources to scientific endeavors. The National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the research and development program in the departments of Energy and Commerce have all become budget priorities under the president's leadership. The sad fact is, however, that the Democrat Congress has cut steadily and sharply in science areas in order to expand spending on social programs. This is shortsighted; the truth is that American innovation in science and engineering will expand our economy and jobs to greater social advantage to all Americans. A Republican Congress working with President Bush would reflect our interest in advancing scientific inquiry and assuring the resulting economic benefits for all Americans. Space. We are a pioneer people. Today's telecommunications revolution began with the first satellites of the Eisenhower years. So too, what we now do - or fail to do - in space will determine the future for generations to come. That is why President Bush established the National Space Council under Vice President Quayle. Together, they rescued a floundering program, revamped NASA, opened up competition and engaged the best minds of academia and research in a twofold mission for mankind. Mission to Planet Earth will define and perhaps mitigate effects on our fragile environment. Mission from Planet Earth will open space for science and industry. Especially in this Columbian year, we hail the president's decision ""to return to the moon, this time to stay, and then a journey to tomorrow, a mission to Mars."" Investments in space, though aimed at the future, pay dividends right now - in research and medicine, in international competitiveness and domestic opportunity. This must not be diverted to political pork barrels. The journey to the stars used to be a bipartisan adventure, but many Democrat officeholders have jumped ship. Republicans, by contrast, are determined to complete space station Freedom within this decade. Our agenda is to lower the cost of access to space, and to broaden that access to the private sector, with a family of new launchers; to build and fly sensors for the global environment; and to advance cutting-edge capabilities like the National Aerospace Plane and single stageto-orbit rockets, so technological breakthroughs can be quickly exploited. We will promote space-based industry and ensure that space remains a frontier for private enterprise, not a restricted preserve for government. We will continue international cooperation in space ventures and welcome Russia's cosmonauts and citizens of other nations to fly for freedom. Banking and job creation. Job creation and economic growth are dependent on a healthy and competitive financial services system that can respond to the needs of the market. The Democrat Congress stalled Republican legislation to prevent the savings and loan crisis. Then, last year, the Congress refused to pass the Republican administration's comprehensive financial sector reform bill to strengthen our banking industry and let it compete, both domestically and internationally, consistent with the principles of safety and soundness. We applaud the president's efforts to alleviate the continuing problems caused by lack of funds available to creditworthy borrowers in small businesses and the housing industry. We endorse his efforts to restrain overzealous regulators, reduce regulatory compliance costs, strengthen financial institutions through diversification and reduce unnecessary barriers to lending. Trade: A new world of growth. Four years ago, the American people faced an historic decision: Compete or retreat. They chose, with President Bush, to compete in the international arena. Rather than retreat with the Democrats to the limits of yesteryear, they decided to attack the international marketplace with characteristic American vigor. Just as George Bush is a proven world leader on the military front, equally he is an economic world leader. The results are spectacular. We have cut the trade deficit in half in just four years. The United States is again the world's top exporter. Exports drive our economy. Every $1 billion in exports creates 20,000 new jobs for Americans. Exports have created nearly 2 million new jobs at home since 1988. We are tough free traders, battling to sweep away barriers to our exports. We are waging the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations to win worldwide reductions in tariffs, elimination of subsidies and protection of American intellectual property rights. We are fighting to reduce farm subsidies in the European Community and to break up their government-industry collusion in production of civil aircraft. We firmly endorse President Bush's policy to support the Republic of China on Taiwan in international trade and her accession to GATT. Major market access gains have been made with Japan, with American manufacturing exports tripling since 1985. Throughout the world, we enforced greater compliance with U.S. trade rights. And we are making every effort to bring home a Uruguay Round agreement that is not only good for America, but great for tomorrow's entrepreneurs everywhere. The free-trade agenda for the next four years starts with the signing of a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico, completing the establishment of a free-trade area which already includes Canada. NAFTA will create the largest market in the world, greater than the European Community, with 360 million consumers and a total output of six trillion dollars. It means a net gain of hundreds of thousands of American jobs. We acknowledge the possible effects on regional markets, specifically agriculture. We encourage our negotiators to be sensitive to those market concerns. We will continue to fill the Pacific Rim with American exports, negotiating trade agreements with other Asian economies, and will complete our efforts - such as the Structural Impediments Initiative with Japan - to reduce barriers to American goods and services. And we will continue to negotiate the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative with Latin America as a first step in creating a hemispheric free-trade zone. Congress should report to the American people the cost to workers, consumers and businesses of every Democrat trade restriction, trade tax or trade quota bill it considers. We will not tolerate their obstructing the greatest expansion of international trade in history. Republicans welcome this opportunity; for we know America's workers, thinkers and builders will make the most of it. International economic policy. Twelve years ago, we unleashed a tidal wave of freedom around the world - not just political but economic liberty as well. What works in America personal responsibility, limited government, competition - works throughout the world. Because the world economy is interdependent, the United States has been affected by downturns elsewhere, particularly since 1990 with the crash of the Japanese stock market and Germany's economic difficulties. Now, as progress resumes, the Republican plan for global growth is vital for all nations, developed or otherwise. The continuing prosperity of our neighborhoods will depend in part upon the masterful diplomacy we have come to expect from President Bush. Economic freedom is an essential link to our foreign policy. It means expanded trade, but it also means dynamic growth based on shared values - a coming together of nations in the commonwealth of peaceful progress. To that end, U.S. aid, whether bilateral or through international organizations, should promote market reforms, limit regulation and encourage free trade. Chief among these market reforms should be the privatization of state owned industries such as telecommunications, power, mining and refining. Privatization should afford American companies the opportunity to purchase some of these assets, bring competition to these countries and substantially reduce our trade deficit. The United States government should take all possible steps to assist American companies wishing to invest in privatized industries by adopting policies, rules and regulations that will equitably facilitate these ventures, especially for small businesses. We will work with developing nations to make their economies attractive to private investment and will support innovations to guarantee repayment of their loans, including debt for equity swaps. Our experience can help them develop environmentally rational strategies for growth. Because we uphold the family as the building block of economic progress, we protect its right in international programs and will continue to withhold funds from organizations involved in abortion. Most important, we encourage developing nations to adopt both democracy and free markets. The two are inextricably tied and afford all people the greatest opportunities. Reforming Government and the Legal System Two centuries ago, the American people created a miracle - a system of government, founded on limited authority and the rule of law, a system that made government the servant of the people. Today it is in shambles. Citizens feel overwhelmed by vast bureaucracies. Congress insulates incumbents from public judgment. Huge problems get worse while committee chairmen play partisan games. The current legal system tends to breed delay, cost, confusion and jargon - everything but justice. Many of our once-great cities are controlled by one-party machines that promote and encourage corruption and incompetence. The Republic has not failed; the Democratic Party bosses failed the Republic. The Republican Party, now as at its founding, challenges a debased status quo. In Congress, the states, our cities, our courtrooms, we fight for the basics of self-government. We rely on what works, judging programs by how well they do instead of how much they spend. The Democrats believe in more government. Republicans believe in leaner, more effective government. We decentralize authority, returning decisions to states, localities and private institutions. The Democrat bosses want to concentrate power on Capitol Hill. Republicans place it in town halls and the American home. Republicans favor the free-enterprise system. We choose market forces - consumer rights - over red tape. The Democrats argue that government must constantly override the market. Republicans regard the worst market failure as the failure to have a market. We replace dependency with empowerment. The Democrats see an America filled with wards of the state. Republicans see an America peopled by citizens and consumers eager for the chance to chart their own course. We make electoral systems understandable and accountable to the voter. The Democrats fear proposals that would limit the tenure and hidden power of incumbent politicians. Republicans want the ballot box to prevail over the cloakroom. Cleaning up the imperial Congress. The Democrats have controlled the House of Representatives for 38 years - five years longer than Castro has held Cuba. They have held the Senate for 32 of those 38. Their entrenched power has produced a Congress arrogant, out of touch, hopelessly entangled in a web of PACs, perks, privileges, partisanship, paralysis and pork. No wonder they hid their congressional leaders during the Democrat convention of 1992. They didn't want Americans to remember who has been running the Congress. The Democrats have transformed what the framers of the Constitution intended as the people's House into a pathological institution. They have grossly increased their staffing, their payrolls, their allied bureaucracies in little-known congressional agencies. Congress has ballooned to 284 congressional committees and subcommittees, almost 40,000 legislative branch employees and staff, and $2.5 billion in taxpayer financing, amounting to approximately $5 million per lawmaker per year. Incumbents have abused free mailing privileges for personal political gain. Twenty two Democrats, with a total of 585 years in power, rule over a committee system that blocks every attempt at reform. The Democrats have trampled the traditions of the House, rigging rules, forbidding votes on crucial amendments, denying fair apportionment of committee seats and resources. They have stacked campaign laws to benefit themselves. The Democrat leadership of the House has been tainted with scandal and has resisted efforts to investigate scandals once disclosed. Some in their leadership have resigned in well-earned disgrace. The Democrat leadership of the Congress has turned the healthy competition of constitutional separation of powers into mean-spirited politics of innuendo and inquisition. Committee hearings are no longer for fact-finding; they are political sideshows. ""Advise and consent"" has been replaced by ""slash and burn."" Republicans want to change all that. We reaffirm our support for a constitutional amendment to limit the number of terms House members and senators may serve. We want a citizens' Congress, free of bloated pensions and perpetual perks. Congress must stop exempting itself from laws such as the minimum wage and the civil rights statutes, as well as laws that apply to the executive branch. The Independent Counsel Act is a case in point. It has permitted rogue prosecutors to spend tremendous amounts to hound some of the nation's finest public servants. If that act is reauthorized, it must be extended to Congress as well. Safety and health regulations, civil rights and minimum wage laws are further examples of areas where Congress has set itself apart from the people. This practice must end. Congress must slash its own bureaucracy. Its employees operate in a maze of overlapping jurisdictions. A Republican Congress will cut expenses by 25 percent, reduce the number of committees and subcommittees, and assign staff in accurate proportion to party strength. We will restore integrity to the House of Representatives, reforming its rules, allowing open debate and amendment. The committee system, both in Congress and in Democrat-controlled state legislatures, has been abused by chairpersons who have arbitrarily killed legislation that would have passed. Committees are a place for open and free discussion, not a closet for Democrats to stash Republican legislation. Democracy itself is endangered by these abuses, and Republicans condemn those practices. Both houses of Congress must guarantee protection to whistleblowers to encourage employees to report illegality, corruption, sexual harassment and discrimination. The Democrat rulers of Congress have blocked or stalled presidential initiatives in many areas, including education, housing, crime control, economic recovery, job creation and budget reform. They care more about scoring petty partisan points for themselves and their party than about achieving real progress for the nation. To accomplish change, we need a change in Congress. Reforming the congressional budget process. At the heart of the Democrats' corruption of Congress is a fraudulent budget process. They do not want the public to understand how they spend the public's money. At a time when the nation's future depends on reduction of deficits, the lords of the Capitol still play the old shell game. Republicans vigorously support a balanced budget, a balanced budget constitutional amendment and a line-item veto for the president. Republicans believe this balancing of the budget should be achieved, not by increasing taxes to match spending, but by cutting spending to current levels of revenue. We prefer a balanced-budget amendment that contains a supermajority requirement to raise taxes. We also propose procedural reforms. We support legislation that would require Congress to pass a legally binding budget before it can consider spending bills. The budget's spending ceilings shall not be exceeded without a supermajority vote of both chambers. If Congress fails to pass any appropriation bill, funding for its programs will automatically be frozen at the previous year's level. The key to prosperity for the rest of this century and for the next generation of Americans is a budget strategy that restores sanity to the budget process and checks the growth of government. Congress should be forced to confront basic arithmetic through Truth in Counting. The Democrats measure all changes in funding against a ""current services baseline,"" with built-in increases for inflation and other factors. If they want a $1 million program to grow to $2 million, they then count an increase to $1.5 million as a half-million dollar cut. This is the accounting system of Wonderland, where words mean exactly what the Democrat Speaker says they mean. The double-talk must end with zero based budgeting. We also support ""sunset laws"" that require government agencies to be reviewed periodically and reauthorized only if they can be rejustified. Cleaning up politics: The gerrymander. After more than a half-century of distortion by power-hungry Democrats, the political system is increasingly rigged. Throughout the 1980s, voters were cheated out of dozens of seats in the House of Representatives and in state legislatures because districts were oddly shaped to guarantee election of Democrats. It was swindle by law. We support state-level appointment of nonpartisan redistricting commissions to apply clear standards for compactness of districts, competitiveness between the parties and protection of community interests. Cleaning up politics: Campaign reform. We crusade for clean elections. We support state efforts to increase voter participation but condemn Democrat attempts to perpetrate vote fraud through schemes that override the state's safeguards of orderly voter registration. And it is critical that the states retain the authority to tailor voter registration procedures to unique local circumstances. Most of all, we condemn the Democrats' shameless plots to make taxpayers foot the bills for their campaigns. Their campaign finance bill would have given $1 billion, over six years, in subsidies to candidates. President Bush vetoed that bill. Campaign financing does need reform. It does not need a hand in the public's pocketbook. We will require congressional candidates to raise most of their funds from individuals within their home constituencies. This will limit outside special-interest money and result in less expensive campaigns, with less padding for incumbents. To the same end, we will strengthen the role of political parties to remove pressure on candidates to spend so much time soliciting funds. We will eliminate political action committees supported by corporations, unions or trade associations, and restrict the practice of bundling. To restore competition in elections by attacking the unfair advantages of incumbency, we will stop incumbents from warding off challengers merely by amassing huge war chests. Congressional candidates will be forbidden from carrying campaign funds from one election to the next. We will oppose arbitrary spending limits - cynical devices which hobble challengers to keep politicians in office. We will fully implement the Supreme Court's decision in the Beck case, ensuring that workers have the right to stop the use of their union dues for political or other non-collective bargaining purposes. Managing government in the public interest. The focus of government must shift from quantity to quality, from spending to service. Americans should expect measurable, published standards for services provided by government at all levels. Performance standards and rules, commonplace in the private sector, must be applied to government activities as well. Because federal government employees should not be a privileged caste, we will remove the bar to garnishing their wages to ensure payment of their debts. The Quality Revolution in American business has quietly but profoundly transformed American culture over the past decade. Millions of American workers have benefited from the more cooperative spirit the Quality Revolution has brought to tens of thousands of workplaces; and every American has benefited from the lower costs, higher quality service and greater level of competitiveness it has produced. Republicans are proud to have played a leading role in this transformation, especially through the annual Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, which recognizes companies that best represent the principles of quality. The Quality Revolution in the private sector, with its concepts of continuous improvement, profound knowledge and ""doing the right thing right the first time,"" stands in stark contrast to the outmoded practices, insensitivity and outright waste, abuse and corruption endemic in the bureaucratic welfare state. The Republican Party is firmly committed to bringing the Quality Revolution into government at every level by creating a ""Quality Workers for a Quality America"" coalition whose aim will be to transform the bureaucratic welfare state into a government that is customer-friendly, cost-effective and improving constantly. Privatization is an important alternative to higher taxes and reduced services. If private enterprise can perform better and more cheaply than government, let it do so. This is especially true of properties now decaying under government control, such as public housing, where residents should have the option to manage their own projects. These citizens should have the chance to become stockholders and managers of government enterprises and to run them more efficiently as private enterprises. We applaud President Bush's initiative to allow states and localities to privatize facilities built with federal aid. Where it advances both efficiency and safety, we will advocate privatization of airport operation and management. We deplore the blatant political bias of the governmentsponsored radio and television networks. It is especially outrageous that taxpayers are now forced to underwrite this biased broadcasting through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). We call for sweeping reform of CPB, including greater accountability through application of the Freedom of Information Act, a one-year funding cycle and enforcement of rigorous fairness standards for all CPB-supported programming. We look forward to the day when public broadcasting is self-sufficient. Always trusting the initiative of the American people over the ways of government, we will not initiate production of goods or delivery of services by the federal government if they can be procured from the private sector. We will not initiate any federal activity that can be conducted better on the state or local level. In doing so, we reassert the crucial importance of the 10th Amendment. We oppose costly federal mandates that stifle innovation and force tax hikes upon states and localities. We require that Congress calculate the cost of mandated initiatives upon communities affected and provide adequate financial support for mandates invoked. We will continue the process of returning power to local voters by replacing federal programs with block grants. Reforming the legal system. The United States, with 5 percent of the world's population, has two thirds of the world's lawyers. Litigation has become an industry, an end in itself. The number of civil cases in federal district courts has more than tripled in the past 30 years. It now takes more than a year to resolve the average lawsuit. Delays of three to five years are commonplace. The current legal system forces consumers to pay higher prices for everything from basic goods to medical treatment. Direct litigation and inflated insurance premiums sock American consumers for an estimated $80 billion a year. All told, our legal system costs, directly and indirectly, $300 billion a year. What it costs us in the world marketplace, by hindering our competitiveness, is beyond calculation. We therefore endorse the president's proposals for legal reform as developed by Vice President Quayle, and we salute his principled challenge to the American Bar Association to clean up its own house. We support the Fairness Rule, to allow the winning party to a lawsuit to recover the costs of litigation from the losing party. This will discourage needless suits, freeing legal resources for people with genuine cases. We believe complainants should have a choice of ways to settle problems through alternative dispute programs that will permit parties to pursue less costly and less complicated ways to resolve conflicts. We also call for greater use of judicial sanctions to stop frivolous lawsuits. We call for changes to the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) law to limit its use in civil litigation by requiring proof of all elements by clear and convincing proof. We seek to restore fairness and predictability to punitive damages by placing appropriate limits on them, dividing trials into two phases to determine liability separately from damages and requiring clear proof of wrongdoing. This will go a long way to reduce insurance premiums for professional and product liability and for all malpractice, including medical, thereby lowering costs for consumers throughout the economy, while preserving the ability of injured persons to obtain damages. It will also foster the creation of new products for the American marketplace, perhaps cures for the diseases we most fear. The Republican Party commends President Bush and Vice President Quayle for their continued leadership in helping volunteers overcome their concern that their good acts and voluntary donations of time on behalf of civic groups, community organizations and churches will result in civil liability and lawsuits. We encourage the state legislatures to pass the administration's model bill, ""The Volunteerism Act."" We will throw out ""junk science"" by requiring courts to verify the legitimacy of persons called as expert witnesses. To restore integrity to courtroom testimony, we will ban the practice of paying fees to experts only if a successful verdict is obtained. We will maintain diversity jurisdiction for citizens of different states to ensure access to the federal courts when appropriate. Because four-fifths of the time and cost of a lawsuit involves discovery - pretrial investigation of the facts - we will require automatic disclosure, by both sides, of basic information. We will ban abuses of the discovery process used to intimidate opponents and drive up their costs. We will fight rising health-care costs - and equally important, help dedicated doctors to keep practicing in critical areas like obstetrics - by providing incentives for states to reform their liability laws. This will reduce the practice of ""defensive medicine,"" requiring patients to be tested for every conceivable ailment at their own enormous expense to guard against the mere possibility of a lawsuit. Recognizing that legal reform can solve only parts of the larger problem, we support a federal product liability law. The cost of product liability protection is a great expense to the American consumer and seriously impedes our international competitiveness. For example, a consumer pays an additional 17 percent to cover the liability insurance of an ordinary stepladder. If 13 European nations can enact uniform product liability laws to give them a competitive edge against the United States, we can do it here, too - once we break the Democrat hold on the Congress so Republicans can put the interests of workers and consumers ahead of trial lawyers. Some of the problems in our legal system are rooted in a declining sense of, and respect for, individual responsibility. We reaffirm that all Americans are first and finally responsible for their own behavior. The nation's capital. We call for closer and responsible congressional scrutiny of the city, federal oversight of its law enforcement and courts, and tighter fiscal restraints over its expenditures. We oppose statehood as inconsistent with the original intent of the framers of the Constitution and with the need for a federal city belonging to all the people as our nation's capital. A new era for the territories. We welcome greater participation in all aspects of the political process by Americans residing in Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Northern Marianas and Puerto Rico. Because territorial America is far-flung and divergent, we know that any single approach to the future will not necessarily meet the needs of all. Republicans therefore emphasize respect for the wishes of those who reside in the territories regarding their relationship to the rest of the union. We affirm the right of American citizens in the United States territories to seek the full extension of the Constitution with the accompanying rights and responsibilities, and we support all necessary legislation to permit them to do so. The Republican Party supports the right of the United States citizens of Puerto Rico to be admitted to the union as a fully sovereign state after they freely so determine. We recognize that the people of Guam have voted for a closer relationship with the United States of America, and we reaffirm our support of their right to mutually improve their political relationship through commonwealth. We support American Samoa's efforts to advance toward economic self reliance through a multi-year plan, while ensuring the protection afforded to the people of American Samoa by the original treaty of cession. We support the full extension of rights and responsibilities under the U.S. Constitution to American citizens of the Virgin Islands. We commend President Bush for the successful development of self government in Micronesia and the Marshall Islands and for efforts to conclude the United Nations' last trusteeship in Palau consistent with the people's right of self-determination. Our Land, Food and Resources We hold the resources of our country in stewardship. Our heritage from the past must be our legacy to generations to come. Our people have always known that, as they cherished their land and turned earth and rock into food, fiber and power. In the process, they built the world's most formidable economy, sustained by its raw materials, driven by its energy resources. They brought comfort to the home, transformed the nation and fed the world. Agriculture and energy remain building blocks of modern life. Their vitality is crucial to the nation's growth. Indeed, to its survival. While supporting conservation, we reject the notion that there are limits to growth. Human ingenuity is the ultimate resource, and it knows no limits. The true measure of America's economic success is not whether austerity can be shared by many, but whether prosperity can be achieved for all. We advocate privatizing those government agencies and assets that would be more productive and better maintained in private ownership. We support efforts to decentralize government monopolies that poorly serve the public and waste taxpayers' dollars. Agriculture. The Republican Party is the home of the farmer, rancher and forester. We have long championed their right to pursue growth, efficiency and competitiveness through market incentives, diversification and personal ingenuity. And for good reason. Their industry provides consumers with the highestquality food and fiber for the smallest percentage of disposable income of any nation in the history of the world. They have been pioneer environmentalists. They have turned over to their children and grandchildren land that has been nurtured to expand its productivity while conserving this vital resource. Even more important, they have cultivated in their homes strong family life and moral virtues. We endorse American Samoa's time-honored land tenure system, which fosters self-reliance and strong extended family values. When we lose farmers, we lose much more than agriculture. We are committed to bringing our farm families the full benefit of a growing and diversified rural economy. Our rural families also deserve to be brought into the mainstream of health care, with tax policies that provide all who are self-employed full deductibility of their health insurance premiums. We stand with farmers against attempts by liberal Democrats to repeal the laws of economics by dictating price levels and restricting production. We stand with them against agriculture embargoes. We reject the notion that elected officials and bureaucrats make better farm managers than farmers themselves. We remain strong in our support of livestock agriculture. We believe in the humane treatment of animals, but we oppose attempts by animal rights extremists to impose excessive restrictions on animal husbandry practices. Our Omnibus Farm Bills of 1985 and 1990 gave farmers greater flexibility in decisions concerning management of their farms and marketing of their commodities. We have reduced government control and ownership of commodity inventories. Export sales and profitability have improved significantly. Agricultural debt has fallen by 30 percent. Under this president and sound Republican policies, net farm income has reached record levels. At the same time, we cut by two-thirds the cost of government commodity programs. Only one-half of 1 percent of the federal budget is now spent on those programs. By reducing dependency on government, we have created a healthier agricultural sector. We will build upon our 1985 and 1990 legislation and repeal obsolete or unworkable statues while continuing to provide a viable base of support for U.S. farmers. Agricultural prosperity is essential to the nation's global competitiveness. We will continue to expand the growth of American agriculture through exports, development of new products and new markets. Commodity exports this year will hit $40 billion, a 50 percent increase over the levels of five years ago. There has never been an annual deficit in our balance of agricultural trade, and the positive balance this year will be $18 billion. We pledge to fight unfair competition and to bring down the walls of protectionism around the world that unfairly inhibit competitiveness of U.S. farm exports. We pledge continued pressure to open world markets through the Uruguay Round, the North American Free Trade Agreement and bilateral negotiations. We affirm that there will be no GATT agreement unless it improves opportunities for U.S. farmers to compete in world markets. We repeat our demands for cutbacks in export subsidies by the European Community and elsewhere, and we will fight the use of arbitrary health and sanitation standards to sabotage U.S. exports. New markets for agricultural products will also be created as producers translate technological breakthroughs into new uses, such as soy oil diesel and biodegradable plastics. We support the widest possible use of ethanol in the U.S. motor fuel market, including in oxygenated fuels programs and as ethanol blends in reformulated gasolines. In addition, the Republican Party supports increased research and development to reduce ethanol production costs and expand its use in motor fuel markets. Such use will greatly help American farmers, improve the rural economy and reduce our dependence on imported oil. Building our farm economy requires meeting our farmers' financing needs. Critical to these needs are competitive, reasonable interests rates for U.S. producers. Under George Bush, interest rates have been dramatically reduced, thereby contributing substantially to improving the net income of American farm and ranch families. We will continue working to ensure that farmers have access to credit, with particular consideration to the needs of young and beginning farmers. We recognize the importance of efficient, equitable transportation systems to the economic viability of agricultural exports; and we will work to achieve greater efficiencies within the U.S. maritime industry and to decrease the cost to agriculture of shipping services. We support farm conservation efforts, both those pioneered in our 1985 farm bill and entirely voluntary undertakings, which result in three times as much erosion control as those mandated by law. We support the Conservation Reserve, with more than 35 million acres now enrolled. It shows what farmers can do through incentives rather than government controls. We value our nation's real wetlands habitat and the diversity of our native animal and plant life. We oppose, however, bureaucratic harassment of farm, ranch and timber families under statutes regarding endangered species and wetlands. When actions are required to protect an endangered species, we recognize that jobs can be lost, communities displaced and economic progress for all denied. Accordingly, prior to the implementation of a recovery plan for a species declared to be endangered, we will require the Congress to affirm the priority of the species on the endangered list and the specific measures to be taken in any recovery plan. These acts should not rest with the rubber stamp of a bureaucrat. With regard to wetlands, following our principle that environmental protection be reasonable, land that is not truly wet would not be classified as a wetland. Protection of environmentally sensitive wetlands must not come at the price of disparaging landowners' property rights. Thus, we endorse, as President Bush has done, legislation to discourage government activities that ignore property rights. We also find intolerable the use of taxpayer funds, through the Legal Services Corporation, to attack the agricultural community. Power for progress. Energy sustains life as we know it: our standard of living, the prospect for economic growth, the way our children will live in the century ahead. Republican energy policy, now as in the past, reflects the common-sense aspirations of the American people. Our goals address our fundamental needs: an energy supply, available to all, that remains reasonably priced, secure and clean, produced by strong energy industries on which the country can rely, operating in an environmentally responsible manner and producing from domestically available energy resources to the maximum extent practicable. Anyone older than a teenager can remember the energy upheavals of the bad old days, when political games threw the nation into a tailspin. Stranded in gasoline lines, shocked by home heating bills, shutting down factory operations, America's motorists, homeowners and workers rightly blamed official Washington for wrecking something that had always worked so efficiently that it was taken for granted. Today, after 12 years of Republican reform, we can again have confidence in our energy policies. The average household spends 11 percent less on energy, as adjusted for inflation, than it did in 1980, because of both conservation and lower costs. We broke the shackles of bureaucratic regulation by ending petroleum price and allocation controls, deregulating natural gas wellhead prices, and repealing restrictions on the use of clean-burning natural gas by industry and utilities. We repealed the windfall profit tax on crude oil that penalized investment in domestic oil production. We promoted free competition in an open marketplace and ended the public subsidy to the synthetic fuels program. And we broke the back of OPEC, the international energy cartel. And, equally important, we undertook a re-evaluation of estimates of our domestic energy resource base, which the Carter administration had determined to be inadequate. The Republican administration correctly found that we can indeed continue to supply a significant amount of our domestically available energy resources, including natural gas and coal, for all energy consumption needs well into the next century. When Iraq's dictator moved to seize the world's energy lifeline by controlling the Persian Gulf, George Bush did more than liberate Kuwait. He prevented an energy crisis and economic shutdown in America. Now his national energy strategy leads toward continued growth in the century ahead. It provides the nation with a comprehensive and balanced strategy for America's energy future. Specifically, it promotes adequate energy supplies and reduces consumer costs by relying on market forces, diversifying domestic energy sources and improving the efficiency and flexibility of energy consumption. We seek to foster greater competition and increased output, in the interest of producers and consumers alike. The domestic oil and gas industry saves us from total dependence on unreliable foreign imports. But over the past decade, it has lost more than 300,000 jobs. Drilling rigs are still. Crippled by environmental rules and taxes, independent producers have been devastated and major companies are moving operations overseas. We will reverse that situation by allowing access, under environmental safeguards, to the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, possibly one of the largest petroleum reserves in our country, and to selected areas of the outer continental shelf (OCS). We support incentives to encourage domestic investment for onshore and OCS oil and gas exploration and development, including relief from the alternative minimum tax, credits for enhanced oil recovery and geological exploration under known geological oil fields and producing geological structures, and modified percentage depletion rules to benefit marginal production. We will ensure that royalty payments on federal lands remain consistent with changing economic conditions. Most important, unlike Democrat no-growth fanatics, we know what is most at stake in the energy debate: the family's standard of living, including job opportunities, household income and the environment in which we live. That is why we have been supporting complete decontrol of wellhead prices for clean natural gas, which have already declined 10 percent in the last four years while consumption increased by the same amount. We support replacing government controls with the power of the market to determine transactions between buyers and sellers of natural gas. We encourage the use of natural gas for both vehicles and electricity generation, and the expansion of research, development and demonstration for enduse natural gas technologies. We will foster more public-private partnerships to advance use of natural gas. The Republican Party has a deep and abiding commitment to America's mining industry. We support the original intent of the Mining Law of 1872: to provide the security necessary for miners to risk capital investment on federal lands, thus preserving jobs and bolstering the domestic economy. We support clean coal technologies to allow greater use of America's most abundant fossil fuel within standards required by the Clean Air Act. We encourage the export of U.S. coal. We support acceleration of the international transfer of coalrelated technologies to boost exports for U.S. coal, in order to capitalize on America's leadership in these technologies. We oppose any attempt to impose a carbon tax as proposed by liberal Democrats. We endorse major national projects, like the superconducting super collider, which offer the promise of developing more efficient ways to store, transport and use energy. We will hasten development of the next generation of nuclear power plants - one of the cleanest, safest energy sources of all. Republicans back reform of the nuclear licensing process. We will site and license a permanent waste depository and a monitored retrievable storage facility. We reject the scare tactics used against nuclear power by those who want to shut down this essential contributor to the American future. We endorse development of renewable energy sources and research on fuel cells, conservation, hydro, solar, hydrogren and wind power as components of our overall plan for energy security and environmental quality. Public lands. The millions of acres that constitute this nation's public lands must continue to provide for a number of uses. We are committed to the multiple use of our public lands. We believe that recreation, forestry, ranching, mining, oil and gas exploration, and production on our public lands can be conducted in a way compatible with their conservation. The United States has some of the richest mineral resources in the world. Our public lands should not be arbitrarily locked up and put off limits to responsible uses. Approximately 50 percent of the lands in the West are owned by the federal government. These lands are a deeply intermingled patchwork built of public and private ownership. In order to provide an economic base for the people of the West, a publicprivate cooperative partnership on these lands for multiple use in an environmentally sound manner is imperative. Transportation. From its founding, the Republican Party has considered the nation's transportation system crucial to economic opportunity for all. That is why our 1860 platform endorsed the transcontinental railroad. It is why President Eisenhower signed the Interstate and Defense Highway Act, bringing America closer together and launching a lengthy economic expansion. Today, America's transportation system is safer, more efficient, more reliable than that of any other country. It employs one of every 10 workers and accounts for $800 billion in spending. It enables us to compete in the world market and gives us more choices in our daily lives. Under President Bush, that system has been strengthened by revolutionary legislation to pave the way into the century ahead. Providing $151 billion for highways and transit systems, it is the most extensive transportation improvement project in our nation's history - and a tremendous jobs program as well. Highway death rates have dropped to an all-time low, largely due to better road design and stronger safety programs. This progress would be wiped out by the Democrats' draconian plan for higher Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. Their national nominees want to require a 45 miles-per-gallon standard. That means unsafe vehicles, reduced consumer choice, higher car costs and a loss of 300,000 jobs in the auto industry here at home. To reduce the congestion that still chokes urban areas, we established a National Highway System of 155,000 miles, giving states and localities greater voice in decisions about projects. It will improve connections between ports and highways, airports and railways; spur development of new airports and reduce their environmental impact; promote private investment in transportation; and foster high-tech solutions to congestion. To keep America on the move, we assert the same principle that guides us in all other sectors of the economy: consumers benefit through competition within the private sector. That is why we will complete the job of trucking deregulation. We will also abolish the Interstate Commerce Commission, finally freeing shippers and consumers from horse-and-buggy regulation. We applaud the president's executive order that will assist communities to privatize government-controlled ventures, such as airports and toll roads. Our tough trade campaign, along with regulatory reforms, will assure U.S. air carriers fair access to international routes and allow the U.S. merchant marine to sail over foreign protectionism. The president has proposed and will aggressively pursue a comprehensive revision of existing maritime policy. Regulatory reform of airlines now allows more people to fly more safely, at better prices. Tough laws for drug and alcohol testing are making all modes of transportation safer than ever. Disabled persons will have greater access to the entire transportation network under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Wherever possible, the market should allocate investment in transportation, steering the development of passenger rail, mass transit and highways to best suit consumers. States and localities should have discretion in using Highway Trust Fund revenues to construct new roads, expand existing ones or invest in mass transit facilities, as they see fit. We advocate development of high-speed rail systems, through private investment, to serve intercity travel. We also advocate development of short-haul aircraft with vertical takeoff and landing capability, to bring commerce and jobs to communities large and small. We will continue aggressively to support development of intelligent highway systems, an efficient battery for electric cars, perfected natural gas vehicles, greater private investment in space travel and removal of regulatory impediments to intermodal transport. Because Republicans advocate personal responsibility, we salute groups, organizations and individuals that take direct action to improve safe driving and street safety. Environment. Cleaning up America is a labor of love for family, neighborhood and the nation. In the Republican tradition of conserving the past to enrich the future, we have made the United States the world's leader in environmental progress. We spend more than any other country on environmental protection. Over the last 20 years, our country has spent $1 trillion to clean its air, water and land. We increased GNP by 70 percent while cutting lead in the air by 97 percent. Our rivers run cleaner than ever in memory. We've preserved parks, wilderness and wildlife. The price of progress is now about $115 billion a year, almost 2 percent of GNP; and that will grow to 3 percent by 2000. Clearly we have led the world in investment in environmental protection. We have taught the world three vital lessons. First, environmental progress is integrally related to economic advancement. Second, economic growth generates the capital to pay for environmental gains. Third, private ownership and economic freedom are the best security against environmental degradation. The ghastly truth about state socialism is now exposed in what used to be the Soviet Union: dead rivers and seas, poisoned land, dying people. Liberal Democrats think people are the problem. We know people are the solution. Respecting the people's rights and views, we applied market based solutions to environmental problems. President Bush's landmark Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, the toughest environmental law ever enacted, uses an innovative system of emission credits to achieve its dramatic reductions. This will save $1 billion over the Democrats' command-and-control approach. Other provisions of that law will cut acid rain emissions in half, reduce toxic pollutants by 90 percent, reduce smog and speed the use of cleaner fuels. The president's leadership has doubled spending for real wetlands and targeted 1 million acres for a wetlands reserve through his farm bill of 1990. We have collected more civil penalties from polluters in two years than in the previous 20, begun the phaseout of substances that harm the ozone layer and launched a long-term campaign to expand and improve national parks, forests and recreation areas, adding 1.5 million acres. President Bush has dramatically increased spending for cleaning up past environmental damage caused by federal facilities. Our reforestation drive will plant 1 billion trees a year across America. Our moratorium on offshore drilling in sensitive offshore areas has bought time for technology to master environmental challenges. Our farm policies have begun a new era in sound agricultural environmentalism. Because the environment knows no boundaries, President Bush has accelerated U.S. research on global climate change, spending $2.7 billion in the last three years and requesting $1.4 billion for 1993, more than the rest of the world put together. Under his leadership, we have assisted nations from the Third World to Eastern Europe in correcting the environmental damage inflicted by socialism. We proposed a worldwide forestry convention and gave almost half a billion dollars to forest conservation. We won debt-for-nature swaps and environmental trust funds in Latin America and the Caribbean. We secured prohibitions against unilateral export or dumping of hazardous waste. We led the international ban on trade in ivory, persuaded Japan to end drift net fishing, streamlined response to oil spills and increased environmental protection for Antarctica. Adverse changes in climate must be the common concern of mankind. At the same time, we applaud our president for personally confronting the international bureaucrats at the Rio Conference. He refused to accept their anti-American demands for income redistribution and won instead a global climate treaty that relies on real action plans rather than arbitrary targets hostile to U.S. growth and workers. Following his example, a Republican Senate will not ratify any treaty that moves environmental decisions beyond our democratic process or transfers beyond our shores authority over U.S. property. The Democrats' national candidates, on the other hand, insist the United States must do what our foreign competitors refuse to do: abolish 300,000 to 1,000,000 jobs to get a modest reduction in ""greenhouse gases."" Environmental progress must continue in tandem with economic growth. Crippling an industry is no solution at all. Bankrupt facilities only worsen environmental situations. Unemployment is a form of pollution too, poisoning families and contaminating whole communities. Some in our own country still refuse to face those facts. They try to hijack environmentalism, making it anti-growth and anti-jobs. Although the average family of four now pays $1,000 a year for environmental controls, liberal Democrats want to tighten the squeeze. They use junk science to foster hysteria instead of reason, demanding rigid controls, more taxes and less resource production. However, with billions of dollars at stake in national production and jobs, not to mention our quality of life, our decisions to spend on environmental protection must not be determined by the politics of the moment. We will use scientifically respectable risk-benefit assessments to settle environmental controversies. It is time to replace knee-jerk reactions with the kind of scientific analysis that helps businesses, individuals and communities contribute to economic and environmental progress through flexible application of laws. We must base our environmental policies on real risks to human health, determined by sound, peer-reviewed science, including procedures for what is an acceptable risk. We will require federal agencies to promptly compensate, from their own budgets, for any taking of private property, including the denial of use. We will legislatively overhaul the ""superfund"" program to speed the cleanup of hazardous waste and more efficiently use superfund dollars. We will develop greenways of parks and open space in urban areas to further improve the quality of life in our cities. We will work with U.S. industry and labor to identify promising markets abroad where America's environmental know-how can carry our success story to the rest of planet earth. Private property rights. We reaffirm our commitment to the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution: ""No person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."" We support strong enforcement of this Takings Clause to keep citizens secure in the use and development of their property. The right to own, use and dispose of property inheres in mankind by nature and is a fundamental political tenet of all free nations. We applaud the wisdom of the First Congress for incorporating this guarantee of individual liberty in the Bill of Rights. We remind all government officials that property rights are not granted by government; rather, government is directed by the governed to protect the rights of private property owners. The vigilant protection of private property rights safeguards for citizens everything of value, including their right of contract to produce and sell the fruits of their labor. The historic collapse of communism and other command-and-control economies is absolute evidence of the failure of economic systems that lack a recognition of the natural rights of property owners. We also seek to reduce the amount of land owned or controlled by the government, especially in the Western states. We insist upon prompt payment for private lands certified as critical for preserving essential parks and preserves.  Uniting Our World The Triumph of Freedom The world is now our neighborhood. Its triumphs and tragedies affect our communities, our jobs and the security of our families. That is why Republicans want America to shape the international future: because we put America first. Not everyone does. Just 12 years ago, the forces of freedom were in tattered retreat. A failed foreign policy by a Democrat White House and Democrat-controlled Congress had left our allies uncertain, our friends betrayed, our foes emboldened. It was a frightening era, in some ways the worst of times. We all remember the flickering television images of blindfolded Americans being degraded by thugs. When voters make their choice in this year's elections, they should ask themselves: Are we safer and stronger today, in 1992, than we were in 1980, when Jimmy Carter was the Democrat president? Republicans are proud to answer those questions. The nation's international position has not just improved since the Democrats left office. It has been transformed. Never in this century has the United States enjoyed such security from foreign enemies. With President Bush leading the free world, the Soviet empire has collapsed, as Ronald Reagan predicted, into the dustbin of history. Eastern Europe is liberated. Germany is peacefully united. The former Soviet armies are returning home. Nuclear arsenals are being cut to fractions of their former size. A democratically elected Russian president sits in the Kremlin. Ukraine, Armenia and the Baltic States take their rightful place among the family of nations. Israel and all of its Arab neighbors talk face to face for the first time. Nicaragua and Panama celebrate democracy. It might very well not have turned out this way. Only the naive believe that history is an inevitable tide or a series of accidents. Our crusade of a half-century, to champion freedom and civilization against the dark night of totalitarianism, is now victorious. An American president led the free world to this great triumph. George Bush was that man. Freedom's victory begins a new chapter in the epic of America, full of both promise and peril. This different and unpredictable world demands visionary, experienced leadership, tested and strengthened, careful and cool. At stake is nothing less than our security, our prosperity and our children's future. Americans can trust President Bush with that awesome responsibility. The Triumph of Freedom No other president in the long history of our country has achieved so many of the enduring objectives of American foreign policy in so short a time as has George Bush. He made it look easy, even destined. It was neither. Building on the legacy of Ronald Reagan, George Bush saw the chance to sweep away decadent communism. He was the first Western leader to declare his determination to fashion ""a Europe whole and free."" He took the free world beyond containment, led the way in aiding democracy in Eastern Europe and punched holes through the rusting Iron Curtain. We all remember the joy we felt when we saw the people of Berlin dancing on top of the crumbling wall that had symbolized four decades of communist oppression. He championed Germany's right to become again one nation and orchestrated the diplomacy to make it happen, on Western terms, in one astounding year. Foreseeing revolutionary change in the Soviet Union itself, he carefully pushed its rules to open the way to the democratic future. When crisis came, in August 1991, George Bush, in the words of Boris Yeltsin, ""was the first to understand the true meaning of the victory of the Russian people"" and gave his decisive backing to the cause of democracy. The world had never before faced the disintegration of a nuclear superpower. Today, thanks in large part to President Bush's initiatives, nuclear weapons are found in only four countries of the former Soviet Union - not 14. Because of his efforts, all but Russia are giving up any claim to these weapons, and Russia has agreed to destroy the most dangerous missiles ever built. The balance of terror is fading away. The ideals of liberty, both political and economic, are the dominant moral and intellectual force around the globe. George Bush made it happen. Yet now that we have won the Cold War, we must also win the peace. We must not repeat the mistake of the past by throwing away victory through complacency. A new world beckons, unlike any we have ever known, filled with uncertainties. Old passions have re-emerged. New democracies struggle to decide their destiny. Nations are torn asunder. Migrants and refugees strain the social fabric of continents. Tyrants work to build nuclear, chemical and even biological weapons to threaten us and our neighbors. Drug trafficking and terrorism, often linked, menace Americans at home and abroad. Great transitions in world affairs are rarely tidy. They challenge statesmanship, require steadiness and wisdom. History teaches that when the United States shrinks from the world, we hasten the emergence of new dangers. Republicans remember the lesson taught by our Founders: that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. Meeting the challenge. The gulf war showed the world how much is at stake when voters choose their president. George Bush had known war firsthand. So he tried the way of peace - months of negotiations and economic sanctions - then did what a president must do. He led from powerful convictions based on American values. The United States, in a pre-eminent position of world leadership, forged a new strategy of collective engagement which invigorated the United Nations. This was not the same United States held hostage in 1980, when the Democrats controlled both the White House and the Congress. No helpless giant here. The president charted a path that wrecked Saddam Hussein's dreams of conquest and nuclear aggression while keeping America from the quagmire of indefinite military occupation of Iraq. President Bush, trusting the military commanders he had chosen, was commander-in-chief of one of the finest achievements in the distinguished history of our armed forces. Americans will never forget that, of the 323 congressional Democrats, only 96 voted to support Operation Desert Storm and 227 voted to oppose it. If the Democrats had prevailed, Saddam Hussein would still be in Kuwait, armed with nuclear weapons. Everyone discovered what difference a vote for president can make. Leadership through partnership. A new era demands a new agenda. Our post-Cold War strategy both reflects our country's ideals and guards its interests. Building a commonwealth of freedom differs greatly from the old concept of containment. It rests on a stable balance of power but goes beyond it to emphasize, above all, the supremacy of an idea: a common conception of how to make freedom work for all the nations moving with us into a radically changing future. Republicans understand that objective cannot be pursued by the United States alone. We therefore have harnessed the free world's strength to American leadership. But such a strategy requires a president whose lead others will trust and follow. By forging consensus whenever possible, we multiply the impact of our nation's power and principles. But if necessary we will act alone to protect American interests. Consistent with our policy and traditions, we oppose any actions that would undermine America's sovereignty, either in political or economic terms. Leadership through partnership allows us to project American ideals and project American interests abroad, at less cost to our taxpayers. That is how we will secure the victory of democracy as the best guarantee of a world without war. It is how we will open the world for American business to ensure prosperity in an open international economy. And it is how we will banish the nuclear nightmare, limit the danger from weapons of mass destruction and safely manage a critical transition in our nation's defenses. Securing the victory of democracy. The spread of democracy and economic liberty is the best guarantee of peace. It can mean speaking out or applying economic pressure to encourage peaceful change; aiding democratic forces; or being ready, as a last resort, to take military action where vital American interests are at stake, as when President Bush restored the rule of law to Panama. Republican presidents have used all these tools in a comprehensive, consistent campaign to promote democracy worldwide. New tests lie ahead. On past occasions, the tide of liberty has ebbed as dictators recaptured much of what they had lost. We want freedom's wave to roll on to reach countries like China, Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam and others. We want to keep drawing attention to serious human rights violations around the world, spurring other governments to make and fulfill the promise of liberty to their people. We want to prevent any new ideology of authoritarianism from drawing any of the world's people to a grim and vengeful vision of our future. This is the challenge we face in the next four years. It is why President Bush led the way in promoting assistance to the fledgling democracies of Eastern Europe. It is why he has persuaded Congress to invest in the democratic future of nations reborn from communism. To the peoples of those nations, and to the Russian people in particular, we declare: If you stay on the path to freedom, we stand ready to help. We rejoice especially with the people of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, whose nationhood we have always upheld in law and in our hearts. In Western Europe, we reaffirm the NATO alliance. While we reduce our troop commitments on the continent - a thousand soldiers are coming home every week - we must keep a powerful force deployed there. The United States must remain a European power in the broadest sense, able to influence the policies and events that affect the livelihood and security of future generations of Americans. The violence in what used to be Yugoslavia is an affront to humanity. We condemn those responsible for the carnage there and call for an immediate international investigation of atrocities. We support the United Nations peacekeeping effort and urge an immediate cease-fire by all parties. The United States should continue to demand respect for international law and fundamental human rights in this agonizing conflict. We encourage a peaceful settlement for Cyprus and respect by all parties for the wishes of the Cypriot people. We urge peace and justice for Northern Ireland. We welcome the newly begun process of constitutional dialogue that holds so much promise. We encourage investment and reconstruction to create opportunity for all. In the Middle East, prospects for peace have been transformed by the determined statesmanship of George Bush. Without the leadership of President Bush, Iraq would today threaten world peace, the peace and security of the Middle East, and the very survival of Israel with a huge conventional army and nuclear weapons. Direct peace talks, on terms Israel rightly had sought for more than four decades, would not be a reality. Soviet Jewish emigration likely would have been interrupted. The rescue of Ethiopian Jewry might not have happened. And the equation of Zionism to racism still would be a grotesque stain on the United Nations. Although much has changed for the better, the Middle East remains an area of high tensions - many unrelated to the ArabIsraeli conflict - where regional conflicts can escalate to threaten the vital interests of the United States. As Saddam Hussein's aggression against Kuwait demonstrated, heavily armed radical regimes are capable of independent aggressive action. In this environment, Israel's demonstrated strategic importance to the United States, as our most reliable and capable ally in this part of the world, is more important than ever. This strategic relationship, with its unique moral dimension, explains the understandable support Israel receives from millions of Americans who participate in our political process. The strong ties between the United States and Israel were demonstrated during the gulf war when Israel chose not to retaliate against repeated missile attacks, even though they caused severe damage and loss of life. We will continue to broaden and deepen the strategic relationship with our ally Israel - the only true democracy in the Middle East - by taking additional concrete steps to further institutionalize the partnership. This will include maintaining adequate levels of security and economic assistance; continuing our meetings on military, political and economic cooperation and coordination; pre-positioning military equipment; developing joint contingency plans; and increasing joint naval and air exercises. Consistent with our strategic relationship, the United States should continue to provide large-scale security assistance to Israel, maintaining Israel's qualitative military advantage over any adversary or coalition of adversaries. We also will continue to negotiate with the major arms supplying nations to reach an agreement on limiting arms sales to the Middle East and preventing the proliferation of non-conventional weapons. We applaud the president's leadership in fostering unprecedented direct talks between Israel and its Arab neighbors. The United States is prepared to use its good offices to mediate disputes at their request. We do not believe the United States should attempt to impose a solution on the parties. The basis for negotiations must be U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. Peace must come from direct negotiations. It will be up to the negotiators to determine exactly what is required to satisfy these resolutions, but we firmly believe Israel has a right to exist in secure and recognized borders. As President Bush stated in Madrid, our objective is not simply to end the state of war; rather, it is to establish real peace, one with treaties, security, diplomatic relations, trade, investment, cultural exchange, even tourism. We want the Middle East to become a place where people lead normal lives. A meaningful peace must assure Israel's security while recognizing the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. We oppose the creation of an independent Palestinian state. Nor will we support the creation of any political entity that would jeopardize Israel's security. As Israelis and Palestinians negotiate interim selfgovernment, no party will be required to commit itself to any specific final outcome of direct negotiations. Israel should not be forced to negotiate with any party. In this regard, the United States will have no dialogue with the PLO until it satisfies in full the conditions laid out by President Bush in 1990. We believe Jerusalem should remain an undivided city, with free and unimpeded access to all holy places by people of all faiths. No genuine peace would deny Jews the right to live anywhere in the special city of Jerusalem. Peace in the Middle East entails cooperation among all the parties in the region. To this end, we have worked to bring all of the states of the area together with Israel to hold multilateral negotiations on issues of common concern such as regional development, water, refugees, arms control and the environment. We support these forums as a means of encouraging Arab acceptance of Israel and solving common regional problems. We continue to back legislation mandating that if the United Nations and its agencies were to deny Israel's right to participate, the United States would withhold financial support and withdraw from those bodies until their action was rectified. Republicans believe freedom of emigration is a fundamental human right and that Jews from any nation should be free to travel to Israel. Republicans are proud that we have maintained our historic and moral commitment to the resettlement in Israel of persecuted Jews. We congratulate President Bush and Secretary (of State James A.) Baker (III) on the agreement with Israel for a generous package of loan guarantees that will provide new immigrants with needed humanitarian assistance. We also should maintain our close ties with and generous aid for Egypt, which properly reaps the benefits of its courageous peace with Israel. We continue to support Egypt and other proWestern states in the region against subversion and aggression and call for an end to the Arab boycott of Israel. We also support establishment of a strong central government in Lebanon, democratically elected and representative of its citizens. We salute all the countries in the Middle East who contributed to the success of Desert Storm and share our goal of stability in the region. With them, we hope to build upon that triumph a new future for the Middle East, founded on mutual respect and a common longing for peace. To promote this goal, we should settle for nothing less than full, unconditional, immediate and verified Iraqi compliance with all aspects of the cease-fire laid out in U.N. resolutions. In the Western Hemisphere, as elsewhere, we must promote democratic values. We will continue to seek cooperation in the common battle against the drug lords. We will also lower barriers to trade and investment, knowing that our exports to Latin America are helping to lead our economic recovery at home. The president's Enterprise for the Americas initiative and the North American Free Trade Agreement mean, for the United States, billions of dollars in new trade, hundreds of thousands of new jobs, and a long-term solution to the economic pressures behind illegal immigration. We welcome positive changes, economic and political, in Mexico and salute the people of Panama on their recovery of free institutions after Operation Just Cause. We commend President Bush for the decisive military action that led to the end of the corrupt (Manuel Antonio) Noriega regime and freedom for democratically minded Panamanians. We will uphold free and unencumbered U.S. access to the canal. We hail the patriots of El Salvador and Nicaragua, whose bravery and blood thwarted communism and Castro despite the inconstancy of congressional Democrats. Together with other members of the Organization of American States, we will work to restore democracy to Haiti. The Monroe Doctrine remains a cardinal principle of our foreign policy, and we continue to strive toward the day when the alien ideology of communism and Fidel Castro's regime will be purged from Cuba, and Americans can welcome Cuban people back into the family of free nations. Toward that end, we support Radio and TV Marti and the spirit of Cuba Libre. In Asia, we remain committed to the spread of political and economic liberty. We will work with Japan for common progress and maintain military presence in Japan and in Asia. We also will promote greater Japanese responsibility for self-defense and worldwide prosperity. We reaffirm our commitment to the security of Taiwan and regard any attempt to alter its status by force as a threat to the entire region. We adhere to the Taiwan Relations Act, the basis for continuing cooperation with those who have stood loyally with us for half a century. Our policy toward China is based on support for democratic reform. We need to maintain the relationship with China so that we can effectively encourage such reform. We will continue to work toward the day when the Chinese people will finally complete their journey to an open society, free of the deplorable restrictions on personal liberties that still exist. We will maintain our close relationship with the Republic of Korea, helping to deter aggression from the north. North Korea remains an outlaw state and must not be permitted to acquire nuclear weapons. With the people of the Philippines, we will maintain our special ties of history and affection. We support the movement in Cambodia toward peace and democracy. We demand the fullest possible accounting for America's POWs and MIAs in Southeast Asia. The grief of their families touches all of us. We will seek complete information in all forums and from all sources. Our president has put the government of Vietnam on notice: Improved relations depends upon this goal. In Africa, despite opposition from congressional Democrats, we armed freedom fighters and helped force the withdrawal of Cuban troops. Now we enter the long season of building, trying to revive faith in democracy on a continent ravaged by Marxist wars, looted by local dictators and misled by socialist ideology. Political and economic liberty are the keys. We will support responsible efforts by the international community to help end the anarchy in Somalia and to address the plight of the people of that country suffering from drought and starvation. We condemn those who are using armed force to impede food distribution. In South Africa, the Republican policy of constructive engagement - opposing apartheid while fostering peaceful change - has been successful. That nation's prospects have been transformed for the better, though many difficulties lie ahead. We condemn all violence against the innocent and applaud those who seek reconciliation to create a new, democratic South Africa. We encourage economic reform as crucial to both security and prosperity in the new South Africa. We recognize that foreign aid must have a reasonable relationship to our national interests. We therefore support an ongoing review of such programs so that they can be both effectual and justified. We promote financial contribution from other democracies of the world to share the cost of the American burden for peacekeeping and foreign aid. We support efforts by private voluntary agencies to help meet the needs of countries newly liberated from communism and of the developing world in such areas as medical, agricultural, educational and entrepreneurial assistance. Opening the world to American business. The triumph of democracy is also a victory for economic freedom. All the world over, people in search of a better life are rejecting politicians' control of their future. This will mean a broader horizon for American opportunity. The whole world has become our marketplace. The election of 1992 will determine whether our country seizes this tremendous opportunity or retreats from it. Republicans trust individuals and families to make their own economic decisions; Democrat politicians do not. We reject their program of strangled trade, industrial policy, high taxes and regulation. We reject punitive taxes on foreign businesses in this country that only invite retaliatory taxes against U.S. businesses abroad. Trade war is the road to international depression - and for keeping American workers dependent on government handouts. We do not want to replace the arms race with a subsidies race. Putting Americans first means keeping the national interest ahead of the special interests. It means opening the world to American goods within a system of free and expanding trade. Just as Ronald Reagan declared in Berlin, ""Tear down this wall,"" so George Bush is dismantling the walls of protectionism in order to continue expanding our exports. Our strong commitment to free trade also encompasses vigorous enforcement of U.S. trade laws. We expect a fair and level playing field in our trade with other nations and will work to ensure that foreign markets are just as open to our goods as U.S. markets are to theirs. In all negotiations concerning trade, we will put the interests of America first. Throughout the world, as here at home, the Republican Party stands for growth. America's families have nothing to fear - and everything to gain - from the new era of free enterprise and prosperity that will emerge as free people compete, excel and progress. Banishing the nuclear nightmare. The world has moved from the brink of disaster to the threshold of historic opportunity. For almost half a century, we lived under the shadow of nuclear destruction. Today, that specter is fading. We will not stop here. We will banish the threat of nuclear annihilation from the face of the earth - not by savaging our military, as some Democrats might insist but by building on the historic diplomatic achievements of Presidents Bush and Reagan. This means ensuring stable command and control of the former Soviet arsenal, complete acceptance and verified implementation of all treaty obligations by the successor states to the Soviet Union, and achieving the additional 50 percent reduction in strategic forces now agreed upon. We must assist in dismantling weapons, transforming the massive Soviet war machine into an engine of peace and civilian revival. We will cooperate with our former adversaries both to curtail proliferation and to move beyond the ABM Treaty toward effective ballistic missile defenses. We will not permit the Soviet nuclear nightmare to be replaced by another one. Outlaw nations - North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Libya and others - lust for weapons of mass destruction. This is the nightmare of proliferation: nuclear, chemical and biological weapons that, together with ballistic missiles, can deliver death across whole continents, including our own. We will renew and strengthen the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. We will design security policies to counter proliferation dangers. We will reinforce multilateral accords like the Missile Technology Control Regime. And most important, we will develop and deploy global defenses against ballistic missiles. Despite the opposition of the Democratic Party and congressional Democrats, we will deploy an effective strategic defense system for the American people. America's Security Because America won the Cold War, our homes and neighborhoods are more secure then they have been for half a century. Our children are safer. The greatest peace dividend is peace itself. For it, we thank God. Victory was never inevitable. It was won in blood and treasure, over five decades, by the American people - from the military on the front lines to the taxpayers sustaining the forces of freedom. It was also secured, and the course of mankind profoundly changed for the better, because two successive Republican presidents, Ronald Reagan and George Bush, were dedicated to peace through strength. ""Peace through strength"" was more than a slogan. It was the calculated Republican plan for, first, the survival, and then the triumph, of America. But freedom did not come cheaply, and the new world we celebrate today required great sacrifice. In 1981 we inherited from Jimmy Carter and anti-defense Democrats a crippled military: demoralized, underfunded, illequipped. Republicans told the truth to the American people; they heeded our call to arms. We restored our armed forces to their proper place in both the budget and the pride of the nation. Our men and women in uniform today are the equals of the finest soldiers, sailors and airmen who ever wore the uniform of our country. Like earlier generations in 1918 and 1945, they won a great victory. Now, as in the aftermath of those earlier conflicts, comes the difficult task of reducing both the size and cost of defense without letting down America's guard. In the past, terrible mistakes were made, and we paid dearly for them when war came to Korea. We will not allow that to happen again. America challenged. The greatest danger to America's security is here at home, among those who would leave the nation unprepared for the new realities of the post Cold War world. The ruthless demagogues in rogue regimes are real and so are the nuclear, chemical and biological weapons they seek. The danger of nuclear proliferation is real, especially with the dispersal of nuclear know-how after the collapse of the Soviet Union. That is why the Republican Party, whose leaders, such as Dan Quayle, insisted upon fielding a new Patriot missile in the 1980s, now calls for a new generation of defense against the Scuds of tomorrow. Rather than admit their mistakes of the past, the same liberal Democrats who sought to disarm America against the Soviet threat now compound their errors with a new campaign half audacity, half mendacity - to leave the nation unprotected in a still dangerous world. Republicans call for a controlled defense drawdown, not a free fall. That is why President Bush proposes to carefully reduce defense spending over the next four years by an additional $34 billion, including $18 billion in outlays, with a 25 percent reduction in personnel. He has already eliminated over 100 weapon systems. Around the world, American forces are coming home from the frontiers of the Cold War. More than 550 overseas bases are being closed or realigned. Yet U.S. forces retain the ability to meet the challenge of another Desert Storm with equal success. U.S. defense spending already has been reduced significantly. Five years ago, it was more than a quarter of the federal budget. By 1997 it will be less than a sixth. Spending on defense and intelligence, as a proportion of gross domestic product, will be the lowest it has been since before World War II. Yet any defense budget, however lean, is still too much for the Democrats. They want to start by cutting defense outlays over the next four years by nearly $60 billion beyond the president's cuts, throwing as many as 1 million additional Americans out of work. And this may be just the beginning, as the Democrats use the defense budget as a bottomless piggy bank to try to beat swords into pork barrels. This is folly. It would take us back to the hollow military of the Carter era. Once American defenses are allowed to decay, they cannot be rebuilt overnight. Effective arsenals, like effective leaders, require years of patient development. And our greatest asset of all, the people on whom our security depends, deserve a constant long-term investment in their quality, morale and safety. Republicans pledge to provide it. America secure. Because the United States will rely on a smaller force of offensive nuclear weapons to deter aggression in the post-Cold War era, we will maintain the triad of land, sea, and air-based strategic forces. We will continue to test the safety, reliability and effectiveness of our nuclear weapons. With a smaller military, modernization of conventional forces is more important than ever. Desert Storm showed the importance of ""force multipliers"" like smart munitions, stealth technology and night-fighting capabilities. We will upgrade existing weapons and selectively procure those that hold the promise of dramatic forward leaps in capability. Under no circumstances will we yield our technological superiority. We must remain ready to defend American citizens and interests wherever they may be threatened. Essential to that readiness is maintenance of a strong global navy and modernization of vital airlift and sealift capacity. We remain committed to combating terrorism in all its forms wherever it threatens U.S. citizens or interests. Republicans will preserve the nation's access to space for defense, as well as for other purposes, and ensure that space technology does not fall into dangerous hands. Transformed by the collapse of communism, our Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) is now designed to provide the United States and our allies with global defenses against limited ballistic missile attacks. SDI is the greatest investment in peace we could ever make. This system will be our shield against technoterrorism. Russia has agreed to be our partner in it, sharing early warning information and jointly moving forward to stop those who would rain death upon the innocent. We will use missile defenses to assure threatened nations that they do not need to acquire ballistic missiles of their own. We will move beyond the ABM Treaty to deploy effective defenses with the goal of someday eliminating, not merely reducing, the threat of nuclear holocaust. We support efforts to reduce armaments, both conventional and otherwise, but the most effective arms control of all over the long run is democracy. Free nations do not attack one another. That is why the promotion of democracy on every continent is an essential part of the Republican defense agenda. Managing the peace. A new era in defense requires new approaches to management, to get more out of every dollar in a shrinking budget. That calls for dramatically different ways of doing business. For example, President Bush's reforms in defense management and acquisition already mean massive savings - $70 billion through 1997 - without sacrificing combat capability. Our armed forces will still depend on our superb industrial base for everything from belt buckles to submarines. We cannot lose that engineering and manufacturing capability. This is especially true of the high technology, demonstrated in Desert Storm, that made our enemies realize they had been left behind in the race for the future. We therefore pledge to maintain America's technological lead, preserve its defense industrial base, and maintain robust levels of investment in research and development. We will attack the problem of waste in the military, especially at its root in the pork barrel politics of Capitol Hill. A Republican Congress will end the costly micromanagement of defense programs and reduce the number and scope of oversight committees. We will urge the Department of Defense to encourage a broader constituency for saving and to continue genuine procurement reforms based on performance rather than unreasonable regulations imposed by the Democrat Congress. We will continue the successful effort to eliminate redundancy and streamline all facets of defense management. We applaud the president's efforts to assist all individuals and communities adversely affected by the ongoing defense builddown, with more than 30 defense adjustment programs already in place and more than $7 billion committed to the effort in just the next two years. The men and women of defense. Republicans created the allvolunteer Army, and we hail its success. We pledge to keep faith with the men and women volunteers and with their families, for they are the backbone of the nation's defense. We oppose Democrat efforts to bring back the draft, whether directly or through the subterfuge of compulsory domestic service. The armed forces are a colorblind meritocracy, a model for the rest of our society. Its enlistees should receive preference in federal education and retraining programs. We applaud the advancement of women in the military and single out for special recognition the outstanding contribution of women in Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm. However, we oppose liberal Democrat attempts to place women in combat positions just to make an ideological point. Unlike the Democratic Party and its candidate, we support the continued exclusion of homosexuals from the military as a matter of good order and discipline. The Department of Defense will not be an exception to our assertion of family values. Republicans will not tolerate sexual harassment or misconduct toward any individual in the ranks. We demand both its prevention and its punishment. To drive home that point, we urge a halt to the sale, in military facilities, of sexually explicit materials. We call for greater consideration of the needs of families when parents are called to duty. We must ensure that all of the various benefits, including medical, that were promised to the men and women who chose to make the military and the defense of their nation a career are fulfilled even upon retirement. In the Republican tradition of support for America's veterans, we proposed and created a Department of Veterans Affairs so their concerns would be represented at the Cabinet table. We affirm our support for veterans preference in federal employment and for sufficient funding to maintain the integrity of the veterans hospital and medical-care system. We strongly endorse programs to meet the needs of unemployed veterans. Intelligence. Desert Storm reminded us that our intelligence community is a national asset of critical importance to our security. Assuring the availability of timely and reliable information on regional threats and unrest, drug trafficking, terrorism, technology transfer, proliferation and a host of other issues this is one of our highest national priorities in the post-Cold War world. U.S. policy-makers also must have the best possible understanding of international trade, investment, industrial, financial and other developments that affect our economic security. We must and will maintain the full range of our traditional intelligence capabilities, including covert action, to ensure our security in a dangerous and unpredictable world. We reject the Democrat candidate's proposal to cripple U.S. intelligence and decry the deep spending cuts to the intelligence budget sponsored by Democrats in Congress. Proven leadership. George Bush has been the most important architect of Western aspirations and designs for the challenging world we are now entering. His record is clear. President Bush has shown he understands how to lead in this new era, where the pre-eminent position of the United States offers new opportunities to build an international consensus on key issues. President Bush, with experienced Republican leadership, has proved he knows how to place our nation at the center of effective coalitions where our power is multiplied. The test of international leadership is on the field, not in a playbook. The Oval Office is no place for on-the-job training - not in carrying out the presidential duty to protect and defend our nation, not in managing the arsenal of the supreme nuclear power. There are those who talk and those who perform. George Bush has clearly performed for America, making the right calls in a series of tough decisions that helped transform the world. Now that we have won the Cold War, we must secure the peace that follows. History has shown that the years following conflict are often critical - where the choices made can either lay the foundation for lasting peace or sow the seeds of the future war. In this period of high hopes and great challenges ahead, the nation needs the tested and experienced leadership of President Bush and the Republican Party.",183804,28647,"preamble abraham lincoln, our first republican president, expressed the philosophy that inspires republicans to this day: ""the legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done, but cannot do at all, or cannot so well do, for themselves in their separate and individual capacities. but in all that people can individually do as well for themselves, government ought not to interfere."" we believe that most problems of human making are within the capacity of human ingenuity to solve. for good reason, millions of new americans have flocked to our shores: america has always been an opportunity society. republicans have always believed that economic prosperity comes from individual enterprise, not government programs. we have defended our core principles for years. but never has this country, and the world, been so receptive to our message. the fall of the berlin wall symbolizes an epochal change in the way people live. more important, it liberates the way people think. we see with new clarity that centralized government bureaucracies created in this century are not the wave of the future. never again will people trust planners and paper shufflers more than they trust themselves. we all watched as the statue of soviet hangman feliks dzherzhinsky was toppled in front of moscow's kgb headquarters by the very people his evil empire sought to enslave. its sightless eyes symbolized the moral blindness of totalitarians around the world. they could never see the indomitable spirit of people determined to be free from government control - free to build a better future with their own heads, hands and hearts. we republicans saw clearly the dangers of collectivism: not only the military threat but the deeper threat to the souls of people bound in dependence. here at home, we warned against ""big government,"" because we knew concentrated decision-making, no matter how well-intentioned, was a danger to liberty and prosperity. republicans stood at the rampart of freedom, defending the individual against the domineering state. while we did not always prevail, we always stood our ground, faithful to our principles and confident of history's ultimate verdict. our opponents declared that the dogmas of the left were the final and victorious faith. from kremlins and ivory towers, their planners proclaimed the bureaucratic millennium. but in a tragic century of illusion, five-year plans and great leaps forward failed to summon a brave new world. one hundred and fifty years of slogans and manifestos came crashing down in an ironic cascade of unintended consequences. all that is left are the ruins of a failed scoundrel ideology. as may day lapses back into just another spring festival, the fourth of july emerges as the common holiday of free men and women. yet, in , when the self-governing individual has overcome the paternalistic state, liberals here at home simply do not get it. indeed, their party seeks to turn the clock back. but their ideas are old and tired. like planets still orbiting a dying star, the believers in state power turn their faces to a distant and diminishing light. the democrats would revise history to rationalize a return to bigger government, higher taxes and moral relativism. the democratic party has forgotten its origins as a party of work, thrift and self-reliance. but they have not forgotten their art for dissembling and distortion. the democrats are trapped in their compact with the ideology of trickle-down government, but they are clever enough to know that the voters would shun them if their true markings were revealed. america had its rendezvous with destiny in . faced with crisis at home and abroad, americans turned to republican leadership in the white house. presidents reagan and bush turned our nation away from the path of overtaxation, hyper-regulation and megagovernment. instead, we moved in a new direction. we cut taxes, reduced red tape, put people above bureaucracy. and so we vanquished the idea of the almighty state as the supervisor of our daily lives. in choosing hope over fear, americans raised a beacon, reminding the world that we are a shining city on a hill, the last best hope for man on earth. contrary to statist democrat propaganda, the american people know that the 1980s were a rising tide, a magnificent decade for freedom and entrepreneurial creativity. we are confident that, knowing this, they will never consciously retreat to the bad old days of tax and spend. our platform will clarify the choice before our fellow citizens. we have learned that ideas do indeed have consequences. thus, our words are important not for their prose but for what they reveal about the thinking of our president and our party. two years ago, president bush described the key elements of what he called ""our new paradigm,"" a fresh approach that aims to put new ideas to work in the service of enduring principles principles we upheld throughout the long twilight struggle, principles george bush has acted decisively to advance. thus we honor the founders and their vision. unlike our opponents, we are inspired by a commitment to profound change. our mission combines timeless beliefs with a positive vision of a vigorous america: prosperous and tolerant, just and compassionate. we believe that individual freedom, hard work and personal responsibility - basic to free society - are also basic to effective government. we believe in the fundamental goodness of the american people. we believe in traditional family values and in the judeo-christian heritage that informs our culture. we believe in the constitution and its guarantee of color-blind equal opportunity. we believe in free markets. we believe in constructive change, in both true conservatism and true reform. we believe government has a legitimate role to play in our national life, but government must never dominate that life. while our goals are constant, we are willing to innovate, experiment and learn. we have learned that bigger is not better, that quantity and quality are different things, that more money does not guarantee better outcomes. we have learned the importance of individual choice - in education, health care, child care - and that bureaucracy is the enemy of initiative and self reliance. we believe in empowerment, including home ownership for as many as possible. we believe in decentralized authority, and a bottom line, principled commitment to what works for people. we believe in the american people: free men and women with faith in god, working for themselves and their families, believing in the value of every human being from the very young to the very old. we believe the founders intended congress to be responsive, flexible and foresighted. after decades of democrat misrule, the congress is none of these things. dominated by reactionaries, obsessed with the failed policies and structures of the past, the democrat majority displays a ""do nothing"" doggedness: they intend to learn nothing and forget nothing. seeking to build a better america, we seek to elect a better congress. finally, we believe in a president who represents the national interest, not just the aggregation of well-connected special interests - a president who brings unity to the american purpose. america faces many challenges. republicans, under the strong leadership of president bush, are responding with this bold platform of new ideas that infuses our commitment to individual freedom and market forces with an equal commitment to a decent, just way of life for every american. with a firm faith that the american people will always choose hope over fear, we republicans dedicate ourselves to this forward-looking agenda for america in the 1990s, transcending old, static ideas with a shared vision of hope, optimism and opportunity. uniting our family family: the home of freedom as the family goes, so goes the nation. strong families and strong communities make a strong america. an old adage says, ""america is great because she is good; if america ceases to be good, she will cease to be great."" our greatness starts at home - literally. so republicans believe government should strengthen families, not replace them. today, more than ever, the traditional family is under assault. we believe our laws should reflect what makes our nation prosperous and wholesome: faith in god, hard work, service to others and limited government. parents bring reality to these principles when they pass them on to their children. as the book of proverbs proclaims, ""train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it."" imagine the america we could create if all parents taught their children the importance of honesty, work, responsibility and respect for others. we would have less violence in our homes and streets; less illegal drug use; fewer teen pregnancies forcing girls and boys to be adults before they have graduated from high school. instead, we would have an america of families, friends and communities that care about one another. that kind of future is not a matter of chance; it is a question of personal responsibility. barbara bush captured the importance of that stewardship when she said, ""at the end of your life you will never regret not having passed one more test, not winning one more verdict, or not closing one more deal. you will regret time not spent with a husband, a child, a friend or a parent."" the republican party has espoused these principles since its founding. families built on solid, spiritual foundations are central to our party's inspiration. at this time of great national and global transition, we renew our commitment to these fundamental principles, which will guide our family, our country, our world into the next century. family: the home of freedom the rights of the family. our national renewal starts with the family. it is where each new generation gains its moral anchor. it is the school of citizenship, the engine of economic progress, a permanent haven when everything is changing. change can be good, when it liberates the energy and commitment of family members to build better futures. we welcome change that corrects the mistakes of the past, particularly those at war against the family. for more than three decades, the liberal philosophy has assaulted the family on every side. today, its more vocal advocates believe children should be able to sue their parents over decisions about schooling, cosmetic surgery, employment and other family matters. they deny parental authority and responsibility, fracturing the family into isolated individuals, each of them dependent upon - and helpless before - government. this is the ultimate agenda of contemporary socialism under all its masks: to liberate youth from traditional family values by replacing family functions with bureaucratic social services. that is why today's liberal democrats are hostile toward any institution government cannot control, like private child care or religious schools. the republican party responds, as it has since , with an unabashed commitment to the family's economic liberty and moral rights. republicans trust parents and believe they, not courts and lawyers, know what is best for their children. that is why we will work to ensure that the congress and the states shall enact no law abridging the rights of the family formed by blood, marriage, adoption or legal custody - rights that are anterior and superior to those of government. republicans oppose and resist the efforts of the democratic party to redefine the traditional american family. the right to a family. every child deserves a family in a home filled with love and free from abuse. today, many children do not enjoy that right. we are determined to change that. while government cannot legislate love and compassion, we can provide the leadership to encourage the development of healthy, nurturing families. we applaud the fine example of family values and family virtue as lived by the president and the first lady. we will promote whole, caring families by eliminating biases that have crept into our legal and tax codes. we will advance adoption through significant tax credits, insurance reforms and legal reforms. we encourage adoption for those unprepared or unwilling to bear the emotional, financial or physical demands of raising a child, and will work to revive maternity homes to ensure care for both mothers and babies. we applaud the commitment of foster-care parents who provide family environments for foster-care children. we abhor the disgraceful bureaucratic mismanagement of foster care. big-city mayors have spent billions on social service bureaucrats who have lost track of many children. many have no health records, no real residence, not even the simplest personal possessions. shuttled from house to house, they lack discipline and identity, and are ripe for lives of crime. we are determined to reform this system to help these children. broken homes can have a devastating emotional and economic impact upon children and are the breeding ground for gang members. we urge state legislatures to explore ways to promote marital stability. because the intergenerational family is a vital element of social cohesion, we urge greater respect for the rights and roles of grandparents. republicans recognize the importance of having fathers and mothers in the home. the two-parent family still provides the best environment of stability, discipline, responsibility and character. documentation shows that where the father has deserted his family, children are more likely to commit a crime, to drop out of school, to become violent, to become teen parents, to take illegal drugs, to become mired in poverty, or to have emotional or behavioral problems. we support the courageous efforts of single-parent families to have a stable home. caring for children. george bush secured the american family's most important victory of the last four years: his child-care bill. he won landmark legislation - a voucher system for low-income households, allowing parents to choose what's best for their children, including care given by neighbors or churches. the democratic party opposed that legislation and instead sought government control of child care and fewer choices for parents. the president also advanced equity for families that forgo a second income to care for their children at home through his young child tax credit. congressional democrats are already trying to repeal it. the demands of employment and commuting often make it hard for parents to spend time with their children. republicans advocate maximum flexibility in working and child-care arrangements so that families can make the most of their schedules. we support pro-family policies: job sharing, telecommuting, compressed workweeks, parental leave negotiated between employer and employees, and flextime. we reject the democrats' one-size-fits-all approach that puts mandates on employers and takes choices away from employees. most parents prefer in-home care of their children but often encounter government obstacles. republicans will promote in-home care by allowing payment annually, instead of quarterly, of income taxes by employees and withholding taxes by employers. our proposals for tort reform, now blocked by the democrat congress, will prevent excessive litigation that hampers the growth of child-care opportunities. by taking care of our children, we are taking care of our future. family security. over the last several decades, liberal democrats have increasingly shifted economic burdens onto the american family. indeed, the liberal democrat tax-and-spend policies have forced millions of women into the workplace just to make ends meet. because of their policies in congress, fathers and mothers have a tougher time bringing home what they work so hard for. between and , under the democrat-controlled congress for most of those years, federal taxes on the average family of four rose from percent to percent of income. when state and local levies are included, the tax burden exceeds onethird of family income. the increase in the effective federal tax rate since has now swallowed up an ever increasing share of a family's earnings. instead of working to improve their family's standard of living, they must work to feed government's gluttonous appetite. this is a scandal. in the 1980s, two republican presidents kept democrats from making matters worse. presidents reagan and bush led the way to increase the personal exemption for dependents. we pledge to go farther to restore the value, as a percentage of average household income, it had years ago. the value of the dependent deduction has eroded to a fraction of its original worth to families. republicans call for a complete restoration, in real dollars, to its original value. rather than fatten government bureaucracies with new programs to ""help"" families, we want to expand the young child tax credit to $ per child and make it available to all families with children under the age of . when the democrats establish tax policy that makes marriage more expensive than living together, they discourage traditional commitment and stable home life. we will remove the marriage penalty in the tax code, so a married couple will receive as large a standard deduction as their unmarried counterparts. together, these changes will empower parents to care for their families in a way public services never can. achieving educational excellence. in the earliest american communities, pioneers would establish a church, then a school. parents wanted their children to have the best possible education, to learn what they needed to know to make a better life. virtually every newly arrived immigrant family thought of education as the american way from the back to the front of the line. americans have come to believe that only a country that successfully educates its sons and daughters can count on a strong, competitive economy, a vibrant culture and a solid civic life. as a result of this popular demand for education, americans have created the most extensive and widely accessible educational system in the world. the people have insisted that primary responsibility for education properly remain with families, communities and states, although, from early times, the national government has played a role in encouraging innovation and access. in the 18th century, the northwest ordinance assured that school bells would ring amid frontier forests. in the 19th century, president lincoln signed the morrill act establishing land grant colleges. in the 20th century, president eisenhower signed the national defense education act, providing millions with a chance at higher education; and president nixon signed legislation that today provides federal grants and loans to half our full-time college students. in the 21st century, the promotion of educational excellence will be more crucial than ever before in our nation's history. recognizing what every parent knows, that our current educational system is not educating our children, president bush is leading an educational revolution. we applaud the president's bold vision to change radically our education system. our parents want it, our communities want it, our states want it, and our children want it - but the democrat leadership in the house and senate continue to thwart the will of the american people for radical change in the way we educate our children. the republican strategy is based on sound principle. parents have the right to choose the best school for their children. schools should teach right from wrong. schools should reinforce parental authority, not replace it. we should increase flexibility from federal regulation. we should explore a new generation of break-the-mold new american schools. standards and assessments should be raised, not reduced to a lowest common denominator. communities should be empowered to find what works. the pursuit of excellence in education is a fundamental goal. good teachers should be rewarded for teaching well. alternative certification can bring desperately needed new people into the teaching profession. america needs public, private and parochial schools. education is a joint responsibility of the individual, the family and the community. parents are the first and most important teachers of their children. they should have the right not only to participate in their child's education but to choose for their children among the broadest array of educational choices, without regard to their income. we also support the right of parents to provide quality education through home-based schools. the bush administration has sent to congress several legislative proposals embodying these principles. the proposals, in spite of the fact that , communities across the nation have developed local committees to support them through the america strategy, languish in the democrat congress. and they are opposed by special-interest unions that have a power grip on the failed policies of the past. improving america by improving our schools. for america to maintain her pre-eminence into the next century, our educational system must be revolutionized. too many schools still teach in an outdated manner. too many government and union rules have burdened our schools. and too much influence by lobbyists has blocked true reform. even the most inspiring teachers are working within a system that stymies their creativity and fails to challenge their students. creating the best schools in the world. we applaud president bush's consistent and determined leadership in setting a new direction for american education. our overriding purpose is clear: to create the best schools in the world for our children by the turn of the century. to do so, the president has established a bold strategy, america , which challenges communities in every state to take charge to achieve our ambitious national education goals. the success of america will depend upon the local community, where implementation and ultimate responsibility rest. we have seen real progress. perhaps most important, though, is that president bush has fostered a national debate on education that has challenged every american to get involved. he has called forth american traits of ingenuity and ambition to create better lives for our children. as a result, a new generation of break-the-mold new american schools is taking shape. new and tougher standards and assessments are being established for what our children should know. the number of strings attached to federal school aid is being reduced. the president has shown unprecedented leadership for the most important education goal of all: helping middle- and lowincome families enjoy the same choice of schools - public, private or religious - that families with more resources already have. the president's proposed ""gi bill for children"" will provide $, scholarships to middle- and low-income families, enabling their children to attend the school of their choice. this innovative plan will not only drive schools to excel as they compete, but will also give every parent consumer power to obtain an excellent education for his or her child. republican leadership has nearly doubled funds for head start, making it possible, for the first time, for all eligible -year-olds to participate, should their parents choose to enroll them. the bush administration has put a college education within reach of millions more students, young and old. the president has proposed allowing families to deduct the interest they pay on student loans, and penalty-free withdrawal of ira (individual retirement account) funds for educational expenses. ensuring high standards in knowledge and skills. for america to compete in a world in which percent of all jobs will require high skills, we believe that students not planning to attend college need better opportunities. america's college graduates set the world pace for knowledge and skills. but we also have a strong commitment to the ""forgotten half"" of the students in our schools, students who will graduate from high school ill-prepared for work. we must build a well-educated, high-skills work force to ensure a new century of prosperity for america. the president has developed a sweeping youth apprenticeship strategy to meet this goal. his plan will ensure that students meet the high standards demanded of all high school students, while training them with a skill as well. we strongly support youth apprenticeships that include a year of college, to encourage a lifetime of learning and opportunity for students. our educational beliefs. we are confident that the united states can, by the end of this decade, reach the six national education goals that president bush and the nation's governors have established: that all children should arrive at school ready to learn; that high school graduation rates should be at least percent; that all children learn challenging subject matter and become responsible citizens; that american children should be first in the world in math and science; that there must be a literate and skilled work force; and that schools must be disciplined and free of drugs and violence. we have an uncompromising commitment to improve public education - which means assuring that our schools produce welleducated, responsible citizens - not the maintenance of a government monopoly over the means of educating. american families must be given choice in education. we value the important role played by our private, independent and parochial schools, colleges and universities. we believe that their quality is best encouraged by minimizing government regulation. we believe distance learning is a valuable tool in the fight to bring equal educational opportunity to every student regardless of wealth or geographic location. distance learning provides students access to the vast educational resources of our nation. we encourage the use of modern technology to meet the goal of educational excellence. we support policies that provide access for all instructional and educational programmers to permit them to provide the greatest choice of programming and material to schools and teachers. we also support policies that will encourage the use of all advanced technologies for the delivery of educational and instructional programming in order to give schools and teachers the greatest flexibility in providing creative and innovative instruction. we encourage local school boards to ensure review of these materials by parents and educators. we support efforts to open the teaching profession by reforming the certification system now barring many talented men and women from the classroom. schools should be - as they have been traditionally academic institutions. families and communities err when by neglect or design they transfer to the school responsibilities that belong in the home and in the community. schools were created to help and strengthen families, not to undermine or substitute for them. accordingly, we oppose programs in public schools that provide birth control or abortion services or referrals. instead, we encourage abstinence education programs with proven track records in protecting youth from disease, pregnancy and drug use. the critical public mission in education is to set tough, clear standards of achievement and ensure that those who educate our children are accountable for meeting them. this is not just a matter of plans or dollars. competency testing and merit pay for teachers are essential elements of such accountability. we are proud of our many dedicated, professional teachers and educators who have committed their lives to educating america's children. we also believe that powerful unions and liberal special interest groups should not be the driving force in educational reform. just as spiritual principles - our moral compass - help guide public policy, learning must have a moral basis. america must remain neutral toward particular religions, but we must not remain neutral toward religion itself or the values religion supports. mindful of our country's judeo-christian heritage and rich religious pluralism, we support the right of students to engage in voluntary prayer in schools and the right of the community to do so at commencements or other occasions. we will strongly enforce the law guaranteeing equal access to school facilities. we also advocate recitation of the pledge of allegiance in schools as a reminder of the principles that sustain us as one nation under god. our ambitious vision for america works, however, only in a society of well-educated citizens. the democratic party, beholden to the special interests that resist change, can never accomplish the improvements in education that our schools and our children so desperately need. indeed, they have no plan. the republican party has started an education revolution. we have presented a detailed plan which is even now becoming reality. the future of our nation demands no less. the president is leading the country on an education crusade, a crusade the american people have joined. for healthier families: promote health, prevent disease, reform health care. americans receive the finest medical care in the world. we have the best health-care providers, the best hospitals and the best medical technology. people come here from canada, from europe, from every part of the globe, to seek procedures and treatments that are either unavailable or strictly rationed in their home countries. but we must do better. costs are soaring. many americans, responsible for children and aging parents, worry about the quality and price of care. the election presents all of us with a clear choice. democrats want a costly, coercive system, imported from abroad, with a budget set by congress and policies set by bureaucrats. that is a prescription for misery. it would imperil jobs, require billions in new taxes, lower the quality of health care overall, drive health-care providers out of the profession, and result in rationing. the congressional democrats' health-care reform proposal would exclude themselves from coverage under their own program. they refuse to live with the scheme they are trying to force on the rest of the county. republicans believe government control of health care is irresponsible and ineffective. we believe health-care choices should remain in the hands of the people, not government bureaucrats. this issue truly represents a fundamental difference between the two parties. we endorse president bush's comprehensive health-care plan, which solves the two major problems of the current system access and affordability - while preserving the high-quality care americans now enjoy. the president's plan will make health care more affordable through tax credits and deductions that will offset insurance costs for million americans; and make health care more accessible, especially for small businesses, by reducing insurance costs and eliminating workers' worries of losing insurance if they change jobs. this plan will expand access to health care by: creating new tax credits and deductions to help low- and middle-income americans. these tax credits would be available in the form of vouchers for low-income people who work. providing insurance security for working americans by requiring insurers to cover pre-existing conditions. making health insurance premiums fully deductible for the self-employed. making it easier for small firms to purchase coverage for their employees. the proposal would allow small businesses to form health insurance purchasing pools that would make insurance more affordable. it also would guarantee the availability and renewability of insurance for small firms, set premium standards, pre-empt state mandated-benefit laws, establish minimum coverage plans, and require states to establish risk pools to spread risks broadly across health insurers. addressing the medical malpractice problem by a cap on noneconomic damage recoveries in malpractice claims and an alternative dispute resolution before going to court. in short, the president aims to make coverage available to all, guaranteed, renewable, with no preconditions. under his plan, no one will have to go broke to get well. the democrats' plan stands in stark philosophical contrast. instead of preserving individual options, it would rely on government bureaucrats. instead of preserving quality care, it would lead to rationing and waiting lines. and instead of enhancing the health-care security of american workers, it would require a massive increase in payroll taxes that would destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs. the democrats' so-called play-or-pay proposal would require employers either to provide health insurance for their workers or pay a new tax that would fund in part a new government-run health program. according to a study prepared by the urban institute, this mandate would require new federal taxes - or new federal borrowing - of $ billion in the first year alone. nearly million americans who now have private health insurance would be dumped by their employers onto the governmentrun plan. additional costs to employers - particularly small employers - would total an estimated $ billion in the first year. the republican staff of congress' joint economic committee estimates that , people would lose their jobs because of the play-or-pay mandate. republicans are also determined to resolve the crisis in medical liability, allowing physicians and certified midwives to deliver babies and practice in underserved areas. meaningful medical tort reform would assure that doctors would not have to practice medicine under a cloud of potential litigation. we will reduce administrative expenses and paperwork by adopting a uniform claim and data system. we pledge our support for rehabilitation and long-term care coverage. we will curb costs through better prenatal and other preventive care. we encourage the application of the good samaritan law to protect health-care providers who wish to volunteer their time to provide patient care to the community. we encourage coordinated care in public programs and private insurance. we further support regulatory reforms to speed the development of new drugs and medical technology. the health-care safety net must be secure for those who need preventive, acute and long-term care. special consideration should be given to abolishing or reforming programs which prohibit or discourage individuals from seeking to work their way out of poverty and dependency. we will reduce paperwork burdens and redirect those resources to actual services. we will enhance access to medical care through community health centers, which provide primary care in medically underserved areas. we will modify outdated antitrust rules that prohibit hospitals from merging their resources to provide improved, cost-effective health care. we encourage the use of telecommunications technology to link hospitals in larger communities with heath-care facilities in smaller communities. advanced communications networks will facilitate the sharing of resources, will improve access to affordable health care through the transmission of medical imaging and diagnostics and will ensure that americans living in rural areas have the same access to doctors and the latest medical procedures as americans living in urban areas. republicans focus on health, not just health care. we want not only to treat disease and disability but to reduce and prevent them. through funding for nih (the national institutes of health), we invest in research to cure a range of diseases, from cancer to heart disease, from multiple sclerosis to lupus. we support efforts which foster early cancer detection. even more important, we rely on individuals to lower the incidence of preventable illness and injury. a large part of our health-care costs, public and private, is caused by behavior. good judgment can save billions of dollars - and perhaps millions of lives. aids. the hiv/aids epidemic has exploded over the past decade into a crisis of tragic proportions. in our country, aids already has claimed more than , lives, and as many as million more americans may have been infected with the virus. epidemics have, throughout history, challenged governments, which have too often been powerless to combat them. science - and human wisdom - have advanced, however, and we have met this crisis not only with a massive commitment of resources but also with a personal determination on the part of the president. that commitment and leadership will continue. aids should be treated like any other communicable or sexually transmitted disease, while at the same time preserving patient confidentiality. we are committed to ensure that our nation's response to aids is shaped by compassion, not fear or ignorance and will oppose, as a matter of decency and honor, any discrimination against americans who are its victims. we encourage state legislatures to enact legislation which makes it a criminal act for anyone knowingly to transmit the aids virus. we will seek to ensure that medical personnel, and the people who trust in their care, will be protected against infection. this disease also challenges america scientifically. we must succeed in slowing the epidemic's spread. the administration has thus placed great emphasis on a variety of prevention efforts to do so. we must recognize, also, that prevention is linked ultimately to personal responsibility and moral behavior. we reject the notion that the distribution of clean needles and condoms are the solution to stopping the spread of aids. education designed to curb the spread of this disease should stress marital fidelity, abstinence and a drug-free lifestyle. there must be a means for successfully treating the virus, and this has led to a threefold increase in research and steps to speed the approval process for new drugs that could make a crucial difference to those infected. above all, a cure must be found. we have committed enormous resources - $. billion over the past four years for research alone, more than for any disease except cancer. in keeping with the american spirit, our fellow citizens with hiv/aids deserve our compassion and our care, and they deserve our united commitment to a cure. healthy families. responsible families are the key to wellness. they are the best guard against infant mortality and child abuse. we support programs to help mothers and their babies get a good start in life; and we call for strong action, at all levels of government, to enforce parental responsibility with regard to alcohol, drugs and neglect. we applaud the president's initiatives to require the involvement of more women in clinical trials and to create within nih a center to combat breast and cervical cancer. we also call for expanded research on various diseases, common to both men and women, but whose effects on women have yet to be determined. we call for fetal protection in the workplace and in scientific research. the homeless. the bush administration has worked vigorously to address this tragedy, believing that involuntary homelessness in america is unacceptable. accordingly, the administration has proposed $ billion in homeless assistance, an amount cut back by the democrat-controlled congress. we have also implemented a usshelter plus care program designed to assist homeless persons who are mentally ill, chemically dependent or stricken with aids. republicans remain determined to help the homeless as a matter of ethical commitment as well as sound public policy. older americans. the interests of older americans are addressed throughout this platform, for the elderly play an honored role in all walks of american life. from reducing inflation to fighting crime, from quality health care to a cleaner environment, the republican agenda for all has particular relevance to those who have worked the longest and grown the wisest. we reaffirm our commitment to a strong social security system. to stop penalizing grandparents and other seniors who care for children, we pledge to continue the republican crusade to end the earnings limitation for social security recipients. more than ever, our nation needs older americans in its schools and workplaces. there should be no barriers to their full participation in our country's future. we pledge support for greater availability of long-term care and for research to combat alzheimer's disease. republicans also took the lead in expanding home health care in government programs, and we want to build on that accomplishment. promoting cultural values. the culture of our nation has traditionally supported those pillars on which civilized society is built: personal responsibility, morality and the family. today, however, these pillars are under assault. elements within the media, the entertainment industry, academia and the democratic party are waging a guerrilla war against american values. they deny personal responsibility, disparage traditional morality, denigrate religion and promote hostility toward the family's way of life. children, the members of our society most vulnerable to cultural influences, are barraged with violence and promiscuity, encouraging reckless and irresponsible behavior. this undermines the authority of parents, the ones most responsible for passing on to their offspring a sense of right and wrong. the lesson our party draws is important - that all of us, individuals and corporations alike, have a responsibility to reflect the values we expect our fellow citizens to exhibit. and if children grow to adulthood reflecting not the values of their parents but the amorality with which they are bombarded, those who send such messages cannot duck culpability. one example is the advocacy of violence against law enforcement officers, promoted by a corporation more interested in profits than the possible consequences of such a message. we believe, in the spirit of theodore roosevelt, that corporations - like individuals - have responsibilities to society, and that conscience alone should prevent such outrages. we also stand united with those private organizations, such as the boy scouts of america, who are defending decency in fulfillment of their own moral responsibilities. we reject the irresponsible position of those corporations that have cut off contributions to such organizations because of their courageous stand for family values. moreover, we oppose efforts by the democratic party to include sexual preference as a protected minority receiving preferential status under civil rights statutes at the federal, state and local level. we oppose any legislation or law that legally recognizes same-sex marriages and allows such couples to adopt children or provide foster care. we must recognize that the time has come for a national crusade against pornography. some would have us believe that obscenity and pornography have no social impact. but if hardcore pornography does not cheapen the human spirit, then neither does shakespeare elevate it. we call on federal agencies to halt the sale, under government auspices, of pornographic materials. we endorse republican legislation, the pornography victims compensation act, allowing victims of pornography to seek damages from those who make or sell it, especially since the commission on pornography, in , found a direct link between pornography and violent crimes committed against women and children. we also believe that the various state legislatures should create a civil cause of action against makers and distributors of pornography when their material incites a violent crime. government has a responsibility, as well, to ensure that it promotes the common moral values that bind us together as a nation. we therefore condemn the use of public funds to subsidize obscenity and blasphemy masquerading as art. the fine arts, including those with public support, can certainly enrich our society. however, no artist has an inherent right to claim taxpayer support for his or her private vision of art if that vision mocks the moral and spiritual basis on which our society is founded. we believe a free market in art - with neither suppression nor favoritism by government - is the best way to foster the cultural revival our country needs. individual rights, good homes and safe streets at a time when the rest of the world has rejected socialism, there are communities here at home where free markets have not been permitted to flourish. decades of liberalism have left us with two economies. the pro growth economy rewards effort, promotes thrift and supports strong families. the other economy stifles initiative and is anti-work and anti family. in one economy, people are free to be owners and entrepreneurs. in the other economy, people are at the mercy of government. we are determined to elevate the poor into the pro-growth economy. republicans will lead a new national consensus around economic opportunity, greater access to property, home ownership and housing, jobs and entrepreneurship. we must bring the great promise of america to every city, every small town, and to all our people. our agenda for equality of opportunity runs throughout this platform and applies to all americans. there is no such thing as segregated success. we reject the democrats' politics of division, envy and conflict. they believe that america is split into classes and can be healed only through the redistribution of wealth. we believe in the economics of multiplication: free markets expand opportunity and wealth for all. that is true liberation. it frees poor people not only from want but also from government control. that is why liberal democrats have fought us every step of the way, refusing congressional action on enterprise zones until los angeles burned - and then mocking the expectations of the poor by gutting that critical proposal. they can kill bills, but they cannot kill hope. we are determined to pass that legislation for the sake of all who are awaiting their chance for the american dream. we will eliminate laws that keep americans out of jobs, like the outdated ban on home work. the antiquated davis-bacon act inflates taxpayer costs and keeps willing workers from getting jobs in federally assisted projects. it must go. unlike the democrats, we believe the private sector, not the federal government, should set prevailing wage rates. as explained elsewhere in this platform, low-income families must gain control of their future through choice in their children's education. rebuilding the dream. our party has always championed the american dream of home ownership. abraham lincoln wanted all families to have access to property, because it would give them a tangible stake in their family's future. as families built homes and improved the land, they built a brighter future for themselves and a legacy for their children. lincoln's homestead act of did all this without enlarging government. it empowered families. in the tradition of lincoln, president bush has replicated the american dream of home ownership. for first-time home buyers, he has proposed a $, tax credit. for lower-income families, he has worked to restore opportunity through hope, his initiative to help tenants now dependent on federal aid to buy their own homes; mortgage revenue bonds, to assist more than . million families to buy a first home; low-income housing tax credits, already producing more than , decent apartments at affordable prices; and home, a partnership among all levels of government to help low-income families secure better housing. for everyone, but especially for the poor, the best housing policy is non inflationary economic growth and low interest rates, the heart of our opportunity agenda. ending dependency. welfare is the enemy of opportunity and stable family life. two decades ago, decisions about public assistance were taken away from states and communities and given to washington officials. since then, almost everything has gone wrong. since , we have spent $. trillion on welfare. it brought a horrendous expansion of dependence, especially among mothers and children. today's welfare system is anti-work and anti-marriage. it taxes families to subsidize illegitimacy. it rewards unethical behavior and penalizes initiative. it cannot be merely tinkered with by congress; it must be re created by states and localities. republican governors and legislators in several states have already launched dramatic reforms, especially with workfare and learnfare. welfare can no longer be a check in the mail with no responsibility. we believe fathers and mothers must be held responsible for their children. we support stronger enforcement of child support laws. we call for strong enforcement and tough penalties against welfare fraud and insist that work must be a mandatory part of public assistance for all who are able to work. because divorce, desertion and illegitimacy account for almost all the increase in child poverty over the last years, we put the highest priority upon enforcement of family rights and responsibilities. among these responsibilities is the obligation to get an education - a key to avoiding dependency. families on welfare with school-age children must be required to send them to school or provide adequate home education in keeping with various state laws in order to continue receiving public assistance. young adult heads of welfare households should be required to complete appropriate education or training programs. safe homes and streets. one of the first duties of government is to protect the public security - to maintain law and order so that citizens are free to pursue the fruits of life and liberty. the democrats have forsaken this solemn pledge. instead of protecting society from hardened criminals, they blame society and refuse to hold accountable for their actions individuals who have chosen to engage in violent and criminal conduct. this has led to the state of affairs in which we find ourselves today. violent crime is the gravest domestic threat to our way of life. it has turned our communities into battlegrounds, playgrounds into graveyards. it threatens everyone, but especially the very young, the elderly, the weak. it destroys business and suffocates economic opportunity in struggling communities. it is a travesty that some american children have to sleep in bathtubs for protection from stray bullets. the poverty of values that justifies drive-by shootings and random violence holds us hostage and insecure, even in our own homes. we must work to develop community-help projects designed to instill a sense of responsibility and pride. this is the legacy of a liberalism that elevates criminals' rights above victims' rights, that justifies soft-on-crime judges' approving early release prison programs and that leaves law enforcement officers powerless to deter crime with the threat of certain punishment. for years, two republican presidents have fought to reverse this trend, along with republican officials in the states. they have named tough law and-order judges, pushed for minimum mandatory sentences, expanded federal assistance to states and localities, sought to help states redress court orders on prison overcrowding, and devoted record resources that are turning the tide against drugs. they have repeatedly proposed legislation, consistently rejected by congressional democrats, to restore the severest penalties for the most heinous crimes, to ensure swift and certain punishment, and to end the legal loopholes that let criminals go free. congressional democrats reject republican reform of the exclusionary rule that prohibits use of relevant evidence obtained in good faith and allows criminals, even murderers, to go free on a technicality. they reject our reform of habeas corpus law to prevent the appellate process from becoming a lawyers' game to thwart justice through endless appeals and procedural delays. they refuse to enact effective procedures to reinstate the death penalty for the most heinous crimes. they reject tougher, mandatory sentences for career criminals. instead, congressional democrats actually voted to create more loopholes for vicious thugs and fewer protections for victims of crime and have opposed mandatory restitution for victims. their crime legislation, which we emphatically reject, cripples law enforcement by overturning over united states supreme court cases that have helped to reduce crime and keep violent criminal offenders off the streets. for too long our criminal justice system has carefully protected the rights of criminals and neglected the suffering of the innocent victims of crime and their families. we support the rights of crime victims to be present, heard and informed throughout the criminal justice process, and to be provided with restitution and services to aid their recovery. we believe in giving police the resources to do their job. law enforcement must remain primarily a state and local responsibility. with percent of all violent crimes within the jurisdiction of the states, we have led efforts to increase the number of police protecting our citizens. we also support incentives to encourage personnel leaving the armed forces to continue to defend their country - against the enemy within - by entering the law enforcement profession. narcotics traffic drives street crime. president bush has, for the first time, used the resources of our armed forces against the international drug trade. by our insistence, multilateral control of precursor chemicals and money laundering is now an international priority. we decry efforts by congressional democrats to slash international anti-narcotics funding and inhibit the most vital control efforts in peru. we support efforts to work with south and central american leaders to eradicate crops used to produce illegal narcotics. the republican party is committed to a drug-free america. during the last years, we have radically reversed the democrats' attitude of tolerance toward narcotics, vastly increased federal operations against drugs, cleaned up the military and launched mandatory testing for employees in various fields, including white house personnel. as a result, overall drug abuse is falling. we urge that states and communities emphasize anti-drug education by police officers and others in schools to educate young children to the dangers of the drug culture. dope is no longer trendy. we oppose legalizing or decriminalizing drugs. that is a morally abhorrent idea, the last vestige of an ill-conceived philosophy that counseled the legitimacy of permissiveness. today, a similarly dysfunctional morality explains away drug dealing as an escape, and drive-by shootings as an act of political violence. there is no excuse for the wanton destruction of human life. we therefore support the stiffest penalties, including the death penalty, for major drug traffickers. drug users must face punishment, including fines and imprisonment, for contributing to the demand that makes the drug trade profitable. among possible sanctions should be the loss of government assistance and suspension of drivers' licenses. residents of public housing should be able to protect their families against drugs by screening out abusers and dealers. we support grass-roots action to drive dealers and crack houses out of operation. safe streets also mean highways that are free of drunken drivers and drivers under the influence of illegal drugs. republicans support the toughest possible state laws to deal with drunken drivers and users of illegal drugs, who deserve no sympathy from our courts or state legislatures. we also oppose the illicit abuse of legal drugs. white-collar crime threatens homes and families in a different way. it steals secretly, forcing up prices, rigging contracts, swindling consumers and harming the overwhelming majority of business people who play fair and obey the law. we support imprisonment for those who steal from the american people. we pledge an all-out fight against it, especially within the political machines that control many of our major cities. we will continue to bring to justice corrupt politicians and those who collude with them to plunder savings and loans. new members of the american family. our nation of immigrants continues to welcome those seeking a better life. this reflects our past, when some newcomers fled intolerance; some sought prosperity; some came as slaves. all suffered and sacrificed but hoped their children would have a better life. all searched for a shared vision - and found one in america. today we are stronger for our diversity. illegal entry into the united states, on the other hand, threatens the social compact on which immigration is based. that is, the nation accepts immigrants and is enriched by their determination and values. illegal immigration, on the other hand, undermines the integrity of border communities and already crowded urban neighborhoods. we will build on the already announced strengthening of the border patrol to better coordinate interdiction of illegal entrants through greater cross-border cooperation. specifically, we will increase the size of the border patrol in order to meet the increasing need to stop illegal immigration and we will equip the border patrol with the tools, technologies and structures necessary to secure the border. we will seek stiff penalties for those who smuggle illegal aliens into the country, and for those who produce or sell fraudulent documents. we also will reduce incentives to enter the united states by promoting initiatives such as the north american free trade agreement. in creating new economic opportunity in mexico, a nafta removes the incentive to cross the border illegally in search of work. individual rights. the protection of individual rights is the foundation for opportunity and security. the republican party is unique in this regard. since its inception, it has respected every person, even when that proposition was not universally popular. today, as in the day of lincoln, we insist that no american's rights are negotiable. that is why we declare that bigotry and prejudice have no place in american life. we denounce all who practice or promote racism, anti semitism or religious intolerance. we believe churches and religious schools should not be taxed; we defend the right of religious leaders to speak out on public issues; and we condemn the cowardly desecration of places of worship that has shocked our country in recent years. asserting equal rights for all, we support the bush administration's vigorous enforcement of statutes to prevent illegal discrimination on account of sex, race, creed or national origin. promoting opportunity, we reject efforts to replace equal rights with quotas or other preferential treatment. that is why president bush fought so long against the democrat congress to win a civil rights bill worthy of that name. we renew the historic republican commitment to the rights of women, from the early days of the suffragist movement to the present. because legal rights mean little without opportunity, we assert economic growth as the key to the continued progress of women in all fields of american life. we believe the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life that cannot be infringed. we therefore reaffirm our support for a human life amendment to the constitution, and we endorse legislation to make clear that the 14th amendment's protections apply to unborn children. we oppose using public revenues for abortion and will not fund organizations that advocate it. we commend those who provide alternatives to abortion by meeting the needs of mothers and offering adoption services. we reaffirm our support for appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life. president bush signed into law the greatest advance ever for disabled persons: the americans with disabilities act, a milestone in removing barriers to full participation in our country's life. we will fully implement it with sensitivity to the needs of small businesses, just as we have earlier legal protections for the disabled in federal programs. we oppose the non-consensual withholding of health care or treatment from any person because of handicap, age or infirmity, just as we oppose euthanasia and assisted suicide. we support full access to the polls, and the entire political process, by disabled voters. we will ensure that students with disabilities benefit from america 's new emphasis on testing for excellence and accountability for results. promoting the rights of the disabled requires, before all else, an expanding economy, both to advance assistive technology and to create opportunities for personal advancement. that is another reason why republicans are committed to growth. we reaffirm our commitment to the fifth amendment to the constitution: ""no person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."" we support strong enforcement of this takings clause to keep citizens secure in the use and development of their property. we also seek to reduce the amount of land owned or controlled by the government, especially in the western states. we insist upon prompt payment for private lands certified as critical for preserving essential parks and preserves. republicans defend the constitutional right to keep and bear arms. we call for stiff mandatory sentences for those who use firearms in a crime. we note that those who seek to disarm citizens in their homes are the same liberals who tried to disarm our nation during the cold war and are today seeking to cut our national defense below safe levels. we applaud congressional republicans for overturning the district of columbia's law blaming firearm manufacturers for street crime. we affirm the right of individuals to form, join or assist labor organizations to bargain collectively, consistent with state laws. we support the right of states to enact right-towork laws. a republican congress will amend the hobbs act, so that union officials will not be exempt from the law's prohibition against extortion and violence. we call for greater legal protection from violence for workers who stay on the job during strikes. we support self-determination for indian tribes in managing their own affairs and resources. recognizing the government-togovernment trust responsibility, we aim to end dependency fostered by federal controls. reservations and tribal lands held in trust should be free to become enterprise zones so their people can fully share in the nation's prosperity. we will work with tribal governments to improve education, health, economic opportunity and environmental conditions. we endorse efforts to preserve the culture and languages of native americans and hawaiians and to ensure their equitable participation in federal programs. uniting our country security and opportunity in a changing economy over the last four years, the united states has achieved our overriding objective since the end of world war ii. communism and other forms of planned economies lie in the ash heap of history, defeated not only by our military strength but by the force of our ideas - democracy and free enterprise. now a huge international market is evolving. combined with america's low inflation and low interest rate environment, it presents us with unprecedented economic opportunity. we commit to the proposition that the american economy will remain first in the world. this is our goal. achieving it will ensure that our people will enjoy the jobs, benefits and economic growth to sustain the american dream for themselves and their posterity. republicans believe that the greatest engine for social change and economic progress is the entrepreneurial economy. we believe that america has broken down the lines of class to a greater degree than any society on earth, not because of government but because of an economic system that allows men and women to create wealth for themselves and their communities. we believe that positive change can occur and benefit all americans if we continue to remove governmental barriers to entrepreneurship and, thus, economic growth. our cause embraces traditional ideals and modern realities. it both reforms and innovates. we aim to shape history through faith in one another. because we look forward, we emphasize saving, investment and job creation. we encourage innovation and the entrepreneurial spirit that are, together, part of our national character. we both conserve and develop our natural resources. because we have learned from the past, we are determined to change what desperately needs changing in government. government does not have all the answers, but we know where to find them: in the spirit of our people. we know the weapons for this battle: economic and political liberty in the pursuit of happiness. we understand that material gain improves life only if it lifts us all to pursue higher ends: self-respect, work and study, a decent life and future for our children, and a useful old age. so we rededicate ourselves to the truths the nation keeps coming back to -the simple, spiritual truths about our family, our country, our world - for upon them we will build our more perfect union. security and opportunity in a changing economy our economy is people, not statistics. the american people, not government, rescued the united states from an economic collapse triggered by democrats in the 1970s. crippled by taxes, robbed by inflation, threatened by controls, stunned by interest rates, the people ended america's decline and restored hope across our country and around our world. we launched an era of growth and prosperity such as the world had never seen: million new jobs in the longest peacetime economic expansion in the history of the republic. we curbed the size and power of the federal establishment. we lowered tax rates. we restored a sound dollar. we unleashed the might of free people to produce, compete and triumph in free markets. we gave them the tools; they completed the job. during the 1980s and into the present decade, the u.s. economy once again became the engine of global growth. inflation has fallen to its lowest level in years. interest rates dropped percentage points. productivity has sharply risen. exports are booming. despite a global downturn in late , real economic growth resumed last year and has continued for five consecutive quarters. with low interest rates and low inflation, the american economy is poised for stronger growth through the rest of the 1990s. keeping inflation and interest rates low and stable through a sound monetary policy is essential for economic growth. these gains were made in spite of the leaders of the democratic party. they continue to delay and defeat the president's agenda for growth, jobs and prosperity. spending faster than ever, they blocked republican reforms that would have saved billions of wasted taxpayer dollars. they refused to give the president a line-item veto to curb their self-serving pork-barrel projects. the congressional democrat leadership killed the taxpayer protection amendment for a balanced budget in the democratcontrolled house of representatives. it was supported by percent of the republican members; percent of the democrat members voted no. then they rigged parliamentary procedures to forbid a vote on that amendment in the democrat-controlled senate. every republican senator voted twice to end the filibuster, while more than percent of the democrats voted twice to keep the filibuster going. their nominee this year for the vice presidency supported the filibuster and spurned the balanced-budget amendment. they played citizens against one another, wallowing in the politics of hate and envy to smear the wonder of social mobility. they lied about america's achievement in the 1980s, rewriting history to erase the true accomplishments of the american people. keeping what you earn. the test of economic policy is whether it promotes economic growth and expands job opportunities. lower taxes and an expanding economy depend on long-term, consistent restraint in the growth of federal spending. in , as the deficit was threatening to balloon and further harm the economy, the president pushed for cuts in government spending overall and for caps on mandatory spending. the democrat congress insisted, however, on a tax hike as their price for controlling spending. in short, the democrats held the u.s. economy - and u.s. jobs - hostage in order to raise taxes, much as they had done to president reagan. just as they did with president reagan, the democratcontrolled congress promised president bush they would abide by binding controls on federal spending; and just as with president reagan, they broke their word. republicans will not again agree to such a program. this year, to create jobs and promote growth, president bush submitted a program of tax cuts and incentives designed to get the economy moving again - a program very similar to one he had sent to congress in early . the democrats' response was predictable - instead of cutting taxes, they passed a $ billion tax increase that would have smothered growth and jobs. the president, true to our republican philosophy, vetoed this tax hike, and sustained his veto with the support of republicans in congress. now a new democrat nominee comes forward with his plan for the economy. with a clean piece of paper, and every opportunity to end his party's romance with taxes, he has instead proposed the largest tax increase in american history. his tax increases, his proposed mandated benefits on small firms, and his further reductions in defense would cost the jobs of . million americans. with his present spending increases, his plan would greatly increase the federal budget and the deficit. the simple truth for the american people is this: the only safeguard between themselves and democrat tax increases is the use of the veto by george bush and enough republican votes in congress to sustain it. the truth is that the democrat philosophy of bigger government and rigorous redistribution of income requires them to push for ever increasing spending and ever higher taxes. the choice is clear - between george bush, who vetoes tax increases, and his opponent, who proposes a $ billion tax increase. our republican position is equally clear: we will oppose any attempt to increase taxes. furthermore, republicans believe that the taxes insisted on by the democrats in the budget agreement were recessionary. the democrat congress held president bush and indeed all americans hostage, refusing to take even modest steps to control spending, unless taxes were increased. the american economy suffered as a result. we believe the tax increases of should ultimately be repealed. just as history shows that tax increases destroy jobs and economic growth, it also shows that the proper path to create jobs and growth is tax rate reduction. we commend those congressional and senatorial candidates who pledge to oppose tax rate increases. as the deficit comes under control, we aspire to further tax rate cuts, strengthening incentives to work, save, invest and innovate. we also support president bush's efforts to reduce federal spending and to cap the growth of non-social security entitlements. republicans want individuals and families to control their own economic destiny. only long-term expansion of our economy and jobs can make the american dream a reality for generations to come. that is why we demand that the congress do what president bush called for last january: open a new era of growth and opportunity by enacting his comprehensive plan for economic recovery, including a reduction in the capital gains tax; an investment tax allowance; a $, tax credit for first-time home buyers; a needed modification of the ""passive loss rule""; a $ increase in the personal income tax exemption; making permanent the research and development tax credit; and the passage of federal enterprise zone legislation. we support restoring the deductibility of iras for all americans, including full-time homemakers, and encourage savings for education and home ownership through family savings accounts. the president's family savings accounts will be an impetus to the economy. let families use their iras for firsttime home purchases, for college education and for medical emergencies. we will cut the capital gains tax rate to percent - zero in enterprise zones - and index it so government cannot profit from inflation by taxing phantom capital gains, literally stealing from savings and pensions. we reject the notion advanced by democrats that this enhances the wealthy. to the contrary, it would encourage investment, create new jobs, make capital available for business expansion and contribute to economic expansion. reducing the tax on investment will be the biggest possible boost for the new technologies, businesses and jobs we need for the next century. if government taxes capital gains at such a high rate that there is no incentive to take risks, to build businesses, to invest, to create jobs or to better oneself, then jobs and small businesses vanish, and everyone's opportunities are diminished. cutting the rate, on the other hand, will help supply seed capital where it is needed most - in our poorest communities. refusing to cut it will handcuff america in international competition and will shackle aspiring entrepreneurs in inner cities and poor rural areas. to encourage investment in new technologies, we will make permanent the research and development tax credit. for the same reason, we want to expand deductibility for investments in new plant and equipment. we support further tax simplification. the tax code should create jobs for americans, not profits for tax lawyers, lobbyists and tax shelters. small businesses should spend more time hiring and producing, not filling out irs forms. we oppose taxing religious and ethnic fraternal benefit societies because of their vital role in fostering charity and patriotism. we also oppose tax withholding on savings and dividends. we applaud the efforts by president bush to help workers who change jobs by enhancing the portability of pensions. leading democrat members of congress have called for a national sales tax, or european style value-added tax (vat), which would take billions of dollars out of the hands of american consumers. such a tax has been imposed on many nations in europe and has resulted in higher prices, fewer jobs and higher levels of government spending. republicans oppose the idea of putting a vat on the backs of the american people. republicans believe in expanding the economy. jobs and growth are our answer to the future. the future is the family. the most dramatic change in the tax code in our lifetime is one that has never been explicitly enacted by congress or reported as a specific new event. it is the gradual, year-by-year erosion of the personal exemption, until it was indexed by a republican administration in . republicans also led the way in the 1980s by increasing the personal exemption from $, to $,. this platform calls for another immediate increase of $, but in the long run we are committed to fully restoring the inflation-adjusted value of the personal exemption. this will require reductions in federal spending, which is why the best hope for tax fairness for america's families lies in a republican congress. liberation through deregulation. government regulation is a hidden tax on american families, costing each household more than $, every year. it stifles job creation and hobbles our national competitiveness. the ""iron triangle"" of special interests, federal bureaucrats and democrat congressional staff is robbing consumers and producers alike. we support president bush's freeze on new regulations. we applaud his competitiveness council, under vice president quayle, for fighting the regulatory mania, saving the public $ billion with its initial -day moratorium on new regulations and billions more under the current day freeze. we call for a permanent moratorium until our regulatory reforms are fully in place. they include market-based regulation, cost benefit analysis of all new rule-making, and a regulatory budget that will make congress admit - and correct - the harm it does by legislation that destroys jobs and competitiveness. we recognize that property rights are being endangered by government over-regulation. we reaffirm the constitutional right to private ownership of property; this right is paramount in our free society. every rule that reduces the value of private property is what our constitution calls a ""taking."" this underthe-table taxation is unfair, immoral and economically destructive. we support legislation to require full compensation of property owners who are victims of regulatory takings. home ownership. the best housing policy is a noninflationary, growing economy that has produced low mortgage rates and has made housing more affordable. we demand congress enact president's bush's housing program introduced as part of his pro-growth package in january. provide a $, tax credit for first-time home buyers and allow them penalty-free ira withdrawals. set a modified ""passive loss rule"" for active real estate investors. extend tax preferences for mortgage revenue bonds and lowincome housing. and allow deductions for losses on personal residences. the average american's home is his or her primary asset. that asset should be completely shielded from federal taxation, allowing the homeowner to maintain it or access it as he or she sees fit. we call for the complete elimination of the capital gains tax on the sale of a principal residence. owning a home is not just an investment. it is a commitment to the community, a guard against crime, a statement about family life. it is a crucial component of upward mobility. to advance these goals, republicans are determined to preserve deductibility of mortgage interest. bureaucratic government imposes too many regulatory barriers to affordable housing. these barriers must come down. we applaud efforts in the states to lower property taxes, which strike hardest at the poor, the elderly, families with children and family farmers. we advocate repeal of rent-control laws, which help the affluent and hurt low-income families by causing housing shortages. we support the fha (federal housing administration) mortgage insurance program, the government national mortgage association, the va (department of veterans affairs) guarantee program and other programs that enhance housing choices for all. we urge federal departments and agencies to work with the private sector to bring foreclosed housing stock back into service as soon as possible. we reaffirm our commitment to open housing, without quotas or controls, as part of the opportunity we seek for all. for low-income families, the republican party stands for a revolution in housing by converting public housing into homes owned by low-income americans. president bush is eager to work closely with the states to fight and win a new conservative war on poverty. the truest measure of our success will not be how many families we add to housing assistance rolls but, rather, how many families move into the ranks of homeownership. but every part of that opportunity agenda has been thwarted by landlord democrats in congress. we ask the electorate: end the strangulation of divided government. give republicans the chance to move housing policy off the democratic party plantation into the mainstream of american life. resident management and ownership of public housing reflects this american mission, not only to assure political freedom but to allow all our fellow citizens to build a better life for themselves and their children. congressional democrats have consistently blocked efforts to repeal the earnings test which prevents people over age from keeping their jobs and remaining productive members of the work force. the social security earnings test discriminates against senior citizens. these senior citizens have to pay the highest marginal tax rate of any americans. we support repeal of the social security earnings test. controlling government spending. for years, republicans in the white house and congress have battled a democrat system corrupt and contemptuous of the american taxpayer. our republican presidents have vetoed one reckless bill after another. but liberal democrats still control a rigged machine that keeps on spending the public's money. the only solution is for the voters to end divided government so that a republican congress can enact the balancedbudget amendment, requiring a supermajority for any future tax increases. and since the democrat controlled congress has consistently voted down a line-item veto amendment for the president to control specific wasteful pork barrel spending, a republican congress will adopt a line-item veto for the presidency, restore presidential power to rescind spending and to lower specific appropriations. deficits have grown as democrat congresses have converted government assistance programs into entitlements and allowed spending to become uncontrolled. a republican congress, working with a republican president, will consider non-social security mandatory spending portions of the federal budget when looking for savings. when legislators and bureaucrats waste tax money, they deserve to lose their jobs. when they save money, they deserve praise. when federal programs have outlived their usefulness, they deserve a decent burial. when federal judges dare to seize the power of the purse, by ordering the imposition of taxes, they should be removed from office by the procedures provided by the constitution. the latest democrat scam is to raise taxes for ""investment"" - a code word for more government spending. a republican congress will foster investment where it does the most good, by individuals within the private sector. job creation and small-business opportunities. the engines of growth in a free economy are small businesses and jobs. almost percent of all businesses in america are considered small. small business is the backbone of the american economy. for the past years it has led the way in economic growth. small business generates percent of all new jobs. employment in industries dominated by small business increased more than twice as fast as in industries dominated by large businesses. small business plays a critical role in america's economic health. what happens on main street drives what happens on wall street. to create jobs and keep small business growing, the republican party supports increased access to capital for business expansion, exporting, long-term investment, opportunity capital for the disadvantaged, and capital to bring new products and new technology to the market. the republican party enthusiastically encourages the passage of federal enterprise zones. enterprise zones have been effective programs for promoting growth in urban and rural america. republicans believe that the concept of enterprise zones is based on unyielding faith in the entrepreneurial spirit of all americans. enterprise zones foster individual initiative and government deregulation. the states have come a long way in developing successful enterprise zone programs. state programs could only benefit from federal efforts. congress should follow the lead of president bush and hud secretary jack kemp in passing the federal enterprise zone program that will empower communities by reducing government regulation and taxation. the implementation of enterprise zones as an incentive for job creation and business development is also essential to further job and business opportunities. these efforts are bolstered by continued support of job training and minority business development programs, which have been created and implemented by the president's administration within the last three years. this is of special import to women, who own percent of the nation's businesses, most of them small ones. because the regulation of securities markets bars most small businesses from easy access to capital, we also support the small business administration's section (a) loan guarantee program and similar efforts that essentially compensate for the burdens government itself imposes upon entrepreneurs. leading the information age. the nation's telecommunications infrastructure will be essential to growth and competitiveness in the information age. the most far-reaching transformation of daily life since the harnessing of electricity will mean unprecedented opportunity for rural areas, reduced commuting, health care in the home and empowerment for the disabled. today, however, government policy at both the federal and state levels is standing in the way of this telecommunications progress. existing judicial, legislative and regulatory market allocation schemes constitute a counterproductive industrial policy by prohibiting the full participation by all providers in all segments of the telecommunications marketplace. we need to liberate this future-oriented technology and, in turn, empower the american people by giving consumers a truly competitive choice and lower prices. as a result, we republicans believe that full and open competition in the telecommunications marketplace is the most effective means for the united states to achieve our goal of having the most technologically advanced telecommunications infrastructure in the world. jobs through science and technology. we believe technology holds the key to america's future - and the future is bright. america is not in decline. america is still the land of opportunity. the new horizon is science and technology. new discoveries, new challenges and new opportunities await us. science and technology offer us change - exciting, dramatic and positive change in the well-being of every american. scientific research and development in genetics, biotechnology and electronics will provide better, more affordable health care for all americans. distance learning, through technology, will help bring exciting, quality, affordable education to all students, even in rural areas and inner cities. technology will help us conquer disease, protect the environment and provide a more abundant, healthier food supply. and technology will lead to better jobs and a better quality of life for all of us - and for our children and our children's children. scientific and technological developments in telecommunications, high performance computers, high-speed data networks, digitization, advanced software, biotechnology, highenergy physics, advanced materials, superconductors, manufacturing processes, energy, transportation, agriculture, oceanography, atmospheric studies, geological research, space and the environment are some of the keys to increases in productivity. and increases in productivity will create economic growth and a higher standard of living for all of us. technology is also critical to our national defense. we believe america must make technological development one of its highest priorities. we therefore support efforts to promote science and technology - providing funding for basic research, supporting investment in emerging technologies, improving education in science and engineering, enhancing tax credits for research and development, eliminating unnecessary regulation to create competitive markets, and protecting intellectual property. we further support efforts to increase the pace of technology transfer from the government to the private sector, where the fruits of this research can be used in the free market to create new processes, products and most important, jobs. we believe these policies will make us internationally competitive and will lead to a bright and prosperous future for our nation. president bush has provided leadership in this area by developing budgets allocating major new resources to scientific endeavors. the national science foundation, the national institutes of health, the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa), and the research and development program in the departments of energy and commerce have all become budget priorities under the president's leadership. the sad fact is, however, that the democrat congress has cut steadily and sharply in science areas in order to expand spending on social programs. this is shortsighted; the truth is that american innovation in science and engineering will expand our economy and jobs to greater social advantage to all americans. a republican congress working with president bush would reflect our interest in advancing scientific inquiry and assuring the resulting economic benefits for all americans. space. we are a pioneer people. today's telecommunications revolution began with the first satellites of the eisenhower years. so too, what we now do - or fail to do - in space will determine the future for generations to come. that is why president bush established the national space council under vice president quayle. together, they rescued a floundering program, revamped nasa, opened up competition and engaged the best minds of academia and research in a twofold mission for mankind. mission to planet earth will define and perhaps mitigate effects on our fragile environment. mission from planet earth will open space for science and industry. especially in this columbian year, we hail the president's decision ""to return to the moon, this time to stay, and then a journey to tomorrow, a mission to mars."" investments in space, though aimed at the future, pay dividends right now - in research and medicine, in international competitiveness and domestic opportunity. this must not be diverted to political pork barrels. the journey to the stars used to be a bipartisan adventure, but many democrat officeholders have jumped ship. republicans, by contrast, are determined to complete space station freedom within this decade. our agenda is to lower the cost of access to space, and to broaden that access to the private sector, with a family of new launchers; to build and fly sensors for the global environment; and to advance cutting-edge capabilities like the national aerospace plane and single stageto-orbit rockets, so technological breakthroughs can be quickly exploited. we will promote space-based industry and ensure that space remains a frontier for private enterprise, not a restricted preserve for government. we will continue international cooperation in space ventures and welcome russia's cosmonauts and citizens of other nations to fly for freedom. banking and job creation. job creation and economic growth are dependent on a healthy and competitive financial services system that can respond to the needs of the market. the democrat congress stalled republican legislation to prevent the savings and loan crisis. then, last year, the congress refused to pass the republican administration's comprehensive financial sector reform bill to strengthen our banking industry and let it compete, both domestically and internationally, consistent with the principles of safety and soundness. we applaud the president's efforts to alleviate the continuing problems caused by lack of funds available to creditworthy borrowers in small businesses and the housing industry. we endorse his efforts to restrain overzealous regulators, reduce regulatory compliance costs, strengthen financial institutions through diversification and reduce unnecessary barriers to lending. trade: a new world of growth. four years ago, the american people faced an historic decision: compete or retreat. they chose, with president bush, to compete in the international arena. rather than retreat with the democrats to the limits of yesteryear, they decided to attack the international marketplace with characteristic american vigor. just as george bush is a proven world leader on the military front, equally he is an economic world leader. the results are spectacular. we have cut the trade deficit in half in just four years. the united states is again the world's top exporter. exports drive our economy. every $ billion in exports creates , new jobs for americans. exports have created nearly million new jobs at home since . we are tough free traders, battling to sweep away barriers to our exports. we are waging the uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt) negotiations to win worldwide reductions in tariffs, elimination of subsidies and protection of american intellectual property rights. we are fighting to reduce farm subsidies in the european community and to break up their government-industry collusion in production of civil aircraft. we firmly endorse president bush's policy to support the republic of china on taiwan in international trade and her accession to gatt. major market access gains have been made with japan, with american manufacturing exports tripling since . throughout the world, we enforced greater compliance with u.s. trade rights. and we are making every effort to bring home a uruguay round agreement that is not only good for america, but great for tomorrow's entrepreneurs everywhere. the free-trade agenda for the next four years starts with the signing of a north american free trade agreement (nafta) with mexico, completing the establishment of a free-trade area which already includes canada. nafta will create the largest market in the world, greater than the european community, with million consumers and a total output of six trillion dollars. it means a net gain of hundreds of thousands of american jobs. we acknowledge the possible effects on regional markets, specifically agriculture. we encourage our negotiators to be sensitive to those market concerns. we will continue to fill the pacific rim with american exports, negotiating trade agreements with other asian economies, and will complete our efforts - such as the structural impediments initiative with japan - to reduce barriers to american goods and services. and we will continue to negotiate the enterprise for the americas initiative with latin america as a first step in creating a hemispheric free-trade zone. congress should report to the american people the cost to workers, consumers and businesses of every democrat trade restriction, trade tax or trade quota bill it considers. we will not tolerate their obstructing the greatest expansion of international trade in history. republicans welcome this opportunity; for we know america's workers, thinkers and builders will make the most of it. international economic policy. twelve years ago, we unleashed a tidal wave of freedom around the world - not just political but economic liberty as well. what works in america personal responsibility, limited government, competition - works throughout the world. because the world economy is interdependent, the united states has been affected by downturns elsewhere, particularly since with the crash of the japanese stock market and germany's economic difficulties. now, as progress resumes, the republican plan for global growth is vital for all nations, developed or otherwise. the continuing prosperity of our neighborhoods will depend in part upon the masterful diplomacy we have come to expect from president bush. economic freedom is an essential link to our foreign policy. it means expanded trade, but it also means dynamic growth based on shared values - a coming together of nations in the commonwealth of peaceful progress. to that end, u.s. aid, whether bilateral or through international organizations, should promote market reforms, limit regulation and encourage free trade. chief among these market reforms should be the privatization of state owned industries such as telecommunications, power, mining and refining. privatization should afford american companies the opportunity to purchase some of these assets, bring competition to these countries and substantially reduce our trade deficit. the united states government should take all possible steps to assist american companies wishing to invest in privatized industries by adopting policies, rules and regulations that will equitably facilitate these ventures, especially for small businesses. we will work with developing nations to make their economies attractive to private investment and will support innovations to guarantee repayment of their loans, including debt for equity swaps. our experience can help them develop environmentally rational strategies for growth. because we uphold the family as the building block of economic progress, we protect its right in international programs and will continue to withhold funds from organizations involved in abortion. most important, we encourage developing nations to adopt both democracy and free markets. the two are inextricably tied and afford all people the greatest opportunities. reforming government and the legal system two centuries ago, the american people created a miracle - a system of government, founded on limited authority and the rule of law, a system that made government the servant of the people. today it is in shambles. citizens feel overwhelmed by vast bureaucracies. congress insulates incumbents from public judgment. huge problems get worse while committee chairmen play partisan games. the current legal system tends to breed delay, cost, confusion and jargon - everything but justice. many of our once-great cities are controlled by one-party machines that promote and encourage corruption and incompetence. the republic has not failed; the democratic party bosses failed the republic. the republican party, now as at its founding, challenges a debased status quo. in congress, the states, our cities, our courtrooms, we fight for the basics of self-government. we rely on what works, judging programs by how well they do instead of how much they spend. the democrats believe in more government. republicans believe in leaner, more effective government. we decentralize authority, returning decisions to states, localities and private institutions. the democrat bosses want to concentrate power on capitol hill. republicans place it in town halls and the american home. republicans favor the free-enterprise system. we choose market forces - consumer rights - over red tape. the democrats argue that government must constantly override the market. republicans regard the worst market failure as the failure to have a market. we replace dependency with empowerment. the democrats see an america filled with wards of the state. republicans see an america peopled by citizens and consumers eager for the chance to chart their own course. we make electoral systems understandable and accountable to the voter. the democrats fear proposals that would limit the tenure and hidden power of incumbent politicians. republicans want the ballot box to prevail over the cloakroom. cleaning up the imperial congress. the democrats have controlled the house of representatives for years - five years longer than castro has held cuba. they have held the senate for of those . their entrenched power has produced a congress arrogant, out of touch, hopelessly entangled in a web of pacs, perks, privileges, partisanship, paralysis and pork. no wonder they hid their congressional leaders during the democrat convention of . they didn't want americans to remember who has been running the congress. the democrats have transformed what the framers of the constitution intended as the people's house into a pathological institution. they have grossly increased their staffing, their payrolls, their allied bureaucracies in little-known congressional agencies. congress has ballooned to congressional committees and subcommittees, almost , legislative branch employees and staff, and $. billion in taxpayer financing, amounting to approximately $ million per lawmaker per year. incumbents have abused free mailing privileges for personal political gain. twenty two democrats, with a total of years in power, rule over a committee system that blocks every attempt at reform. the democrats have trampled the traditions of the house, rigging rules, forbidding votes on crucial amendments, denying fair apportionment of committee seats and resources. they have stacked campaign laws to benefit themselves. the democrat leadership of the house has been tainted with scandal and has resisted efforts to investigate scandals once disclosed. some in their leadership have resigned in well-earned disgrace. the democrat leadership of the congress has turned the healthy competition of constitutional separation of powers into mean-spirited politics of innuendo and inquisition. committee hearings are no longer for fact-finding; they are political sideshows. ""advise and consent"" has been replaced by ""slash and burn."" republicans want to change all that. we reaffirm our support for a constitutional amendment to limit the number of terms house members and senators may serve. we want a citizens' congress, free of bloated pensions and perpetual perks. congress must stop exempting itself from laws such as the minimum wage and the civil rights statutes, as well as laws that apply to the executive branch. the independent counsel act is a case in point. it has permitted rogue prosecutors to spend tremendous amounts to hound some of the nation's finest public servants. if that act is reauthorized, it must be extended to congress as well. safety and health regulations, civil rights and minimum wage laws are further examples of areas where congress has set itself apart from the people. this practice must end. congress must slash its own bureaucracy. its employees operate in a maze of overlapping jurisdictions. a republican congress will cut expenses by percent, reduce the number of committees and subcommittees, and assign staff in accurate proportion to party strength. we will restore integrity to the house of representatives, reforming its rules, allowing open debate and amendment. the committee system, both in congress and in democrat-controlled state legislatures, has been abused by chairpersons who have arbitrarily killed legislation that would have passed. committees are a place for open and free discussion, not a closet for democrats to stash republican legislation. democracy itself is endangered by these abuses, and republicans condemn those practices. both houses of congress must guarantee protection to whistleblowers to encourage employees to report illegality, corruption, sexual harassment and discrimination. the democrat rulers of congress have blocked or stalled presidential initiatives in many areas, including education, housing, crime control, economic recovery, job creation and budget reform. they care more about scoring petty partisan points for themselves and their party than about achieving real progress for the nation. to accomplish change, we need a change in congress. reforming the congressional budget process. at the heart of the democrats' corruption of congress is a fraudulent budget process. they do not want the public to understand how they spend the public's money. at a time when the nation's future depends on reduction of deficits, the lords of the capitol still play the old shell game. republicans vigorously support a balanced budget, a balanced budget constitutional amendment and a line-item veto for the president. republicans believe this balancing of the budget should be achieved, not by increasing taxes to match spending, but by cutting spending to current levels of revenue. we prefer a balanced-budget amendment that contains a supermajority requirement to raise taxes. we also propose procedural reforms. we support legislation that would require congress to pass a legally binding budget before it can consider spending bills. the budget's spending ceilings shall not be exceeded without a supermajority vote of both chambers. if congress fails to pass any appropriation bill, funding for its programs will automatically be frozen at the previous year's level. the key to prosperity for the rest of this century and for the next generation of americans is a budget strategy that restores sanity to the budget process and checks the growth of government. congress should be forced to confront basic arithmetic through truth in counting. the democrats measure all changes in funding against a ""current services baseline,"" with built-in increases for inflation and other factors. if they want a $ million program to grow to $ million, they then count an increase to $. million as a half-million dollar cut. this is the accounting system of wonderland, where words mean exactly what the democrat speaker says they mean. the double-talk must end with zero based budgeting. we also support ""sunset laws"" that require government agencies to be reviewed periodically and reauthorized only if they can be rejustified. cleaning up politics: the gerrymander. after more than a half-century of distortion by power-hungry democrats, the political system is increasingly rigged. throughout the 1980s, voters were cheated out of dozens of seats in the house of representatives and in state legislatures because districts were oddly shaped to guarantee election of democrats. it was swindle by law. we support state-level appointment of nonpartisan redistricting commissions to apply clear standards for compactness of districts, competitiveness between the parties and protection of community interests. cleaning up politics: campaign reform. we crusade for clean elections. we support state efforts to increase voter participation but condemn democrat attempts to perpetrate vote fraud through schemes that override the state's safeguards of orderly voter registration. and it is critical that the states retain the authority to tailor voter registration procedures to unique local circumstances. most of all, we condemn the democrats' shameless plots to make taxpayers foot the bills for their campaigns. their campaign finance bill would have given $ billion, over six years, in subsidies to candidates. president bush vetoed that bill. campaign financing does need reform. it does not need a hand in the public's pocketbook. we will require congressional candidates to raise most of their funds from individuals within their home constituencies. this will limit outside special-interest money and result in less expensive campaigns, with less padding for incumbents. to the same end, we will strengthen the role of political parties to remove pressure on candidates to spend so much time soliciting funds. we will eliminate political action committees supported by corporations, unions or trade associations, and restrict the practice of bundling. to restore competition in elections by attacking the unfair advantages of incumbency, we will stop incumbents from warding off challengers merely by amassing huge war chests. congressional candidates will be forbidden from carrying campaign funds from one election to the next. we will oppose arbitrary spending limits - cynical devices which hobble challengers to keep politicians in office. we will fully implement the supreme court's decision in the beck case, ensuring that workers have the right to stop the use of their union dues for political or other non-collective bargaining purposes. managing government in the public interest. the focus of government must shift from quantity to quality, from spending to service. americans should expect measurable, published standards for services provided by government at all levels. performance standards and rules, commonplace in the private sector, must be applied to government activities as well. because federal government employees should not be a privileged caste, we will remove the bar to garnishing their wages to ensure payment of their debts. the quality revolution in american business has quietly but profoundly transformed american culture over the past decade. millions of american workers have benefited from the more cooperative spirit the quality revolution has brought to tens of thousands of workplaces; and every american has benefited from the lower costs, higher quality service and greater level of competitiveness it has produced. republicans are proud to have played a leading role in this transformation, especially through the annual malcolm baldrige national quality award, which recognizes companies that best represent the principles of quality. the quality revolution in the private sector, with its concepts of continuous improvement, profound knowledge and ""doing the right thing right the first time,"" stands in stark contrast to the outmoded practices, insensitivity and outright waste, abuse and corruption endemic in the bureaucratic welfare state. the republican party is firmly committed to bringing the quality revolution into government at every level by creating a ""quality workers for a quality america"" coalition whose aim will be to transform the bureaucratic welfare state into a government that is customer-friendly, cost-effective and improving constantly. privatization is an important alternative to higher taxes and reduced services. if private enterprise can perform better and more cheaply than government, let it do so. this is especially true of properties now decaying under government control, such as public housing, where residents should have the option to manage their own projects. these citizens should have the chance to become stockholders and managers of government enterprises and to run them more efficiently as private enterprises. we applaud president bush's initiative to allow states and localities to privatize facilities built with federal aid. where it advances both efficiency and safety, we will advocate privatization of airport operation and management. we deplore the blatant political bias of the governmentsponsored radio and television networks. it is especially outrageous that taxpayers are now forced to underwrite this biased broadcasting through the corporation for public broadcasting (cpb). we call for sweeping reform of cpb, including greater accountability through application of the freedom of information act, a one-year funding cycle and enforcement of rigorous fairness standards for all cpb-supported programming. we look forward to the day when public broadcasting is self-sufficient. always trusting the initiative of the american people over the ways of government, we will not initiate production of goods or delivery of services by the federal government if they can be procured from the private sector. we will not initiate any federal activity that can be conducted better on the state or local level. in doing so, we reassert the crucial importance of the 10th amendment. we oppose costly federal mandates that stifle innovation and force tax hikes upon states and localities. we require that congress calculate the cost of mandated initiatives upon communities affected and provide adequate financial support for mandates invoked. we will continue the process of returning power to local voters by replacing federal programs with block grants. reforming the legal system. the united states, with percent of the world's population, has two thirds of the world's lawyers. litigation has become an industry, an end in itself. the number of civil cases in federal district courts has more than tripled in the past years. it now takes more than a year to resolve the average lawsuit. delays of three to five years are commonplace. the current legal system forces consumers to pay higher prices for everything from basic goods to medical treatment. direct litigation and inflated insurance premiums sock american consumers for an estimated $ billion a year. all told, our legal system costs, directly and indirectly, $ billion a year. what it costs us in the world marketplace, by hindering our competitiveness, is beyond calculation. we therefore endorse the president's proposals for legal reform as developed by vice president quayle, and we salute his principled challenge to the american bar association to clean up its own house. we support the fairness rule, to allow the winning party to a lawsuit to recover the costs of litigation from the losing party. this will discourage needless suits, freeing legal resources for people with genuine cases. we believe complainants should have a choice of ways to settle problems through alternative dispute programs that will permit parties to pursue less costly and less complicated ways to resolve conflicts. we also call for greater use of judicial sanctions to stop frivolous lawsuits. we call for changes to the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations (rico) law to limit its use in civil litigation by requiring proof of all elements by clear and convincing proof. we seek to restore fairness and predictability to punitive damages by placing appropriate limits on them, dividing trials into two phases to determine liability separately from damages and requiring clear proof of wrongdoing. this will go a long way to reduce insurance premiums for professional and product liability and for all malpractice, including medical, thereby lowering costs for consumers throughout the economy, while preserving the ability of injured persons to obtain damages. it will also foster the creation of new products for the american marketplace, perhaps cures for the diseases we most fear. the republican party commends president bush and vice president quayle for their continued leadership in helping volunteers overcome their concern that their good acts and voluntary donations of time on behalf of civic groups, community organizations and churches will result in civil liability and lawsuits. we encourage the state legislatures to pass the administration's model bill, ""the volunteerism act."" we will throw out ""junk science"" by requiring courts to verify the legitimacy of persons called as expert witnesses. to restore integrity to courtroom testimony, we will ban the practice of paying fees to experts only if a successful verdict is obtained. we will maintain diversity jurisdiction for citizens of different states to ensure access to the federal courts when appropriate. because four-fifths of the time and cost of a lawsuit involves discovery - pretrial investigation of the facts - we will require automatic disclosure, by both sides, of basic information. we will ban abuses of the discovery process used to intimidate opponents and drive up their costs. we will fight rising health-care costs - and equally important, help dedicated doctors to keep practicing in critical areas like obstetrics - by providing incentives for states to reform their liability laws. this will reduce the practice of ""defensive medicine,"" requiring patients to be tested for every conceivable ailment at their own enormous expense to guard against the mere possibility of a lawsuit. recognizing that legal reform can solve only parts of the larger problem, we support a federal product liability law. the cost of product liability protection is a great expense to the american consumer and seriously impedes our international competitiveness. for example, a consumer pays an additional percent to cover the liability insurance of an ordinary stepladder. if european nations can enact uniform product liability laws to give them a competitive edge against the united states, we can do it here, too - once we break the democrat hold on the congress so republicans can put the interests of workers and consumers ahead of trial lawyers. some of the problems in our legal system are rooted in a declining sense of, and respect for, individual responsibility. we reaffirm that all americans are first and finally responsible for their own behavior. the nation's capital. we call for closer and responsible congressional scrutiny of the city, federal oversight of its law enforcement and courts, and tighter fiscal restraints over its expenditures. we oppose statehood as inconsistent with the original intent of the framers of the constitution and with the need for a federal city belonging to all the people as our nation's capital. a new era for the territories. we welcome greater participation in all aspects of the political process by americans residing in guam, the virgin islands, american samoa, the northern marianas and puerto rico. because territorial america is far-flung and divergent, we know that any single approach to the future will not necessarily meet the needs of all. republicans therefore emphasize respect for the wishes of those who reside in the territories regarding their relationship to the rest of the union. we affirm the right of american citizens in the united states territories to seek the full extension of the constitution with the accompanying rights and responsibilities, and we support all necessary legislation to permit them to do so. the republican party supports the right of the united states citizens of puerto rico to be admitted to the union as a fully sovereign state after they freely so determine. we recognize that the people of guam have voted for a closer relationship with the united states of america, and we reaffirm our support of their right to mutually improve their political relationship through commonwealth. we support american samoa's efforts to advance toward economic self reliance through a multi-year plan, while ensuring the protection afforded to the people of american samoa by the original treaty of cession. we support the full extension of rights and responsibilities under the u.s. constitution to american citizens of the virgin islands. we commend president bush for the successful development of self government in micronesia and the marshall islands and for efforts to conclude the united nations' last trusteeship in palau consistent with the people's right of self-determination. our land, food and resources we hold the resources of our country in stewardship. our heritage from the past must be our legacy to generations to come. our people have always known that, as they cherished their land and turned earth and rock into food, fiber and power. in the process, they built the world's most formidable economy, sustained by its raw materials, driven by its energy resources. they brought comfort to the home, transformed the nation and fed the world. agriculture and energy remain building blocks of modern life. their vitality is crucial to the nation's growth. indeed, to its survival. while supporting conservation, we reject the notion that there are limits to growth. human ingenuity is the ultimate resource, and it knows no limits. the true measure of america's economic success is not whether austerity can be shared by many, but whether prosperity can be achieved for all. we advocate privatizing those government agencies and assets that would be more productive and better maintained in private ownership. we support efforts to decentralize government monopolies that poorly serve the public and waste taxpayers' dollars. agriculture. the republican party is the home of the farmer, rancher and forester. we have long championed their right to pursue growth, efficiency and competitiveness through market incentives, diversification and personal ingenuity. and for good reason. their industry provides consumers with the highestquality food and fiber for the smallest percentage of disposable income of any nation in the history of the world. they have been pioneer environmentalists. they have turned over to their children and grandchildren land that has been nurtured to expand its productivity while conserving this vital resource. even more important, they have cultivated in their homes strong family life and moral virtues. we endorse american samoa's time-honored land tenure system, which fosters self-reliance and strong extended family values. when we lose farmers, we lose much more than agriculture. we are committed to bringing our farm families the full benefit of a growing and diversified rural economy. our rural families also deserve to be brought into the mainstream of health care, with tax policies that provide all who are self-employed full deductibility of their health insurance premiums. we stand with farmers against attempts by liberal democrats to repeal the laws of economics by dictating price levels and restricting production. we stand with them against agriculture embargoes. we reject the notion that elected officials and bureaucrats make better farm managers than farmers themselves. we remain strong in our support of livestock agriculture. we believe in the humane treatment of animals, but we oppose attempts by animal rights extremists to impose excessive restrictions on animal husbandry practices. our omnibus farm bills of and gave farmers greater flexibility in decisions concerning management of their farms and marketing of their commodities. we have reduced government control and ownership of commodity inventories. export sales and profitability have improved significantly. agricultural debt has fallen by percent. under this president and sound republican policies, net farm income has reached record levels. at the same time, we cut by two-thirds the cost of government commodity programs. only one-half of percent of the federal budget is now spent on those programs. by reducing dependency on government, we have created a healthier agricultural sector. we will build upon our and legislation and repeal obsolete or unworkable statues while continuing to provide a viable base of support for u.s. farmers. agricultural prosperity is essential to the nation's global competitiveness. we will continue to expand the growth of american agriculture through exports, development of new products and new markets. commodity exports this year will hit $ billion, a percent increase over the levels of five years ago. there has never been an annual deficit in our balance of agricultural trade, and the positive balance this year will be $ billion. we pledge to fight unfair competition and to bring down the walls of protectionism around the world that unfairly inhibit competitiveness of u.s. farm exports. we pledge continued pressure to open world markets through the uruguay round, the north american free trade agreement and bilateral negotiations. we affirm that there will be no gatt agreement unless it improves opportunities for u.s. farmers to compete in world markets. we repeat our demands for cutbacks in export subsidies by the european community and elsewhere, and we will fight the use of arbitrary health and sanitation standards to sabotage u.s. exports. new markets for agricultural products will also be created as producers translate technological breakthroughs into new uses, such as soy oil diesel and biodegradable plastics. we support the widest possible use of ethanol in the u.s. motor fuel market, including in oxygenated fuels programs and as ethanol blends in reformulated gasolines. in addition, the republican party supports increased research and development to reduce ethanol production costs and expand its use in motor fuel markets. such use will greatly help american farmers, improve the rural economy and reduce our dependence on imported oil. building our farm economy requires meeting our farmers' financing needs. critical to these needs are competitive, reasonable interests rates for u.s. producers. under george bush, interest rates have been dramatically reduced, thereby contributing substantially to improving the net income of american farm and ranch families. we will continue working to ensure that farmers have access to credit, with particular consideration to the needs of young and beginning farmers. we recognize the importance of efficient, equitable transportation systems to the economic viability of agricultural exports; and we will work to achieve greater efficiencies within the u.s. maritime industry and to decrease the cost to agriculture of shipping services. we support farm conservation efforts, both those pioneered in our farm bill and entirely voluntary undertakings, which result in three times as much erosion control as those mandated by law. we support the conservation reserve, with more than million acres now enrolled. it shows what farmers can do through incentives rather than government controls. we value our nation's real wetlands habitat and the diversity of our native animal and plant life. we oppose, however, bureaucratic harassment of farm, ranch and timber families under statutes regarding endangered species and wetlands. when actions are required to protect an endangered species, we recognize that jobs can be lost, communities displaced and economic progress for all denied. accordingly, prior to the implementation of a recovery plan for a species declared to be endangered, we will require the congress to affirm the priority of the species on the endangered list and the specific measures to be taken in any recovery plan. these acts should not rest with the rubber stamp of a bureaucrat. with regard to wetlands, following our principle that environmental protection be reasonable, land that is not truly wet would not be classified as a wetland. protection of environmentally sensitive wetlands must not come at the price of disparaging landowners' property rights. thus, we endorse, as president bush has done, legislation to discourage government activities that ignore property rights. we also find intolerable the use of taxpayer funds, through the legal services corporation, to attack the agricultural community. power for progress. energy sustains life as we know it: our standard of living, the prospect for economic growth, the way our children will live in the century ahead. republican energy policy, now as in the past, reflects the common-sense aspirations of the american people. our goals address our fundamental needs: an energy supply, available to all, that remains reasonably priced, secure and clean, produced by strong energy industries on which the country can rely, operating in an environmentally responsible manner and producing from domestically available energy resources to the maximum extent practicable. anyone older than a teenager can remember the energy upheavals of the bad old days, when political games threw the nation into a tailspin. stranded in gasoline lines, shocked by home heating bills, shutting down factory operations, america's motorists, homeowners and workers rightly blamed official washington for wrecking something that had always worked so efficiently that it was taken for granted. today, after years of republican reform, we can again have confidence in our energy policies. the average household spends percent less on energy, as adjusted for inflation, than it did in , because of both conservation and lower costs. we broke the shackles of bureaucratic regulation by ending petroleum price and allocation controls, deregulating natural gas wellhead prices, and repealing restrictions on the use of clean-burning natural gas by industry and utilities. we repealed the windfall profit tax on crude oil that penalized investment in domestic oil production. we promoted free competition in an open marketplace and ended the public subsidy to the synthetic fuels program. and we broke the back of opec, the international energy cartel. and, equally important, we undertook a re-evaluation of estimates of our domestic energy resource base, which the carter administration had determined to be inadequate. the republican administration correctly found that we can indeed continue to supply a significant amount of our domestically available energy resources, including natural gas and coal, for all energy consumption needs well into the next century. when iraq's dictator moved to seize the world's energy lifeline by controlling the persian gulf, george bush did more than liberate kuwait. he prevented an energy crisis and economic shutdown in america. now his national energy strategy leads toward continued growth in the century ahead. it provides the nation with a comprehensive and balanced strategy for america's energy future. specifically, it promotes adequate energy supplies and reduces consumer costs by relying on market forces, diversifying domestic energy sources and improving the efficiency and flexibility of energy consumption. we seek to foster greater competition and increased output, in the interest of producers and consumers alike. the domestic oil and gas industry saves us from total dependence on unreliable foreign imports. but over the past decade, it has lost more than , jobs. drilling rigs are still. crippled by environmental rules and taxes, independent producers have been devastated and major companies are moving operations overseas. we will reverse that situation by allowing access, under environmental safeguards, to the coastal plain of the arctic national wildlife refuge, possibly one of the largest petroleum reserves in our country, and to selected areas of the outer continental shelf (ocs). we support incentives to encourage domestic investment for onshore and ocs oil and gas exploration and development, including relief from the alternative minimum tax, credits for enhanced oil recovery and geological exploration under known geological oil fields and producing geological structures, and modified percentage depletion rules to benefit marginal production. we will ensure that royalty payments on federal lands remain consistent with changing economic conditions. most important, unlike democrat no-growth fanatics, we know what is most at stake in the energy debate: the family's standard of living, including job opportunities, household income and the environment in which we live. that is why we have been supporting complete decontrol of wellhead prices for clean natural gas, which have already declined percent in the last four years while consumption increased by the same amount. we support replacing government controls with the power of the market to determine transactions between buyers and sellers of natural gas. we encourage the use of natural gas for both vehicles and electricity generation, and the expansion of research, development and demonstration for enduse natural gas technologies. we will foster more public-private partnerships to advance use of natural gas. the republican party has a deep and abiding commitment to america's mining industry. we support the original intent of the mining law of : to provide the security necessary for miners to risk capital investment on federal lands, thus preserving jobs and bolstering the domestic economy. we support clean coal technologies to allow greater use of america's most abundant fossil fuel within standards required by the clean air act. we encourage the export of u.s. coal. we support acceleration of the international transfer of coalrelated technologies to boost exports for u.s. coal, in order to capitalize on america's leadership in these technologies. we oppose any attempt to impose a carbon tax as proposed by liberal democrats. we endorse major national projects, like the superconducting super collider, which offer the promise of developing more efficient ways to store, transport and use energy. we will hasten development of the next generation of nuclear power plants - one of the cleanest, safest energy sources of all. republicans back reform of the nuclear licensing process. we will site and license a permanent waste depository and a monitored retrievable storage facility. we reject the scare tactics used against nuclear power by those who want to shut down this essential contributor to the american future. we endorse development of renewable energy sources and research on fuel cells, conservation, hydro, solar, hydrogren and wind power as components of our overall plan for energy security and environmental quality. public lands. the millions of acres that constitute this nation's public lands must continue to provide for a number of uses. we are committed to the multiple use of our public lands. we believe that recreation, forestry, ranching, mining, oil and gas exploration, and production on our public lands can be conducted in a way compatible with their conservation. the united states has some of the richest mineral resources in the world. our public lands should not be arbitrarily locked up and put off limits to responsible uses. approximately percent of the lands in the west are owned by the federal government. these lands are a deeply intermingled patchwork built of public and private ownership. in order to provide an economic base for the people of the west, a publicprivate cooperative partnership on these lands for multiple use in an environmentally sound manner is imperative. transportation. from its founding, the republican party has considered the nation's transportation system crucial to economic opportunity for all. that is why our platform endorsed the transcontinental railroad. it is why president eisenhower signed the interstate and defense highway act, bringing america closer together and launching a lengthy economic expansion. today, america's transportation system is safer, more efficient, more reliable than that of any other country. it employs one of every workers and accounts for $ billion in spending. it enables us to compete in the world market and gives us more choices in our daily lives. under president bush, that system has been strengthened by revolutionary legislation to pave the way into the century ahead. providing $ billion for highways and transit systems, it is the most extensive transportation improvement project in our nation's history - and a tremendous jobs program as well. highway death rates have dropped to an all-time low, largely due to better road design and stronger safety programs. this progress would be wiped out by the democrats' draconian plan for higher corporate average fuel economy (cafe) standards. their national nominees want to require a miles-per-gallon standard. that means unsafe vehicles, reduced consumer choice, higher car costs and a loss of , jobs in the auto industry here at home. to reduce the congestion that still chokes urban areas, we established a national highway system of , miles, giving states and localities greater voice in decisions about projects. it will improve connections between ports and highways, airports and railways; spur development of new airports and reduce their environmental impact; promote private investment in transportation; and foster high-tech solutions to congestion. to keep america on the move, we assert the same principle that guides us in all other sectors of the economy: consumers benefit through competition within the private sector. that is why we will complete the job of trucking deregulation. we will also abolish the interstate commerce commission, finally freeing shippers and consumers from horse-and-buggy regulation. we applaud the president's executive order that will assist communities to privatize government-controlled ventures, such as airports and toll roads. our tough trade campaign, along with regulatory reforms, will assure u.s. air carriers fair access to international routes and allow the u.s. merchant marine to sail over foreign protectionism. the president has proposed and will aggressively pursue a comprehensive revision of existing maritime policy. regulatory reform of airlines now allows more people to fly more safely, at better prices. tough laws for drug and alcohol testing are making all modes of transportation safer than ever. disabled persons will have greater access to the entire transportation network under the americans with disabilities act. wherever possible, the market should allocate investment in transportation, steering the development of passenger rail, mass transit and highways to best suit consumers. states and localities should have discretion in using highway trust fund revenues to construct new roads, expand existing ones or invest in mass transit facilities, as they see fit. we advocate development of high-speed rail systems, through private investment, to serve intercity travel. we also advocate development of short-haul aircraft with vertical takeoff and landing capability, to bring commerce and jobs to communities large and small. we will continue aggressively to support development of intelligent highway systems, an efficient battery for electric cars, perfected natural gas vehicles, greater private investment in space travel and removal of regulatory impediments to intermodal transport. because republicans advocate personal responsibility, we salute groups, organizations and individuals that take direct action to improve safe driving and street safety. environment. cleaning up america is a labor of love for family, neighborhood and the nation. in the republican tradition of conserving the past to enrich the future, we have made the united states the world's leader in environmental progress. we spend more than any other country on environmental protection. over the last years, our country has spent $ trillion to clean its air, water and land. we increased gnp by percent while cutting lead in the air by percent. our rivers run cleaner than ever in memory. we've preserved parks, wilderness and wildlife. the price of progress is now about $ billion a year, almost percent of gnp; and that will grow to percent by . clearly we have led the world in investment in environmental protection. we have taught the world three vital lessons. first, environmental progress is integrally related to economic advancement. second, economic growth generates the capital to pay for environmental gains. third, private ownership and economic freedom are the best security against environmental degradation. the ghastly truth about state socialism is now exposed in what used to be the soviet union: dead rivers and seas, poisoned land, dying people. liberal democrats think people are the problem. we know people are the solution. respecting the people's rights and views, we applied market based solutions to environmental problems. president bush's landmark clean air act amendments of , the toughest environmental law ever enacted, uses an innovative system of emission credits to achieve its dramatic reductions. this will save $ billion over the democrats' command-and-control approach. other provisions of that law will cut acid rain emissions in half, reduce toxic pollutants by percent, reduce smog and speed the use of cleaner fuels. the president's leadership has doubled spending for real wetlands and targeted million acres for a wetlands reserve through his farm bill of . we have collected more civil penalties from polluters in two years than in the previous , begun the phaseout of substances that harm the ozone layer and launched a long-term campaign to expand and improve national parks, forests and recreation areas, adding . million acres. president bush has dramatically increased spending for cleaning up past environmental damage caused by federal facilities. our reforestation drive will plant billion trees a year across america. our moratorium on offshore drilling in sensitive offshore areas has bought time for technology to master environmental challenges. our farm policies have begun a new era in sound agricultural environmentalism. because the environment knows no boundaries, president bush has accelerated u.s. research on global climate change, spending $. billion in the last three years and requesting $. billion for , more than the rest of the world put together. under his leadership, we have assisted nations from the third world to eastern europe in correcting the environmental damage inflicted by socialism. we proposed a worldwide forestry convention and gave almost half a billion dollars to forest conservation. we won debt-for-nature swaps and environmental trust funds in latin america and the caribbean. we secured prohibitions against unilateral export or dumping of hazardous waste. we led the international ban on trade in ivory, persuaded japan to end drift net fishing, streamlined response to oil spills and increased environmental protection for antarctica. adverse changes in climate must be the common concern of mankind. at the same time, we applaud our president for personally confronting the international bureaucrats at the rio conference. he refused to accept their anti-american demands for income redistribution and won instead a global climate treaty that relies on real action plans rather than arbitrary targets hostile to u.s. growth and workers. following his example, a republican senate will not ratify any treaty that moves environmental decisions beyond our democratic process or transfers beyond our shores authority over u.s. property. the democrats' national candidates, on the other hand, insist the united states must do what our foreign competitors refuse to do: abolish , to ,, jobs to get a modest reduction in ""greenhouse gases."" environmental progress must continue in tandem with economic growth. crippling an industry is no solution at all. bankrupt facilities only worsen environmental situations. unemployment is a form of pollution too, poisoning families and contaminating whole communities. some in our own country still refuse to face those facts. they try to hijack environmentalism, making it anti-growth and anti-jobs. although the average family of four now pays $, a year for environmental controls, liberal democrats want to tighten the squeeze. they use junk science to foster hysteria instead of reason, demanding rigid controls, more taxes and less resource production. however, with billions of dollars at stake in national production and jobs, not to mention our quality of life, our decisions to spend on environmental protection must not be determined by the politics of the moment. we will use scientifically respectable risk-benefit assessments to settle environmental controversies. it is time to replace knee-jerk reactions with the kind of scientific analysis that helps businesses, individuals and communities contribute to economic and environmental progress through flexible application of laws. we must base our environmental policies on real risks to human health, determined by sound, peer-reviewed science, including procedures for what is an acceptable risk. we will require federal agencies to promptly compensate, from their own budgets, for any taking of private property, including the denial of use. we will legislatively overhaul the ""superfund"" program to speed the cleanup of hazardous waste and more efficiently use superfund dollars. we will develop greenways of parks and open space in urban areas to further improve the quality of life in our cities. we will work with u.s. industry and labor to identify promising markets abroad where america's environmental know-how can carry our success story to the rest of planet earth. private property rights. we reaffirm our commitment to the fifth amendment to the constitution: ""no person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."" we support strong enforcement of this takings clause to keep citizens secure in the use and development of their property. the right to own, use and dispose of property inheres in mankind by nature and is a fundamental political tenet of all free nations. we applaud the wisdom of the first congress for incorporating this guarantee of individual liberty in the bill of rights. we remind all government officials that property rights are not granted by government; rather, government is directed by the governed to protect the rights of private property owners. the vigilant protection of private property rights safeguards for citizens everything of value, including their right of contract to produce and sell the fruits of their labor. the historic collapse of communism and other command-and-control economies is absolute evidence of the failure of economic systems that lack a recognition of the natural rights of property owners. we also seek to reduce the amount of land owned or controlled by the government, especially in the western states. we insist upon prompt payment for private lands certified as critical for preserving essential parks and preserves. uniting our world the triumph of freedom the world is now our neighborhood. its triumphs and tragedies affect our communities, our jobs and the security of our families. that is why republicans want america to shape the international future: because we put america first. not everyone does. just years ago, the forces of freedom were in tattered retreat. a failed foreign policy by a democrat white house and democrat-controlled congress had left our allies uncertain, our friends betrayed, our foes emboldened. it was a frightening era, in some ways the worst of times. we all remember the flickering television images of blindfolded americans being degraded by thugs. when voters make their choice in this year's elections, they should ask themselves: are we safer and stronger today, in , than we were in , when jimmy carter was the democrat president? republicans are proud to answer those questions. the nation's international position has not just improved since the democrats left office. it has been transformed. never in this century has the united states enjoyed such security from foreign enemies. with president bush leading the free world, the soviet empire has collapsed, as ronald reagan predicted, into the dustbin of history. eastern europe is liberated. germany is peacefully united. the former soviet armies are returning home. nuclear arsenals are being cut to fractions of their former size. a democratically elected russian president sits in the kremlin. ukraine, armenia and the baltic states take their rightful place among the family of nations. israel and all of its arab neighbors talk face to face for the first time. nicaragua and panama celebrate democracy. it might very well not have turned out this way. only the naive believe that history is an inevitable tide or a series of accidents. our crusade of a half-century, to champion freedom and civilization against the dark night of totalitarianism, is now victorious. an american president led the free world to this great triumph. george bush was that man. freedom's victory begins a new chapter in the epic of america, full of both promise and peril. this different and unpredictable world demands visionary, experienced leadership, tested and strengthened, careful and cool. at stake is nothing less than our security, our prosperity and our children's future. americans can trust president bush with that awesome responsibility. the triumph of freedom no other president in the long history of our country has achieved so many of the enduring objectives of american foreign policy in so short a time as has george bush. he made it look easy, even destined. it was neither. building on the legacy of ronald reagan, george bush saw the chance to sweep away decadent communism. he was the first western leader to declare his determination to fashion ""a europe whole and free."" he took the free world beyond containment, led the way in aiding democracy in eastern europe and punched holes through the rusting iron curtain. we all remember the joy we felt when we saw the people of berlin dancing on top of the crumbling wall that had symbolized four decades of communist oppression. he championed germany's right to become again one nation and orchestrated the diplomacy to make it happen, on western terms, in one astounding year. foreseeing revolutionary change in the soviet union itself, he carefully pushed its rules to open the way to the democratic future. when crisis came, in august , george bush, in the words of boris yeltsin, ""was the first to understand the true meaning of the victory of the russian people"" and gave his decisive backing to the cause of democracy. the world had never before faced the disintegration of a nuclear superpower. today, thanks in large part to president bush's initiatives, nuclear weapons are found in only four countries of the former soviet union - not . because of his efforts, all but russia are giving up any claim to these weapons, and russia has agreed to destroy the most dangerous missiles ever built. the balance of terror is fading away. the ideals of liberty, both political and economic, are the dominant moral and intellectual force around the globe. george bush made it happen. yet now that we have won the cold war, we must also win the peace. we must not repeat the mistake of the past by throwing away victory through complacency. a new world beckons, unlike any we have ever known, filled with uncertainties. old passions have re-emerged. new democracies struggle to decide their destiny. nations are torn asunder. migrants and refugees strain the social fabric of continents. tyrants work to build nuclear, chemical and even biological weapons to threaten us and our neighbors. drug trafficking and terrorism, often linked, menace americans at home and abroad. great transitions in world affairs are rarely tidy. they challenge statesmanship, require steadiness and wisdom. history teaches that when the united states shrinks from the world, we hasten the emergence of new dangers. republicans remember the lesson taught by our founders: that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. meeting the challenge. the gulf war showed the world how much is at stake when voters choose their president. george bush had known war firsthand. so he tried the way of peace - months of negotiations and economic sanctions - then did what a president must do. he led from powerful convictions based on american values. the united states, in a pre-eminent position of world leadership, forged a new strategy of collective engagement which invigorated the united nations. this was not the same united states held hostage in , when the democrats controlled both the white house and the congress. no helpless giant here. the president charted a path that wrecked saddam hussein's dreams of conquest and nuclear aggression while keeping america from the quagmire of indefinite military occupation of iraq. president bush, trusting the military commanders he had chosen, was commander-in-chief of one of the finest achievements in the distinguished history of our armed forces. americans will never forget that, of the congressional democrats, only voted to support operation desert storm and voted to oppose it. if the democrats had prevailed, saddam hussein would still be in kuwait, armed with nuclear weapons. everyone discovered what difference a vote for president can make. leadership through partnership. a new era demands a new agenda. our post-cold war strategy both reflects our country's ideals and guards its interests. building a commonwealth of freedom differs greatly from the old concept of containment. it rests on a stable balance of power but goes beyond it to emphasize, above all, the supremacy of an idea: a common conception of how to make freedom work for all the nations moving with us into a radically changing future. republicans understand that objective cannot be pursued by the united states alone. we therefore have harnessed the free world's strength to american leadership. but such a strategy requires a president whose lead others will trust and follow. by forging consensus whenever possible, we multiply the impact of our nation's power and principles. but if necessary we will act alone to protect american interests. consistent with our policy and traditions, we oppose any actions that would undermine america's sovereignty, either in political or economic terms. leadership through partnership allows us to project american ideals and project american interests abroad, at less cost to our taxpayers. that is how we will secure the victory of democracy as the best guarantee of a world without war. it is how we will open the world for american business to ensure prosperity in an open international economy. and it is how we will banish the nuclear nightmare, limit the danger from weapons of mass destruction and safely manage a critical transition in our nation's defenses. securing the victory of democracy. the spread of democracy and economic liberty is the best guarantee of peace. it can mean speaking out or applying economic pressure to encourage peaceful change; aiding democratic forces; or being ready, as a last resort, to take military action where vital american interests are at stake, as when president bush restored the rule of law to panama. republican presidents have used all these tools in a comprehensive, consistent campaign to promote democracy worldwide. new tests lie ahead. on past occasions, the tide of liberty has ebbed as dictators recaptured much of what they had lost. we want freedom's wave to roll on to reach countries like china, cuba, north korea, vietnam and others. we want to keep drawing attention to serious human rights violations around the world, spurring other governments to make and fulfill the promise of liberty to their people. we want to prevent any new ideology of authoritarianism from drawing any of the world's people to a grim and vengeful vision of our future. this is the challenge we face in the next four years. it is why president bush led the way in promoting assistance to the fledgling democracies of eastern europe. it is why he has persuaded congress to invest in the democratic future of nations reborn from communism. to the peoples of those nations, and to the russian people in particular, we declare: if you stay on the path to freedom, we stand ready to help. we rejoice especially with the people of latvia, lithuania and estonia, whose nationhood we have always upheld in law and in our hearts. in western europe, we reaffirm the nato alliance. while we reduce our troop commitments on the continent - a thousand soldiers are coming home every week - we must keep a powerful force deployed there. the united states must remain a european power in the broadest sense, able to influence the policies and events that affect the livelihood and security of future generations of americans. the violence in what used to be yugoslavia is an affront to humanity. we condemn those responsible for the carnage there and call for an immediate international investigation of atrocities. we support the united nations peacekeeping effort and urge an immediate cease-fire by all parties. the united states should continue to demand respect for international law and fundamental human rights in this agonizing conflict. we encourage a peaceful settlement for cyprus and respect by all parties for the wishes of the cypriot people. we urge peace and justice for northern ireland. we welcome the newly begun process of constitutional dialogue that holds so much promise. we encourage investment and reconstruction to create opportunity for all. in the middle east, prospects for peace have been transformed by the determined statesmanship of george bush. without the leadership of president bush, iraq would today threaten world peace, the peace and security of the middle east, and the very survival of israel with a huge conventional army and nuclear weapons. direct peace talks, on terms israel rightly had sought for more than four decades, would not be a reality. soviet jewish emigration likely would have been interrupted. the rescue of ethiopian jewry might not have happened. and the equation of zionism to racism still would be a grotesque stain on the united nations. although much has changed for the better, the middle east remains an area of high tensions - many unrelated to the arabisraeli conflict - where regional conflicts can escalate to threaten the vital interests of the united states. as saddam hussein's aggression against kuwait demonstrated, heavily armed radical regimes are capable of independent aggressive action. in this environment, israel's demonstrated strategic importance to the united states, as our most reliable and capable ally in this part of the world, is more important than ever. this strategic relationship, with its unique moral dimension, explains the understandable support israel receives from millions of americans who participate in our political process. the strong ties between the united states and israel were demonstrated during the gulf war when israel chose not to retaliate against repeated missile attacks, even though they caused severe damage and loss of life. we will continue to broaden and deepen the strategic relationship with our ally israel - the only true democracy in the middle east - by taking additional concrete steps to further institutionalize the partnership. this will include maintaining adequate levels of security and economic assistance; continuing our meetings on military, political and economic cooperation and coordination; pre-positioning military equipment; developing joint contingency plans; and increasing joint naval and air exercises. consistent with our strategic relationship, the united states should continue to provide large-scale security assistance to israel, maintaining israel's qualitative military advantage over any adversary or coalition of adversaries. we also will continue to negotiate with the major arms supplying nations to reach an agreement on limiting arms sales to the middle east and preventing the proliferation of non-conventional weapons. we applaud the president's leadership in fostering unprecedented direct talks between israel and its arab neighbors. the united states is prepared to use its good offices to mediate disputes at their request. we do not believe the united states should attempt to impose a solution on the parties. the basis for negotiations must be u.n. security council resolutions and . peace must come from direct negotiations. it will be up to the negotiators to determine exactly what is required to satisfy these resolutions, but we firmly believe israel has a right to exist in secure and recognized borders. as president bush stated in madrid, our objective is not simply to end the state of war; rather, it is to establish real peace, one with treaties, security, diplomatic relations, trade, investment, cultural exchange, even tourism. we want the middle east to become a place where people lead normal lives. a meaningful peace must assure israel's security while recognizing the legitimate rights of the palestinian people. we oppose the creation of an independent palestinian state. nor will we support the creation of any political entity that would jeopardize israel's security. as israelis and palestinians negotiate interim selfgovernment, no party will be required to commit itself to any specific final outcome of direct negotiations. israel should not be forced to negotiate with any party. in this regard, the united states will have no dialogue with the plo until it satisfies in full the conditions laid out by president bush in . we believe jerusalem should remain an undivided city, with free and unimpeded access to all holy places by people of all faiths. no genuine peace would deny jews the right to live anywhere in the special city of jerusalem. peace in the middle east entails cooperation among all the parties in the region. to this end, we have worked to bring all of the states of the area together with israel to hold multilateral negotiations on issues of common concern such as regional development, water, refugees, arms control and the environment. we support these forums as a means of encouraging arab acceptance of israel and solving common regional problems. we continue to back legislation mandating that if the united nations and its agencies were to deny israel's right to participate, the united states would withhold financial support and withdraw from those bodies until their action was rectified. republicans believe freedom of emigration is a fundamental human right and that jews from any nation should be free to travel to israel. republicans are proud that we have maintained our historic and moral commitment to the resettlement in israel of persecuted jews. we congratulate president bush and secretary (of state james a.) baker (iii) on the agreement with israel for a generous package of loan guarantees that will provide new immigrants with needed humanitarian assistance. we also should maintain our close ties with and generous aid for egypt, which properly reaps the benefits of its courageous peace with israel. we continue to support egypt and other prowestern states in the region against subversion and aggression and call for an end to the arab boycott of israel. we also support establishment of a strong central government in lebanon, democratically elected and representative of its citizens. we salute all the countries in the middle east who contributed to the success of desert storm and share our goal of stability in the region. with them, we hope to build upon that triumph a new future for the middle east, founded on mutual respect and a common longing for peace. to promote this goal, we should settle for nothing less than full, unconditional, immediate and verified iraqi compliance with all aspects of the cease-fire laid out in u.n. resolutions. in the western hemisphere, as elsewhere, we must promote democratic values. we will continue to seek cooperation in the common battle against the drug lords. we will also lower barriers to trade and investment, knowing that our exports to latin america are helping to lead our economic recovery at home. the president's enterprise for the americas initiative and the north american free trade agreement mean, for the united states, billions of dollars in new trade, hundreds of thousands of new jobs, and a long-term solution to the economic pressures behind illegal immigration. we welcome positive changes, economic and political, in mexico and salute the people of panama on their recovery of free institutions after operation just cause. we commend president bush for the decisive military action that led to the end of the corrupt (manuel antonio) noriega regime and freedom for democratically minded panamanians. we will uphold free and unencumbered u.s. access to the canal. we hail the patriots of el salvador and nicaragua, whose bravery and blood thwarted communism and castro despite the inconstancy of congressional democrats. together with other members of the organization of american states, we will work to restore democracy to haiti. the monroe doctrine remains a cardinal principle of our foreign policy, and we continue to strive toward the day when the alien ideology of communism and fidel castro's regime will be purged from cuba, and americans can welcome cuban people back into the family of free nations. toward that end, we support radio and tv marti and the spirit of cuba libre. in asia, we remain committed to the spread of political and economic liberty. we will work with japan for common progress and maintain military presence in japan and in asia. we also will promote greater japanese responsibility for self-defense and worldwide prosperity. we reaffirm our commitment to the security of taiwan and regard any attempt to alter its status by force as a threat to the entire region. we adhere to the taiwan relations act, the basis for continuing cooperation with those who have stood loyally with us for half a century. our policy toward china is based on support for democratic reform. we need to maintain the relationship with china so that we can effectively encourage such reform. we will continue to work toward the day when the chinese people will finally complete their journey to an open society, free of the deplorable restrictions on personal liberties that still exist. we will maintain our close relationship with the republic of korea, helping to deter aggression from the north. north korea remains an outlaw state and must not be permitted to acquire nuclear weapons. with the people of the philippines, we will maintain our special ties of history and affection. we support the movement in cambodia toward peace and democracy. we demand the fullest possible accounting for america's pows and mias in southeast asia. the grief of their families touches all of us. we will seek complete information in all forums and from all sources. our president has put the government of vietnam on notice: improved relations depends upon this goal. in africa, despite opposition from congressional democrats, we armed freedom fighters and helped force the withdrawal of cuban troops. now we enter the long season of building, trying to revive faith in democracy on a continent ravaged by marxist wars, looted by local dictators and misled by socialist ideology. political and economic liberty are the keys. we will support responsible efforts by the international community to help end the anarchy in somalia and to address the plight of the people of that country suffering from drought and starvation. we condemn those who are using armed force to impede food distribution. in south africa, the republican policy of constructive engagement - opposing apartheid while fostering peaceful change - has been successful. that nation's prospects have been transformed for the better, though many difficulties lie ahead. we condemn all violence against the innocent and applaud those who seek reconciliation to create a new, democratic south africa. we encourage economic reform as crucial to both security and prosperity in the new south africa. we recognize that foreign aid must have a reasonable relationship to our national interests. we therefore support an ongoing review of such programs so that they can be both effectual and justified. we promote financial contribution from other democracies of the world to share the cost of the american burden for peacekeeping and foreign aid. we support efforts by private voluntary agencies to help meet the needs of countries newly liberated from communism and of the developing world in such areas as medical, agricultural, educational and entrepreneurial assistance. opening the world to american business. the triumph of democracy is also a victory for economic freedom. all the world over, people in search of a better life are rejecting politicians' control of their future. this will mean a broader horizon for american opportunity. the whole world has become our marketplace. the election of will determine whether our country seizes this tremendous opportunity or retreats from it. republicans trust individuals and families to make their own economic decisions; democrat politicians do not. we reject their program of strangled trade, industrial policy, high taxes and regulation. we reject punitive taxes on foreign businesses in this country that only invite retaliatory taxes against u.s. businesses abroad. trade war is the road to international depression - and for keeping american workers dependent on government handouts. we do not want to replace the arms race with a subsidies race. putting americans first means keeping the national interest ahead of the special interests. it means opening the world to american goods within a system of free and expanding trade. just as ronald reagan declared in berlin, ""tear down this wall,"" so george bush is dismantling the walls of protectionism in order to continue expanding our exports. our strong commitment to free trade also encompasses vigorous enforcement of u.s. trade laws. we expect a fair and level playing field in our trade with other nations and will work to ensure that foreign markets are just as open to our goods as u.s. markets are to theirs. in all negotiations concerning trade, we will put the interests of america first. throughout the world, as here at home, the republican party stands for growth. america's families have nothing to fear - and everything to gain - from the new era of free enterprise and prosperity that will emerge as free people compete, excel and progress. banishing the nuclear nightmare. the world has moved from the brink of disaster to the threshold of historic opportunity. for almost half a century, we lived under the shadow of nuclear destruction. today, that specter is fading. we will not stop here. we will banish the threat of nuclear annihilation from the face of the earth - not by savaging our military, as some democrats might insist but by building on the historic diplomatic achievements of presidents bush and reagan. this means ensuring stable command and control of the former soviet arsenal, complete acceptance and verified implementation of all treaty obligations by the successor states to the soviet union, and achieving the additional percent reduction in strategic forces now agreed upon. we must assist in dismantling weapons, transforming the massive soviet war machine into an engine of peace and civilian revival. we will cooperate with our former adversaries both to curtail proliferation and to move beyond the abm treaty toward effective ballistic missile defenses. we will not permit the soviet nuclear nightmare to be replaced by another one. outlaw nations - north korea, iran, iraq, libya and others - lust for weapons of mass destruction. this is the nightmare of proliferation: nuclear, chemical and biological weapons that, together with ballistic missiles, can deliver death across whole continents, including our own. we will renew and strengthen the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. we will design security policies to counter proliferation dangers. we will reinforce multilateral accords like the missile technology control regime. and most important, we will develop and deploy global defenses against ballistic missiles. despite the opposition of the democratic party and congressional democrats, we will deploy an effective strategic defense system for the american people. america's security because america won the cold war, our homes and neighborhoods are more secure then they have been for half a century. our children are safer. the greatest peace dividend is peace itself. for it, we thank god. victory was never inevitable. it was won in blood and treasure, over five decades, by the american people - from the military on the front lines to the taxpayers sustaining the forces of freedom. it was also secured, and the course of mankind profoundly changed for the better, because two successive republican presidents, ronald reagan and george bush, were dedicated to peace through strength. ""peace through strength"" was more than a slogan. it was the calculated republican plan for, first, the survival, and then the triumph, of america. but freedom did not come cheaply, and the new world we celebrate today required great sacrifice. in we inherited from jimmy carter and anti-defense democrats a crippled military: demoralized, underfunded, illequipped. republicans told the truth to the american people; they heeded our call to arms. we restored our armed forces to their proper place in both the budget and the pride of the nation. our men and women in uniform today are the equals of the finest soldiers, sailors and airmen who ever wore the uniform of our country. like earlier generations in and , they won a great victory. now, as in the aftermath of those earlier conflicts, comes the difficult task of reducing both the size and cost of defense without letting down america's guard. in the past, terrible mistakes were made, and we paid dearly for them when war came to korea. we will not allow that to happen again. america challenged. the greatest danger to america's security is here at home, among those who would leave the nation unprepared for the new realities of the post cold war world. the ruthless demagogues in rogue regimes are real and so are the nuclear, chemical and biological weapons they seek. the danger of nuclear proliferation is real, especially with the dispersal of nuclear know-how after the collapse of the soviet union. that is why the republican party, whose leaders, such as dan quayle, insisted upon fielding a new patriot missile in the 1980s, now calls for a new generation of defense against the scuds of tomorrow. rather than admit their mistakes of the past, the same liberal democrats who sought to disarm america against the soviet threat now compound their errors with a new campaign half audacity, half mendacity - to leave the nation unprotected in a still dangerous world. republicans call for a controlled defense drawdown, not a free fall. that is why president bush proposes to carefully reduce defense spending over the next four years by an additional $ billion, including $ billion in outlays, with a percent reduction in personnel. he has already eliminated over weapon systems. around the world, american forces are coming home from the frontiers of the cold war. more than overseas bases are being closed or realigned. yet u.s. forces retain the ability to meet the challenge of another desert storm with equal success. u.s. defense spending already has been reduced significantly. five years ago, it was more than a quarter of the federal budget. by it will be less than a sixth. spending on defense and intelligence, as a proportion of gross domestic product, will be the lowest it has been since before world war ii. yet any defense budget, however lean, is still too much for the democrats. they want to start by cutting defense outlays over the next four years by nearly $ billion beyond the president's cuts, throwing as many as million additional americans out of work. and this may be just the beginning, as the democrats use the defense budget as a bottomless piggy bank to try to beat swords into pork barrels. this is folly. it would take us back to the hollow military of the carter era. once american defenses are allowed to decay, they cannot be rebuilt overnight. effective arsenals, like effective leaders, require years of patient development. and our greatest asset of all, the people on whom our security depends, deserve a constant long-term investment in their quality, morale and safety. republicans pledge to provide it. america secure. because the united states will rely on a smaller force of offensive nuclear weapons to deter aggression in the post-cold war era, we will maintain the triad of land, sea, and air-based strategic forces. we will continue to test the safety, reliability and effectiveness of our nuclear weapons. with a smaller military, modernization of conventional forces is more important than ever. desert storm showed the importance of ""force multipliers"" like smart munitions, stealth technology and night-fighting capabilities. we will upgrade existing weapons and selectively procure those that hold the promise of dramatic forward leaps in capability. under no circumstances will we yield our technological superiority. we must remain ready to defend american citizens and interests wherever they may be threatened. essential to that readiness is maintenance of a strong global navy and modernization of vital airlift and sealift capacity. we remain committed to combating terrorism in all its forms wherever it threatens u.s. citizens or interests. republicans will preserve the nation's access to space for defense, as well as for other purposes, and ensure that space technology does not fall into dangerous hands. transformed by the collapse of communism, our strategic defense initiative (sdi) is now designed to provide the united states and our allies with global defenses against limited ballistic missile attacks. sdi is the greatest investment in peace we could ever make. this system will be our shield against technoterrorism. russia has agreed to be our partner in it, sharing early warning information and jointly moving forward to stop those who would rain death upon the innocent. we will use missile defenses to assure threatened nations that they do not need to acquire ballistic missiles of their own. we will move beyond the abm treaty to deploy effective defenses with the goal of someday eliminating, not merely reducing, the threat of nuclear holocaust. we support efforts to reduce armaments, both conventional and otherwise, but the most effective arms control of all over the long run is democracy. free nations do not attack one another. that is why the promotion of democracy on every continent is an essential part of the republican defense agenda. managing the peace. a new era in defense requires new approaches to management, to get more out of every dollar in a shrinking budget. that calls for dramatically different ways of doing business. for example, president bush's reforms in defense management and acquisition already mean massive savings - $ billion through - without sacrificing combat capability. our armed forces will still depend on our superb industrial base for everything from belt buckles to submarines. we cannot lose that engineering and manufacturing capability. this is especially true of the high technology, demonstrated in desert storm, that made our enemies realize they had been left behind in the race for the future. we therefore pledge to maintain america's technological lead, preserve its defense industrial base, and maintain robust levels of investment in research and development. we will attack the problem of waste in the military, especially at its root in the pork barrel politics of capitol hill. a republican congress will end the costly micromanagement of defense programs and reduce the number and scope of oversight committees. we will urge the department of defense to encourage a broader constituency for saving and to continue genuine procurement reforms based on performance rather than unreasonable regulations imposed by the democrat congress. we will continue the successful effort to eliminate redundancy and streamline all facets of defense management. we applaud the president's efforts to assist all individuals and communities adversely affected by the ongoing defense builddown, with more than defense adjustment programs already in place and more than $ billion committed to the effort in just the next two years. the men and women of defense. republicans created the allvolunteer army, and we hail its success. we pledge to keep faith with the men and women volunteers and with their families, for they are the backbone of the nation's defense. we oppose democrat efforts to bring back the draft, whether directly or through the subterfuge of compulsory domestic service. the armed forces are a colorblind meritocracy, a model for the rest of our society. its enlistees should receive preference in federal education and retraining programs. we applaud the advancement of women in the military and single out for special recognition the outstanding contribution of women in operations desert shield/desert storm. however, we oppose liberal democrat attempts to place women in combat positions just to make an ideological point. unlike the democratic party and its candidate, we support the continued exclusion of homosexuals from the military as a matter of good order and discipline. the department of defense will not be an exception to our assertion of family values. republicans will not tolerate sexual harassment or misconduct toward any individual in the ranks. we demand both its prevention and its punishment. to drive home that point, we urge a halt to the sale, in military facilities, of sexually explicit materials. we call for greater consideration of the needs of families when parents are called to duty. we must ensure that all of the various benefits, including medical, that were promised to the men and women who chose to make the military and the defense of their nation a career are fulfilled even upon retirement. in the republican tradition of support for america's veterans, we proposed and created a department of veterans affairs so their concerns would be represented at the cabinet table. we affirm our support for veterans preference in federal employment and for sufficient funding to maintain the integrity of the veterans hospital and medical-care system. we strongly endorse programs to meet the needs of unemployed veterans. intelligence. desert storm reminded us that our intelligence community is a national asset of critical importance to our security. assuring the availability of timely and reliable information on regional threats and unrest, drug trafficking, terrorism, technology transfer, proliferation and a host of other issues this is one of our highest national priorities in the post-cold war world. u.s. policy-makers also must have the best possible understanding of international trade, investment, industrial, financial and other developments that affect our economic security. we must and will maintain the full range of our traditional intelligence capabilities, including covert action, to ensure our security in a dangerous and unpredictable world. we reject the democrat candidate's proposal to cripple u.s. intelligence and decry the deep spending cuts to the intelligence budget sponsored by democrats in congress. proven leadership. george bush has been the most important architect of western aspirations and designs for the challenging world we are now entering. his record is clear. president bush has shown he understands how to lead in this new era, where the pre-eminent position of the united states offers new opportunities to build an international consensus on key issues. president bush, with experienced republican leadership, has proved he knows how to place our nation at the center of effective coalitions where our power is multiplied. the test of international leadership is on the field, not in a playbook. the oval office is no place for on-the-job training - not in carrying out the presidential duty to protect and defend our nation, not in managing the arsenal of the supreme nuclear power. there are those who talk and those who perform. george bush has clearly performed for america, making the right calls in a series of tough decisions that helped transform the world. now that we have won the cold war, we must secure the peace that follows. history has shown that the years following conflict are often critical - where the choices made can either lay the foundation for lasting peace or sow the seeds of the future war. in this period of high hopes and great challenges ahead, the nation needs the tested and experienced leadership of president bush and the republican party.","['preamble', 'abraham', 'lincoln', 'first', 'republican', 'president',

Republican Party,1996,1990,rep_1996.csv,CSV,"PREAMBLE We meet to nominate a candidate and pass a platform at a moment of measureless national opportunity. A new century beckons, and Americans are more than equal to its challenges. But there is a problem. The Clinton administration has proven unequal to the heritage of our past, the promise of our times, and the character of the American people. They require more and demand better. With them, we raise our voices and raise our sights. We are the heirs of world leadership that was earned by bravery and sacrifice on half a thousand battlefields. We will soon nominate for the presidency a man who knew battle and so loves peace, a man who lives bravely and so walks humbly with his God and his fellow citizens. We walk with him now as he joins one more battle, every bit as crucial for our country's future as was the crusade in which he served. Just when America should be leading the world, we have an administration squandering the international respect it did not earn and does not value. Just when America should be demonstrating anew the dynamic power of economic freedom, we have an administration working against both history and public opinion to expand the reach and burden of government. Just when Americans are reasserting their deepest values, we have an administration locked into the counterculture battles of its youth. Americans are right to say we are on the wrong track. Our prestige in the world is declining. Economic growth here at home is anemic. Our society grows more violent and less decent. The only way the Clinton administration can magnify its questionable accomplishments is to lower our expectations. Those who lead the Democrat party call America to smaller tasks and downsized dreams. That is not the calling of an American president. Today's Democrat leaders do not understand leadership. They reduce principles to tactics. They talk endlessly and confront nothing. They offer, not convictions, but alibis. They are paralyzed by indecision, weakened by scandal and guided only by the perpetuation of their own power. We asked for change. We worked for reform. We offered cooperation and consensus. Now, the asking is over. The Clinton administration cannot be reinvented, it must be replaced. Republicans do not duplicate or fabricate or counterfeit a vision for the land we love. With our fellow citizens, we assert the present power of timeless truths. This is what we want for America: real prosperity that reaches beyond the stock market to every family, small business and worker. An economy expanding as fast as American enterprise and creativity will carry it, free from unnecessary taxes, regulation and litigation. This is what we want for America: the restoration of self-government by breaking Washington's monopoly on power. The American people want their country back. We will help them to regain it. This too we want for America: moral clarity in our culture and ethical leadership in the White House. We offer America, not a harsh moralism, but our sincere conviction that the values we hold in our hearts determine the success of our lives and the shape of our society. It matters greatly that our leaders reflect and communicate those values, not undermine or mock them. The diversity of our nation is reflected in this platform. We ask for the support and participation of all who substantially share our agenda. In one way or another, every Republican is a dissenter. At the same time, we are not morally indifferent. In this, as in many things, Lincoln is our model. At a time of great crisis, he spoke both words of healing and words of conviction. We do likewise, not for the peace of a political party, but because we citizens are bound together in a great enterprise for our children's future. The platform that follows marshals these principles and sends them into action. We aim at nothing less than an economy of dynamic growth; a renewal of community, self-government and citizenship; and a national reaffirmation of the enduring principles on which America's greatness depends. We will count our victories, not in elections won or in economic numbers on a chart, but in the everyday achievements of the American dream: when a man or woman discovers the dignity and confidence of a job; when a child rejects drugs and embraces life; when an entrepreneur turns an idea into an industry; when a family once again feels the security of its savings and has control over the education of its children. None of the extraordinary things about our country are gifts of government. They are the accomplishments of free people in a free society. They are achievements, not entitlements - and are sweeter for that fact. They result when men and women live in obedience to their conscience, not to the state. All our efforts as Republicans are guided by the fixed star of this single principle: that freedom always exceeds our highest expectations. This is the greatest task before the Republican Party: to raise the bar of American expectations. Of the potential of our economy. Of the order and civility of our culture. Of what a president can be, and what the presidency must be again. There is a continuing revolution in the yellowed parchment and faded ink of the American creed...a revolution that will long outlive us. It can carry the weight of all our hopes. It can reward every dreamer. It is the reason that America's finest hour is never a memory and always a goal. With trust in God and in fidelity to generations past and generations to come, we respectfully submit this platform to the American people. PRINCIPLES OF THE 1996 REPUBLICAN PLATFORM Introduction Because Americans are a diverse and tolerant people, they have differences of opinion on many issues. But as a people, we share a common dream and common goals: A strong America that protects its citizens and champions their democratic ideals throughout the world, An America with a vibrant and growing economy that improves the standard of living for all, An America with a smaller, more effective and less intrusive government that trusts its people to decide what is best for them, An America whose people feel safe and secure in their homes, on their streets, and in their communities, An America where our children receive the best education in the world and learn the values like decency and responsibility that made this country great, And an America with the compassion to care for those who cannot care for themselves. Principles 1. Because the American Dream fulfills the promise of liberty, we believe it should be attainable by all through more and secure jobs, home ownership, personal security, and education that meets the challenges of the century ahead. 2. Because a dynamic and growing economy is the best way to create more and better paying jobs, with greater security in the work place, we believe in lower taxes within a simpler tax system, in tandem with fair and open trade and a balanced federal budget. 3. Because wasteful government spending and over-regulation, fueled by higher taxes, are the greatest obstacles to job creation and economic growth, we believe in a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution and a common-sense approach to government rules and red tape. 4. Because we recognize our obligation to foster hope and opportunity for those unable to care for themselves, we believe in welfare reform that eliminates waste, fraud and abuse; requires work from those who are capable; limits time on public assistance; discourages illegitimacy; and reduces the burden on the taxpayers. 5. Because all Americans have the right to be safe in their homes, on their streets, and in their communities, we believe in tough law enforcement, especially against juvenile crime and the drug traffic, with stiff penalties, no loopholes, and judges who respect the rights of law-abiding Americans. 6. Because institutions like the family are the backbone of a healthy society, we believe government must support the rights of the family; and recognizing within our own ranks different approaches toward our common goal, we reaffirm respect for the sanctity of human life. 7. Because our children need and are entitled to the best education in the world, we believe in parental involvement and family choice in schooling, teacher authority and accountability, more control to local school boards, and emphasis upon the basics of learning in safe classrooms. 8. Because older Americans have built our past and direct us, in wisdom and experience, toward the future, we believe we must meet our nation's commitments to them by preserving and protecting Medicare and Social Security. 9. Because a good society rests on an ethical foundation, we believe families, communities, and religious institutions can best teach the American values of honesty, responsibility, hard work, compassion, and mutual respect. 10. Because our country's greatest strength is its people, not its government, we believe today's government is too large and intrusive and does too many things the people could do better for themselves. 11. Because we trust our fellow Americans, rather than centralized government, we believe the people, acting through their State and local elected officials, should have control over programs like education and welfare - thereby pushing power away from official Washington and returning it to the people in their communities and states. 12. Because we view the careful development of our country's natural resources as stewardship of creation, we believe property rights must be honored in our efforts to restore, protect, and enhance the environment for the generations to come. 13. Because we are all one America, we oppose discrimination. We believe in the equality of all people before the law and that individuals should be judged by their ability rather than their race, creed, or disability. 14. Because this is a difficult and dangerous world, we believe that peace can be assured only through strength, that a strong national defense is necessary to protect America at home and secure its interests abroad, and that we must restore leadership and character to the presidency as the best way to restore America's leadership and credibility throughout the world. BUILDING A BETTER AMERICA ""This is no time for diminished expectations. This is no time to sell America's potential short. This is a time to let go of the 20th Century and embrace the 21st - to seize the promise of the new era by liberating the genius of the American people."" Bob Dole, September 5, 1995 in Chicago, Illinois Improving the Standard of Living We are the party of America's earners, savers, and taxpayers - the people who work hard, take risks and build a better future for our families and our communities. Our party believes that we can best improve the standard of living in America by empowering the American people to act in their own behalf by: -- cutting the near-record tax burden on Americans; -- reducing government spending and its size, while balancing the budget. -- creating jobs; -- using the benefits of science, technology and innovations to improve both our lives and our competitiveness in the global economy; -- dramatically increasing the number of families who can own their own home; and -- unleashing the competitiveness and will to win of individual Americans on the world trade scene with free but fair trade. That's not wishful thinking; it's what we, the American people, used to take for granted before the growth of big government began to shadow our days and smother our hopes. In the 1980s - when we cut taxes, restrained regulation, and reduced government spending as a share of the nation's economy - prosperity made a comeback. Jobs were created, incomes rose and poverty fell for seven straight years. Then the Democrat-controlled Congress forced the tax hikes of 1990 and jammed through Bill Clinton's tax bill of 1993. Since then, Clintonomics has produced an economy that is squeezing the middle class between high taxes and low growth. The astounding fact is that we were growing 50% faster in 1992, when Bill Clinton described the economy as the worst in five decades. We've managed to avoid a recession only because the Republican Congress put the brakes on Bill Clinton's rush to ruin by substantially reducing government spending over the last two years. But we cannot go on like this. For millions of families, the American Dream is fading. Our goal is to revive it, renew it, and extend it to all who reach for it. Our formula for growth, opportunity, and a better family life is simple: Trust the people, cut their taxes, scale back the size and scope of government, foster job creation, and get out of the way. We've done it before, we can do it again. Tax Relief for Economic Growth American families are suffering from the twin burdens of stagnant incomes and near-record taxes. This is the key cause of middle-class anxiety. It is why people feel they are working harder, but falling further behind; why they fear the current generation will not be as successful as the last generation; why they believe their children will be worse off; and why they feel so anxious about their own economic future. After averaging 1.7 percent growth annually during the expansion following the 1981 tax cut, family incomes have failed to grow at all under Bill Clinton. Since 1990, families have actually lost much of the ground they gained during the low-tax, high-growth 1980s. Anemic economic growth under Bill Clinton is largely responsible for this lost ground. The current economic expansion has not only failed to compare to the growth seen in the decade preceding his administration, it is the slowest recovery in the last 100 years. Since 1992, the economy has grown by only 2.4 percent per year, compared to 3.2 percent in the previous 10 years and 3.9 percent between 1983 and 1989. Bill Clinton has demonstrated that he fails to understand the role excessive tax burdens play on the economy and family incomes. In the first year of his administration, he pushed through the largest tax increase in history, raising taxes on families, senior citizens, and small businesses. Confronted with Republican attempts to cut family and business taxes, he vetoed the 1995 Balanced Budget Act which included the $500 per child tax credit as well as incentives to increase savings, economic growth and job creation. The Clinton tax increase has produced the second-highest tax burden in American history. Federal tax collections now consume more than one-fifth of our total economic output. Federal, state, and local taxes take more than 38 cents out of every dollar the American family earns. The federal tax burden alone is now approaching a record 25 percent of family income. American families deserve better. They should be allowed to keep more of their hard-earned money so they can spend on their priorities, as opposed to sending ever-increasing amounts to Washington to be spent on the priorities of federal bureaucrats. In response to this unprecedented burden confronting America, we support an across-the-board, 15-percent tax cut to marginal tax rates. Fifteen percent represents the total increase in the federal tax burden since Bill Clinton took office, and we believe such a cut should be the first step towards reducing overall tax burdens while promoting the economic growth that will raise family incomes and our overall standard of living. Another drag on family finances has been government's failure to maintain the personal and dependent exemption at historic levels. If the personal and dependent exemption that was $600 in 1950 had kept pace with inflation, it would be $3,800 rather than the current $2,500. That is why Republicans have made the $500-per-child family tax credit one of the primary features of our tax cut package. Job creation and increasing family incomes depend on economic growth, and a precondition for economic growth is a healthy rate of saving and investment. Nevertheless, Bill Clinton vetoed Republican bills to provide these incentives, including expanded and more generous IRAs - and new spousal IRAs - which could be used for health care, education, and home-buying. As a result, today's personal savings rate is less than half what it was two decades ago. Republicans support expansion of IRAs and the establishment of spousal IRAs to encourage savings and investment. Bill Clinton also vetoed provisions to reduce the capital gains tax rate. Excessive taxes on investment cripple the American economy and kill American jobs by increasing the cost of capital, locking in resources, and stifling small business growth and entrepreneurial activity. Largely because of these excessive taxes, American businesses face a competitive disadvantage with respect to our major trading partners, hurting their ability to export products abroad and create jobs. To remove impediments to job creation and economic growth, we support reducing the top tax rate on capital gains by 50 percent. In 1993, Bill Clinton raised taxes on millions of middle-class retirees by dramatically increasing the income tax on Social Security benefits. This targeted attack on the economic security of our elderly was unfair and misguided. Republicans believe that this Clinton initiative must be repealed. These proposals making the current tax code fairer and less burdensome should be viewed as an interim step towards comprehensive tax reform. The current tax code is ridiculously complex and unfair. It is also an unnecessary drag on the economy. At a time when business investment plans are greatly diminished and savings rates are unacceptably low, we must reform our tax system to remove existing artificial, government-induced bias against saving and investment. To that end, we firmly commit to a tax code for the 21st century that will raise revenue sufficient for a smaller, more effective and less wasteful government without increasing the national debt. That new tax system must be flatter, fairer, and simpler, with a minimum of exclusions from its coverage, and one set of rules applying to all. It must be simple enough to be understood by all and enforced by few, with a low-cost of compliance which replaces the current stack of endless forms with a calculation which can be performed on the back of a postcard. It must expand the economy and increase opportunity by rewarding initiative and hard work. It must foster job creation and end bias against saving. It must promote personal freedom and innovation. It must do all this in order to boost wages and raise living standards for all of America's working families. A simple, fair tax system that is pro-growth and pro-family will not need today's burdensome IRS. That agency has become a nightmare for law-abiding taxpayers. It must be dramatically downsized - with resources going to more important efforts like drug enforcement - and made less intrusive. To protect the American people from those who would undo their forthcoming victory over big government, we support legislation requiring a super-majority vote in both houses of Congress to raise taxes. We also support a government that keeps its word. Retroactive taxation, like Bill Clinton's infamous 1993 tax hike, breaks that word. We pledge a legislative or constitutional remedy to prohibit its repetition. Because of their vital role in fostering charity and patriotism, we oppose taxing religious and fraternal benefit societies. We will not tolerate attempts to impose taxes by federal judges. Balancing the Budget and Reducing Spending ""We didn't dig ourselves into a $5 trillion debt because the American people are undertaxed. We got that $5 trillion debt because government overspends."" ""The budget deficit is a 'stealth tax' that pushes up interest rates and costs the typical family $36,000 on an average home mortgage, $1,400 on an ordinary student loan, and $700 on a car loan."" Bob Dole Raising tax rates is the wrong way to balance the budget. It enables the Clinton tax addicts to wastefully spend the public's money. Republicans support a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution, phased in over a short period and with appropriate safeguards for national emergencies. We passed it in the House of Representatives, but Bill Clinton and his allies - especially the Senate's somersault six, who switched their long-standing position on the issue - blocked it by a single vote. As president, Bob Dole will lead the fight for that amendment, and in the States, Republicans will finish the fight for its speedy ratification. Once and for all, we declare: -- the budget deficit and high taxes are two halves of the vise that is producing the Clinton middle class squeeze; -- a balanced budget and lower taxes go hand in hand, not in separate directions; -- reducing the budget deficit by shrinking government produces a fiscal dividend in stronger growth and lower interest rates; -- ending that deficit will make possible a dramatic return of resources to the American people; -- tax relief is the only way to return the economy to the growth rates our country enjoyed from World War II to the coming of Bill Clinton; and -- we will not mortgage our children's future by incurring deficits. A president should be Commander-in-Chief in the nation's budget battle as well as in military conflicts. Bill Clinton has been AWOL - Absent Without Leadership. Congressional Republicans had to fight his Senate allies for over a year just to give him a line-item veto for appropriation bills. Instead of helping us strengthen the presidency in this way, he set an historic precedent: vetoing whole appropriation bills because they spent too little money! His vetoes essentially shut down much of the government. We make this promise: A Republican president will veto money bills that spend too much, not too little, and will use the line-item veto to lead the charge against wasteful spending. A Republican president will build on the achievements of our Republican Congress which has cut spending in excess of $53 billion over the last two years. The Clinton Administration's tactic of using irresponsible monetary policy to hide the effects of their bad fiscal policies leads to: -- higher inflation; -- lower growth; -- fewer jobs; and -- scarcity of capital to fund small businesses. This is not only bad economics; it is a hidden tax against both income and savings. We pledge a non-political monetary policy to keep prices stable and maintain public confidence in the value of the dollar. Creating Jobs for Americans Our goal is to empower the American people by expanding employment and entrepreneurial opportunities. Fundamentally, jobs are created in the private sector. Small businesses are the engines of growth and job creation. They generate 75 percent of new jobs and 55 percent of our gross domestic product. The Republican Party is committed to the survival, the revival, and the resurgence of small business. In addition to our overall program of lower taxes, regulatory reform, and less spending, we will: -- allow small businesses to deduct the costs of their health insurance; -- restore the fair home-office deduction so important to start-up businesses; -- assure that no one who inherits a small business or farm has to sell it to pay inheritance taxes; -- make the IRS stop its discrimination against independent contractors; -- enact both legal reform and product liability legislation to shield small businesses and protect jobs from the threat of unfair litigation; and -- transfer from the public sector services that can be provided by the private sector more efficiently and cost effectively. Small business is a force for enormous progress, socially, politically, and economically. This is both an economic and a civil rights agenda. Small businesses owned by women now employ more people than all the Fortune 500 companies combined. Republican-created enterprise zones will offer dramatic opportunities to workers employed by small businesses, particularly minorities and the ""Forgotten Workers."" Republicans support the creation of jobs in all areas of the country, from the inner city to rural America. We must create the workplace of the future so that it becomes a vehicle for personal liberation for those who seek a foothold on the opportunity ladder. We advocate increased access to capital for businesses to expand, export, and bring new products and technologies to market. We propose to consolidate federal training programs and to transfer their administration to the States and local governments. Restraining the size and spending of government is only part of the job. We must transform official policies and attitudes toward productive Americans. Many of our labor laws and job training programs are out of date and out of touch with the needs of today's workers. Both the Davis Bacon Act and the Service Contract Act, for example, have come to restrict opportunity, increase costs, and inhibit innovation. Congressional Republicans have already launched a fight against the union bosses' ban on flex time and comp-time in private industry. Those innovations are especially important to families with children. Government has no business forbidding America's workers to arrange their schedules to suit the needs of their own families. In the same spirit, we will enact the TEAM Act to empower employers and employees to act as a team, rather than as adversaries, to advance their common interests. (It is opposed only by those who profit from labor conflict, for whom Bill Clinton has vetoed the bill.) Another way to replace conflict with concerted action is to transform OSHA from an adversarial agency into a pioneering advocate of safer productivity. We will mesh its activities with the work of councils formed under the TEAM Act to advance worker protection from the ground up. In contrast, the Clinton Administration has produced no regulatory reform, no tax relief, no product liability reform, and no legal reform. Our vision is that everyone who seeks a job will have a job. We will break the ""job lock"" and bring employment opportunities to all Americans. Science, Technology, and Innovation in the 21st Century Our goal is to empower the American people by using the benefits of advanced science to improve their quality of life without undue restraint from government. Our bottom line is more jobs, better jobs, and a higher standard of living for the families of America. As we prepare for the dawn of a new century, it is essential that our public policies keep pace with an evolving economy. Increased productivity is essential to expand the economy and improve the standard of living of all Americans. A recent report by the Office of Technology Assessment attributes at least half of all economic growth in the United States to advances in technology. America is expanding its leadership role as a country that fosters innovation and technological advances, the essential ingredients of increased productivity. Leading these efforts are the men and women - and high technology businesses - that foster creative solutions to world problems. We must create policies that enable these thoughtful leaders to continue to invest in research and development. U.S. research and development (R&D);investment has increased significantly over the past two decades and currently accounts for about 2.6 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. The private sector has been the main engine behind this growth, contributing over 60 percent of the national R&D;investment. Such investment has led to increased employment and high-quality jobs. Businesses that invest heavily in R&D;tend to create more jobs, and to employ high-skilled workers in those new jobs at above average wage levels. Research and development is our commitment to the future. It is our investment in the future. We must design tax and regulatory policies that encourage private sector research and experimentation, while lowering the cost of such investments. We believe the marketplace, not bureaucrats, can determine which technologies and entrepreneurs best meet the needs of the public. American companies must use the most advanced production technologies, telecommunications, and information management systems. Technological advance means economic growth, higher productivity, and more security. We therefore support private sector funding of applied research, especially in emerging technologies, and improved education in science and engineering. American workers must have the knowledge and training to effectively utilize the capabilities of those new systems. Federal science programs must emphasize basic research. The tax code must foster research and development. These policies will increase the pace of technological developments by de emphasizing the role of government and strengthening the role of the private sector. We will advance the innovative ideas and pioneering spirit that make possible the impossible. New discoveries to bolster America's international competitiveness are essential. The fruits of federally funded research led to the creation of the biotechnology industry through the Bayh-Dole Act. This is an example of innovation and risk-taking, creating 2,000 biotechnology companies employing thousands of employees and selling billions of dollars of products to keep us first and foremost in the global marketplace. The communications revolution empowers individuals, enhances health care, opens up opportunity for rural areas, and strengthens families and institutions. A Dole-led Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to promote the full and open competition and freedom of choice in the telecommunications marketplace. In contrast, the Clinton-Gore Administration repeatedly defended big-government regulation. This micromanagement of the Information Age is an impediment to the development of America's information superhighway. We support the broadest access to telecommunications networks and services, based upon marketplace capabilities. The Internet today is the most staggering example of how the Information Age can and will enhance the lives of Americans everywhere. To further this explosion of new found freedoms and opportunities, privacy, through secured communications, has never been more important. Bob Dole and the Republican Party will promote policies that ensure that the U.S. remains the world leader in science, technology, and innovation. Homeownership Homeownership is central to the American Dream. It is a commitment to a safe and stable community. It is not something government gives to the people, but rather something they can attain for themselves in a non-inflationary, growing economy. For most Americans, our home is our primary asset. Mortgage interest should remain deductible from the income tax. We applaud Republican congressional efforts to pursue federal budget policies that will result in lower interest rates. Lower interest rates will open up more housing opportunities for more Americans than any program Washington could devise. Republicans support regulatory reform efforts that make buying a house easy, understandable, and affordable. We affirm our commitment to open housing, without quotas or controls, and we condemn the Clinton Administration's abuse of fair housing laws to harass citizens exercising their First Amendment rights. In addition, we support transforming public housing into private housing, converting low-income families into proud homeowners. Resident management of public housing is a first step toward that goal, which includes eliminating the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD's core functions will be turned over to the States. Its civil rights component will be administered by the appropriate federal agency while enforcement will remain with the Department of Justice. With the housing sector representing such a significant segment of the Nation's economy, housing policy is and should continue to be a priority. We believe in a federal role which supplements, not directs or competes with, States and localities. We believe in federal programs which augment, not displace, private sector capital and resources. The Federal Government should not impose prescriptive solutions on State and local governments. Republicans believe that States and localities should have maximum flexibility to design programs which meet the individual needs of their communities. Washington must abandon the ""one size fits all"" approach and concentrate on adding value to the efforts of States, localities, private and faith based organizations and individuals. Republicans believe we can and will accomplish this without disrupting services to the elderly, disabled and families with children. Promoting Trade and International Prosperity Republicans believe that the United States, as the sole superpower in the world today, has a responsibility to lead - economically, militarily, diplomatically, and morally - so that we have a peaceful and prosperous world. Republicans support free and fair trade. In the American Century ahead, our country will lead in international trade. American workers will be the winners in any fair competition, and American technology will drive a prosperity revolution around the world. Exports already fuel our economy; their continuing expansion is essential for full employment and long-term prosperity. That is possible only within the context of expanding trade, and we can do it better without a Department of Commerce. Our country's merchandise trade deficit exploded to $175 billion in 1995 and will likely set an all time record in 1996, siphoning American wealth into the hands of foreigners. Trade deficits with all our major trading partners were worse in 1995 than in 1992. With China alone, the deficit more than doubled to $35 billion in the last three and a half years. With Japan, Bill Clinton announced a series of hollow agreements that have done little to improve market access. With Russia, he approved a $1 billion Export-Import Bank loan to foster competition with the American aircraft industry. With Canada, he tolerates discrimination against the United States beverage industry and focused on our lumber crisis too late to help closed logging mills. With Mexico, he ignored injury to American agriculture from massive surges in imports. We should vigorously implement the North American Free Trade Agreement, while carefully monitoring its progress, to guarantee that its promised benefits and protections are realized by all American workers and consumers. Republicans are for vigorous enforcement of the trade agreements we already have on the books, unlike the Clinton Administration that uses United States trade policy as a bargaining chip and as a vehicle for pursuing a host of other social agenda items. Republicans will enforce United States trade laws, including our antidumping laws, and will use the Super 301 investigations that give the President authority to challenge foreign barriers to our exports. And we will use the Export Enhancement Program to boost American farm exports. To advance economic freedom, we insist that United States foreign aid, whether bilateral or through the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, promote market reforms, limit regulation, and encourage free trade. Republicans will stop subsidizing socialism in the less developed nations. Republicans will not allow the World Trade Organization to undermine United States sovereignty and will support a World Trade Organization oversight commission. Free market capitalism is the right model for economic development throughout the world. The Soviet model of a state-controlled economy has been discredited, and neither stage of development nor geographic location can justify economic authoritarianism. Human nature and aspirations are the same everywhere, and everywhere the family is the building block of economic and social progress. We therefore will protect the rights of families in international programs and will not fund organizations involved in abortion. The cost of turning our back on the global marketplace is the loss of opportunity and millions of jobs for United States citizens. CHANGING WASHINGTON FROM THE GROUND UP ""On November 8, 1994, the American people sent a message to Washington.... Their message is my mandate: To rein in government and reconnect it to the values of the American people. That means making government a whole lot smaller, a lot less arrogant, and getting it out of matters best left to the states, cities, and families across America."" Bob Dole, March 10, 1995 in Washington, D. C. We are the party of small, responsible and efficient government, joining our neighbors in cities and counties, rather than distant bureaucrats, to build a just society and caring communities. We therefore assert the power of the American people over government, rather than the other way around. Our agenda for change, profound and permanent change in the way government behaves, is based on the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. For more than half a century, that solemn compact has been scorned by liberal Democrats and the judicial activism of the judges they have appointed. We will restore the force of the Tenth Amendment and, in the process, renew the trust and respect which hold together a free society. As its first initiative enacted into law, the new Republican majority on Capitol Hill launched that effort early in 1995 by forbidding the imposition of new unfunded mandates upon State and local taxpayers. From now on, if official Washington promises benefits, official Washington must pay for them. We will apply that same principle to the ill-conceived Motor-Voter Act, the Democrats' costly invitation to ballot fraud. To permanently restore balance in the federal system, States must have the proper tools to act as a counterforce to the Federal Government. Our country's founders attempted to carefully balance power between the two levels. The Tenth Amendment, as well as the ability of State legislatures to initiate constitutional amendments, and other constitutional tools given to States to protect their role in the system have now been either eroded away, given away, or rendered impossible to use. Thus, States lack the tools necessary to do their job as a counterbalance to the national government. We call upon Congress, governors, State legislators and local leaders to adopt structural reforms that will permanently restore balance in our federal system. In this Information Era of uncertainty and rapid change, it is government close to home, controlled by neighborhood and community leaders, that can best respond to the needs and values of all citizens. As a first step in reforming government, we support elimination of the Departments of Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Education, and Energy, and the elimination, defunding or privatization of agencies which are obsolete, redundant, of limited value, or too regional in focus. Examples of agencies we seek to defund or to privatize are the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the Legal Services Corporation. In addition, we support Republican-sponsored legislation that would require the original sponsor of proposed federal legislation to cite specific constitutional authority for the measure. A Citizens' Congress Even with these structural changes, a system of government is only as good as the women and men who serve within it. When the voters of 1994 elected Republican majorities in both the House and Senate for the first time in forty years, Capitol Hill had been an institution steeped in corruption and contemptuous of reform. Congressional Republicans changed things, from the ground up. They: -- applied all laws to Congress, so that those who make the rules will have to live by them; -- slashed congressional spending and cut back the staff on Capitol Hill; -- ordered an unprecedented audit of the House of Representatives, with devastating exposure of the Democrats' four decades of mismanagement; -- streamlined legislative procedures by reducing the number of committees and subcommittees; -- imposed term limits for House committee chairs and Leadership positions - something the Democrats still refuse to do; -- abolished proxy voting in House committees, ending the scandal of absentee Members casting phony votes; -- required any Representative charged indicted of a felony offense to relinquish positions of authority within Congress until cleared of wrongdoing; -- ended the Democrats' secret sessions by opening to the press and the public all committee meetings; -- brought to a vote, in both the House and Senate, a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on Members of Congress. It failed to secure the necessary two-thirds vote in the House, where 80 percent of Republicans voted for it and 80 percent of Democrats voted against it. Every Senate Republican voted to allow a vote on term limits, but the Democrats killed it by a filibuster. It will take expanded Republican majorities in the 105th Congress to send to the States a term limits constitutional amendment; and -- passed historic legislation banning gifts to Members of Congress and their staff. We will continue our fight against gerrymandered congressional districts designed to thwart majority rule. We will eliminate made-in-Washington schemes to rig the election process under the guise of campaign reform. True reform is indeed needed: ending taxpayer subsidies for campaigns, strengthening party structures to guard against rogue operations, requiring full and immediate disclosure of all contributions, and cracking down on the indirect support, or ""soft money,"" by which special interest groups underwrite their favored candidates. Cleaning Up Government In 1992, Bill Clinton promised ""the most ethical Administration in the history of the Republic."" Instead, the Clinton Administration has been rife with scandal. An unprecedented four Independent Counsels have been appointed since the Clinton Inauguration to investigate various allegations of wrongdoing by members of this Administration. The Clinton White House has abused executive power in both the White House Travel Office firings situation and in the FBI files matter. The FBI Director said there have been ""egregious violations of privacy"" in the gathering of FBI files of officials who worked in the White House under Republican administrations. We believe that misuse of law enforcement authorities for partisan political ends is no trivial matter. Such abuses strike at the heart of the relationship between citizen and government and undermine the rule of law and confidence in our leaders. Scandals in government are not limited to possible criminal violations. The public trust is violated when taxpayers money is treated as a slush fund for special interest groups who oppose urgently needed reforms. For example, the Democrats have denied school vouchers for poor children in the nation's capital at the demand of special interest unions. They have blocked urgently needed legal reforms at the command of the trial lawyers, now the biggest source of revenue for the Democrat party. They have rejected reforms to improve the workplace to please union bosses who committed $35 million to aid the Clinton reelection effort. It is time to restore honor and integrity to government. We propose to: -- revoke pension rights of public officials who have been convicted of crimes; -- strengthen citizen privacy laws and reform the FBI to guard against the politicization of law enforcement that we have seen by the Clinton White House; -- refuse to allow special interest groups to block innovative solutions for the poor or to block workplace or legal reforms that would help all working Americans; and -- recruit for public service, at all levels, men and women of integrity and high ethical standards. We will end welfare for lobbyists. Every year, the federal government gives away billions of dollars in grants. Much of that money goes to interest groups which engage in political activity and issue advocacy at the taxpayers' expense. This is an intolerable abuse of the public's money. A Republican Congress will enact legislation, currently blocked by Bill Clinton's congressional allies, to make groups choose between grants and lobbying. We will establish Truth in Testimony, requiring organizations which receive government funds and testify before Congress to disclose those funds. Our ""Let America Know"" legislation will force public disclosure of all taxpayer subsidies and lobbying by groups seeking grants. We will permit ""private attorney general"" lawsuits against federal grantees to ensure better enforcement of anti lobbying restrictions. A Republican administration will impose accountability on grantees, to reveal what the public is getting for its money, and will end the process of automatic grant renewal. We will halt the funding of frivolous and politicized research grants. Streamlining Government Republicans believe we can streamline government and make it more effective through competition and privatization. We applaud the Republican Congress and Republican officials across the country for initiatives to expand the use of competition and privatization in government. It is greater competition - not unchallenged government bureaucracies - that will cut the cost of government, improve the delivery of services, and ensure wise investment in infrastructure. A Dole administration will make competition a centerpiece of government, eliminating duplication and increasing efficiency. Honest Budgets and Real Numbers We have a moral responsibility not to leave our children a legacy of monstrous debt. Spending $1.6 trillion a year should be more than an accounting exercise. Restraining government spending, discussed elsewhere in this platform, is part of the solution. Reforming the entire budget process is the rest of it. Our goal is clarity, simplicity, and accountability in the nation's budget. The keystone of that agenda is the enactment of a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget which a majority of congressional Democrats have vigorously opposed. We do not take that step lightly; but then, a $5 trillion debt is no laughing matter for tomorrow's taxpayers. We vow to offer that amendment again and again, until Congress sends it to the States for ratification. In addition, we must eliminate all built-in biases toward spending. For example, the ""current service baseline"" builds in automatic budget increases for inflation and other factors and works like this: If the Democrats want a $1 billion program to grow to $2 billion, they then count an increase to $1.5 billion as a half-billion dollar cut - and the media dutifully reports it as such. This is a deceptive and reprehensible shell game that must be stopped. A Republican president will fight wasteful spending with the line-item veto which was finally enacted by congressional Republicans this year over bitter Democrat opposition, 120 years after President Grant first proposed it. Even more important, we will stop the runaway growth of entitlement spending - the programs which automatically grow without any action required by Congress or the President. This spending has jumped 11-fold since 1970 and consumes more than half the federal budget. We will take entitlements off automatic pilot and make Congress accountable for their funding. To end outdated and wasteful programs, we will make the Government Performance and Results Act an integral part of our budget process. Regulatory Reform Regulatory reform is needed more than ever. Bill Clinton promised to ""reinvent government,"" but he returned to the old mindset of controls and red tape. To make matters worse, he vetoed a comprehensive regulatory reform bill crafted by Republicans in the House and Senate. That measure will become law when Bob Dole is President. We commend House Speaker Newt Gingrich and congressional Republicans in their innovative efforts to rescind, overturn and zero-out absurd bureaucratic red tape and rules through the process known as ""Corrections Day."" A Republican administration will require periodic review of existing regulations to ensure they are effective and do away with obsolete and conflicting rules. We will encourage civil servants to find ways to reduce regulatory burdens on the public and will require federal agencies to disclose the costs of new regulations on individuals and small businesses. A new regulatory budget will reveal the total cost of regulations on the American people. We will target resources on the most serious risks to health, safety, and the environment, rather than on politically inspired causes, and will require peer-reviewed risk assessments based on sound science. We will require agencies to conduct cost-benefit analyses of their regulations and pursue alternatives to the outdated Clinton command-and-control approach. These common-sense reforms will restore fairness and predictability to government rules and, even more important, will enable us to achieve equal or superior levels of protection for the public at lower cost. Just as important, we recognize that all too often, in its ever-present zeal to expand into every aspect of our daily lives, the federal government intrudes into the private economy by establishing new services in direct competition with already existing private firms. We oppose the use of taxpayer funds to provide a competitive advantage for government agencies seeking to compete with private firms in the free market. Restoring Justice to the Courts ""When I am president, only conservative judges need apply."" Bob Dole, May 28, 1996, in Aurora, Colorado The American people have lost faith in their courts, and for good reason. Some members of the federal judiciary threaten the safety, the values, and the freedom of law-abiding citizens. They make up laws and invent new rights as they go along, arrogating to themselves powers King George III never dared to exercise. They free vicious criminals, pamper felons in prison, frivolously overturn State laws enacted by citizen referenda, and abdicate the responsibility of providing meaningful review of administrative decisions. The delicate balance of power between the respective branches of our national government and the governments of the 50 states has been eroded. The notion of judicial review has in some cases come to resemble judicial supremacy, affecting all segments of public and private endeavor. Make no mistake, the separation of powers doctrine, complete and unabridged, is the linchpin of a government of laws. A Republican Congress and president will restore true separation of powers and guarantee the American people a government of law. The federal judiciary, including the U.S. Supreme Court, has overstepped its authority under the Constitution. It has usurped the right of citizen legislators and popularly elected executives to make law by declaring duly enacted laws to be ""unconstitutional"" through the misapplication of the principle of judicial review. Any other role for the judiciary, especially when personal preferences masquerade as interpreting the law, is fundamentally at odds with our system of government in which the people and their representatives decide issues great and small. No systemic reform of the judiciary can substitute for the wise exercise of power of appointment vested in the president of the United States. A Republican president will ensure that a process is established to select for the federal judiciary nominees who understand that their task is first and foremost to be faithful to the Constitution and to the intent of those who framed it. In that process, the American Bar Association will no longer have the right to meddle in a way that distorts a nominee's credentials and advances the liberal agenda of litigious lawyers and their allies. Justice is mocked by some of today's litigation practices, which hinder our country's competitiveness, and drain billions of dollars away from productive Americans. While we fully support the role of the judiciary in vindicating the constitutional and statutory rights of individuals and organizations, we believe the proliferation of litigation hits the consumer with higher prices and cripples the practice of medicine. Despite bipartisan congressional efforts to enact legal reforms, Bill Clinton vetoed such legislation at the behest of his financial friends: the trial lawyers. A Republican president will sign that bill, and more. We encourage State governments to adopt reforms similar to those we propose to restore fairness to the federal system: -- strengthen judicial sanctions for lawsuits that are substantially without merit, thereby hitting unethical lawyers in their pocketbooks; -- apply the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law (RICO) as originally intended, to criminal proceedings, not civil litigation; -- award punitive damages on a fair and reasonable basis after clear proof of wrongdoing, with limits that discourage opportunistic litigation. Since punitive damages are intended to punish egregious wrongdoing, a substantial portion of the amount awarded should go to a crime-victim compensation fund or similar program; -- restore limited liability to non-profit organizations - churches, civic and community groups, and the volunteers who sustain them - to provide protection against profit-seeking lawsuits and to encourage volunteerism; -- increase sanctions for abuses of the discovery process used to intimidate opponents and drive up the costs of litigation; -- reform medical malpractice to reduce health care costs and keep doctors practicing in critical areas like obstetrics; -- eliminate the use of ""junk science"" by opportunistic attorneys by requiring courts to verify that the science of those called as expert witnesses is reasonably acceptable within the scientific community, and forbid the practice of making their fees conditional upon a favorable verdict. This action will reduce the practice of so-called hired-gun ""experts"" who make up theories to fit the facts of the case in which they are testifying; -- eliminate joint and several liability in order to ensure that responsible parties pay their ""fair share"" in proportion to their degree of fault; and -- guard against non-meritorious lawsuits that are designed to have a chilling effect on First Amendment rights. A federal products liability law goes hand in hand with legal reform. Its absence not only penalizes consumers with higher costs and keeps needed products off the market, but also gives foreign nations a competitive edge over American workers. Bill Clinton doesn't mind that. He vetoed Republican reforms that would have saved the public tens of billions of dollars. Bill Clinton even vetoed the Securities Litigation Reform Act, a Republican initiative to protect shareholders against avaricious litigation. That obstructionism was too much for even the Democrats in Congress, many of whom joined in overriding his veto. A Republican president will work with Congress to restore justice to the nation's courts and fair play to the practice of law. The Nation's Capital The District of Columbia should be an example for the rest of the country. Instead, decades of domination by the Democrat party has left the city bankrupt and dangerous. Its residents - and all Americans - deserve better than that. We reaffirm the constitutional status of the District of Columbia as the seat of government of the United States and reject calls for statehood for the District. We call for structural reform of the city's government and its education system. For both efficiency and public safety, we will transfer water and sewer management in the District to the Army Corps of Engineers or to a regional entity. We endorse proposals by the congressional Republican Leadership for dramatic reductions in federal taxes - and the city's own outrageous marginal tax rate - within the District. Bill Clinton opposes that idea. A Republican president will make it part of a comprehensive agenda to transform the nation's capital into a renewal community, an enterprise zone leading the way for the rest of urban America to follow. Americans in the Territories We welcome greater participation in all aspects of the political process by Americans residing in Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Northern Marianas, and Puerto Rico. No single approach can meet the needs of those diverse communities. We therefore emphasize respect for their wishes regarding their relationship to the rest of the Union. We affirm their right to seek the full extension of the Constitution, with all the rights and responsibilities it entails. We support the Native American Samoans' efforts to preserve their culture and land-tenure system, which fosters self-reliance and strong extended family values. We recognize that the people of Guam have voted for a closer relationship with the United States of America, and we affirm our support of their right to mutually improve their political relationship through commonwealth. We support the right of the United States citizens of Puerto Rico to be admitted to the Union as a fully sovereign state after they freely so determine. We endorse initiatives of the congressional Republican leadership to provide for Puerto Rico's smooth transition to statehood if its citizens choose to alter their current status, or to set them on their own path to become an independent nation. INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND PERSONAL SAFETY ""We are discovering as a nation that many of our deepest social problems are problems of character and belief. We will never solve those problems until the hearts of parents are turned toward their children; until respect is restored for life and property; until a commitment is renewed to love and serve our neighbor. The common good requires that goodness be common."" Bob Dole, May 23, 1996 in Philadelphia Upholding the Rights of All This section of our platform deals with rights and responsibilities. But it deals also with something larger: the common good, our shared sense of what makes a society decent and noble. That takes us beyond government policies and programs to what we are as a people, and what we want to be. We are the party of the open door. As we approach the start of a new century, the Republican Party is more dedicated than ever to strengthening the social, cultural, and political ties that bind us together as a free people, the greatest force for good the world has ever seen. While our party remains steadfast in its commitment to advancing its historic principles and ideals, we also recognize that members of our party have deeply held and sometimes differing views. We view this diversity of views as a source of strength, not as a sign of weakness, and we welcome into our ranks all Americans who may hold differing positions. We are committed to resolving our differences in a spirit of civility, hope, and mutual respect. Americans do not want to be afraid of those they pass on the street, suspicious of strangers, fearful for their children. They do not want to have to fight a constant battle against brutality and degradation in what passes for entertainment. We oppose sexual harassment in the workplace, and must ensure that no one in America is forced to choose between a job and submitting to unwelcome advances. We also oppose indoctrination in the classroom. Americans should not have to tolerate the decline of ethical standards and the collapse of behavioral norms. Most important, they should not have to doubt the truthfulness of their elected leaders. Reversing those trends won't be easy, but our homes and our children are worth the effort. Government has a small, but vital, role. But most of the burden must be ours: as parents, as consumers, as citizens whose right of free speech empowers us to stand up for the weak and vulnerable - and speak out against the profiteers of violence and moral decay. That needs to be done, both in our house and in the White House. Bill Clinton can't - or won't - do it. So we will do it without him, and with new national leadership of character and conscience. We are the party of individual Americans, whose rights we protect and defend as the foundation for opportunity and security for all. Today, as at our founding in the day of Lincoln, we insist no one's rights are negotiable. As we strive to forge a national consensus on the divisive issues of our time, we call on all Republicans and all Americans to reject the forces of hatred and bigotry. Accordingly, we denounce all who practice or promote racism, anti-Semitism, ethnic prejudice, and religious intolerance. We condemn attempts by the EEOC or any other arm of government to regulate or ban religious symbols from the work place, and we assert the right of religious leaders to speak out on public issues. We condemn the desecration of places of worship and are proud that congressional Republicans led the fight against church arsons. We believe religious institutions and schools should not be taxed. When government funds privately operated social, welfare, or educational programs, it must not discriminate against religious institutions, whose record in providing services to those in need far exceeds that of the public sector. The sole source of equal opportunity for all is equality before the law. Therefore, we oppose discrimination based on sex, race, age, creed, or national origin and will vigorously enforce anti discrimination statutes. We reject the distortion of those laws to cover sexual preference, and we endorse the Defense of Marriage Act to prevent states from being forced to recognize same-sex unions. Because we believe rights inhere in individuals, not in groups, we will attain our nation's goal of equal rights without quotas or other forms of preferential treatment. We scorn Bill Clinton's notion that any person should be denied a job, promotion, contract or a chance at higher education because of their race or gender. Instead, we endorse the Dole-Canady Equal Opportunity Act to end discrimination by the federal government. We likewise endorse this year's Proposition 209, the California Civil Rights Initiative, to restore to law the original meaning of civil rights. We renew our historic Republican commitment to equal opportunity for women. In the early days of the suffragist movement, we pioneered the women's right to vote. We take pride in this year's remarkable array of Republican women serving in and running for office and their role in leadership positions in our party, in Congress, and in the states. Two women serve in our House Leadership - a record untouched by the Democrats during their 40 years in power. The full exercise of legal rights depends upon opportunity, and economic growth is the key to continuing progress for women in all fields of endeavor. Public policy must respect and accommodate women whether they are full-time homemakers or pursue a career. Under Senator Dole's sponsorship, the Americans with Disabilities Act was enacted to ensure full participation by disabled citizens in our country's life. Republicans emphasize community integration and inclusion of persons with disabilities, both by personal example and by practical enforcement of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Air Carriers Access Act, and other laws. We will safeguard the interests of disabled persons in Medicare and Medicaid, as well as in federal work force programs. Under a Republican renewal, the abilities of all will be needed in an expanding economy, which alone can carry forward the assistive technology that offers personal progress for everyone. We support full access to the polls, and the entire political process, by disabled citizens. We oppose the non-consensual withholding of health care or treatment because of handicap, age, or infirmity, just as we oppose euthanasia and assisted suicide, which, especially for the poor and those on the margins of society, threaten the sanctity of human life. The unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and we endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children. Our purpose is to have legislative and judicial protection of that right against those who perform abortions. We oppose using public revenues for abortion and will not fund organizations which advocate it. We support the appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life. Our goal is to ensure that women with problem pregnancies have the kind of support, material and otherwise, they need for themselves and for their babies, not to be punitive towards those for whose difficult situation we have only compassion. We oppose abortion, but our pro-life agenda does not include punitive action against women who have an abortion. We salute those who provide alternatives to abortion and offer adoption services. Republicans in Congress took the lead in expanding assistance both for the costs of adoption and for the continuing care of adoptive children with special needs. Bill Clinton vetoed our adoption tax credit the first time around - and opposed our efforts to remove racial barriers to adoption - before joining in this long overdue measure of support for adoptive families. Worse than that, he vetoed the ban on partial-birth abortions, a procedure denounced by a committee of the American Medical Association and rightly branded as four-fifths infanticide. We applaud Bob Dole's commitment to revoke the Clinton executive orders concerning abortion and to sign into law an end to partial-birth abortions. We reaffirm the promise of the Fifth Amendment: ""nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."" This Takings Clause protects the homes and livelihood of Americans against the governmental greed and abuse of power that characterizes the Clinton Administration; we will strictly enforce it. We defend the constitutional right to keep and bear arms. We will promote training in the safe usage of firearms, especially in programs for women and the elderly. We strongly support Bob Dole's National Instant Check Initiative, which will help keep all guns out of the hands of convicted felons. The point-of-purchase instant check has worked well in many states and now it is time to extend this system all across America. We applaud Bob Dole's commitment to have the national instant check system operational by the end of 1997. In one of the strangest actions of his tenure, Bill Clinton abolished Operation Triggerlock, the Republican initiative to jail any felon caught with a gun. We will restore that effort and will set by law minimum mandatory penalties for the use of guns in committing a crime: 5 years for possession, 10 years for brandishing, and 20 for discharge. We affirm the right of individuals to participate in labor organizations and to bargain collectively, consistent with State laws. Because that participation should always be voluntary. we support the right of States to enact Right-to-Work laws. We will restore the original scope of the Hobbs Act, barring union officials from extortion and violence. We will vigorously implement the Supreme Court's Beck decision to ensure that workers are not compelled to subsidize political activity, like the $35 million slush fund extorted this year from rank and file members by Washington-based labor leaders. We will reverse Bill Clinton's unconscionable Executive order that deprived workers of their right to know how their union dues are spent. A Sensible Immigration Policy As a nation of immigrants, we welcome those who follow our laws and come to our land to seek a better life. New Americans strengthen our economy, enrich our culture, and defend the nation in war and in peace. At the same time, we are determined to reform the system by which we welcome them to the American family. We must set immigration at manageable levels, balance the competing goals of uniting families of our citizens and admitting specially talented persons, and end asylum abuses through expedited exclusion of false claimants. Bill Clinton's immigration record does not match his rhetoric. While talking tough on illegal immigration, he has proposed a reduction in the number of border patrol agents authorized by the Republicans in Congress, has opposed the most successful border control program in decades (Operation Hold the Line in Texas), has opposed Proposition 187 in California which 60 percent of Californians supported, and has opposed Republican efforts to ensure that non-citizens do not take advantage of expensive welfare programs. Unlike Bill Clinton, we stand with the American people on immigration policy and will continue to reform and enforce our immigration laws to ensure that they reflect America's national interest. We also support efforts to secure our borders from the threat of illegal immigration. Illegal immigration has reached crisis proportions, with more than four million illegal aliens now present in the United States. That number, growing by 300,000 each year, burdens taxpayers, strains public services, takes jobs, and increases crime. Republicans in both the House and Senate have passed bills that tighten border enforcement, speed up deportation of criminal aliens, toughen penalties for overstaying visas, and streamline the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Illegal aliens should not receive public benefits other than emergency aid, and those who become parents while illegally in the United States should not be qualified to claim benefits for their offspring. Legal immigrants should depend for assistance on their sponsors, who are legally responsible for their financial well-being, not the American taxpayers. Just as we require ""deadbeat dads"" to provide for the children they bring into the world, we should require ""deadbeat sponsors"" to provide for the immigrants they bring into the country. We support a constitutional amendment or constitutionally-valid legislation declaring that children born in the United States of parents who are not legally present in the United States or who are not long-term residents are not automatically citizens. We endorse the Dole/Coverdell proposal to make crimes of domestic violence, stalking, child abuse, child neglect and child abandonment committed by aliens residing in this country deportable offenses under our immigration laws. We call for harsh penalties against exploiters who smuggle illegal aliens and for those who profit from the production of false documents. Republicans believe that by eliminating the magnet for illegal immigration, increasing border security, enforcing our immigration laws, and producing counterfeit-proof documents, we will finally put an end to the illegal immigration crisis. We oppose the creation of any national ID card. From Many, One America's ethnic diversity within a shared national culture is one of our country's greatest strengths. While we benefit from our differences, we must also strengthen the ties that bind us to one another. Foremost among those is the flag. Its deliberate desecration is not ""free speech,"" but an assault against our history and our hopes. We support a constitutional amendment that will restore to the people, through their elected representatives, their right to safeguard Old Glory. We condemn Bill Clinton's refusal, once again, to protect and preserve the most precious symbol of our Republic. English, our common language, provides a shared foundation which has allowed people from every corner of the world to come together to build the American nation. The use of English is indispensable to all who wish to participate fully in our society and realize the American dream. As Bob Dole has said: ""For more than two centuries now, English has been a force for unity, indispensable to the process of transforming untold millions of immigrants from all parts of the globe into citizens of the most open and free society the world has ever seen."" For newcomers, learning the English language has always been the fastest route to the mainstream of American life. That should be the goal of bilingual education programs. We support the official recognition of English as the nation's common language. We advocate foreign language training in our schools and retention of heritage languages in homes and cultural institutions. Foreign language fluency is also an essential component of America's competitiveness in the world market. We will strengthen Native Americans' self-determination by respecting tribal sovereignty, encouraging a pro-business and pro-development climate on reservations. We uphold the unique government-to-government relationship between the tribes and the United States, and we honor our nation's trust obligations to them. In fulfillment thereof, we will ensure that the resources, financial and otherwise, which the United States holds in trust are well-managed, audited, and protected. We second Bob Dole's call for legislation authorizing tribal governments to reorganize the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service. We endorse efforts to ensure equitable participation in federal programs by Native Americans, Native Alaskans and Native Hawaiians and to preserve their culture and languages. Getting Tough on Crime ""Women in America know better than anyone about the randomness and ruthlessness of crime. It is a shameful, national disgrace that nightfall has become synonymous with fear for so many of America's women."" Bob Dole, May 28, 1996 in Aurora, Colorado During Bill Clinton's tenure, America has become a more fearful place, especially for the elderly and for women and children. Violent crime has turned our homes into prisons, our streets and schoolyards into battlegrounds. It devours half a trillion dollars every year. Unfortunately, far worse could be coming in the near future. While we acknowledge the extraordinary efforts of single parents, we recognize that a generation of fatherless boys raises the prospect of soaring juvenile crime. This is, in part the legacy of liberalism - in the old Democrat Congress, in the Clinton Department of Justice, and in the courts, where judges appointed by Democrat presidents continue their assault against the rights of law-abiding Americans. For too long government policy has been controlled by criminals and their defense lawyers. Democrat Congresses cared more about rights of criminals than safety for Americans. Bill Clinton arbitrarily closed off Pennsylvania Avenue, the nation's Main Street, for his protection, while his policies left the public unprotected against vicious criminals. As a symbol of our determination to restore the rule of law - in the White House as well as in our streets - we will reopen Pennsylvania Avenue. After the elections of 1994, the new Republican majorities in the House and Senate fought back with legislation that ends frivolous, costly, and unnecessarily lengthy death-row appeals, requires criminals to pay restitution to their victims, speeds the removal of criminal aliens, and steps up the fight against terrorism. Congressional Republicans put into law a truth-in-sentencing prison grant program to provide incentives to states which enact laws requiring violent felons to serve at least 85% of their sentences and replaced a myriad of Democrat ""Washington knows best"" prevention programs with bloc grants to cities and counties to use to fight crime as they see fit. They put an end to federal court early-release orders for prison overcrowding and made it much harder for prisoners to file frivolous lawsuits about prison conditions. There's more to do, once Bill Clinton's veto threats no longer block the way. We will establish no frills prisons where prisoners are required to work productively and make the threat of jail a real deterrent to crime. Prisons should not be places of rest and relaxation. We will reform the Supreme Court's fanciful exclusionary rule, which has allowed a generation of criminals to get off on technicalities. Juvenile crime is one of the most difficult challenges facing our nation. The juvenile justice system is broken. It fails to punish the minor crimes that lead to larger offenses, and lacks early intervention to keep delinquency from turning into violent crime. Truancy laws are not enforced, positive role models are lacking, and parental responsibility is overlooked. We will stress accountability at every step in the system and require adult trials for juveniles who commit adult crimes. In addition, not only is juvenile crime on the rise, but unsupervised juveniles (especially at night) are most often the victims of abuse in our society. Recognizing that local jurisdictions have a clear and concise understanding of their problems, we encourage them to develop and enact innovative programs to address juvenile crime. We also encourage them to consider juvenile nocturnal curfews as an effective law enforcement tool in helping reduce juvenile crime and juvenile victimization. Juvenile criminal proceedings should be open to victims and the public. Juvenile conviction records should not be sealed but made available to law enforcement agencies, the courts, and those who hire for sensitive work in schools and day-care centers. Because liberal jurists keep expanding the rights of the accused, Republicans propose a Constitutional amendment to protect victims' rights: audio and visual testimony of victims kept on file for future hearings, full restitution, protection from intimidation or violence by the offender, notification of court proceedings, a chance to be heard in plea bargains, the right to remain in court during trials and hearings concerning the crimes committed against them, a voice in the sentencing proceedings, notice of the release or escape of offenders. Bill Clinton hypocritically endorsed our Victim's Rights Amendment while naming judges who opposed capital punishment, turned felons loose, and even excused murder as a form of social protest. Bob Dole, the next Republican president will end that nonsense and make our courts once again an instrument of justice. While the federal government's role is essential, most law enforcement must remain in the hands of local communities, directed by State and local officials who are closely answerable to the people whose lives are affected by crime. In that regard, we support community policing; nothing inhibits local crime like an officer in the neighborhood. Bill Clinton promised 100,000 more police officers on the beat but, according to his own Attorney General, delivered no more than 17,000. He ignored local law enforcers by tying the program in knots of red tape and high costs. Now he is diverting millions of its dollars, appropriated by congressional Republicans to fight street crime, to state parks and environmental projects. It's time to return those anti-crime resources to communities and let them decide what works best to keep their homes, schools, and workplaces safe. This would result in far more new police officers than Bill Clinton's program and give communities additional crime fighting resources they need. We will work with local authorities to prevent prison inmates from receiving disability or other government entitlements while incarcerated. We support efforts to allow peace officers, including qualified retirees, to assist their colleagues and protect their communities even when they are out of their home jurisdictions to the extent this is consistent with applicable state and local law. We will amend the Fair Labor Standards Act so that corrections officers can volunteer to assist local law enforcement. Crimes against women and children demand an emphatic response. Under Bob Dole and Dick Zimmer's leadership, Republicans in Congress pushed through Megan's Law - the requirement that local communities be notified when sex offenders and kidnappers are released - in response to the growing number of violent sexual assaults and murders like the brutal murder of a little girl in New Jersey. We call for special penalties against thugs who assault or batter pregnant women and harm them or their unborn children. We endorse Bob Dole's call to bring federal penalties for child pornography in line with far tougher State penalties: ten years for a first offense, fifteen for the second, and life for a third. We believe it is time to revisit the Supreme Court's arbitrary decision of 1977 that protects even the most vicious rapists from the death penalty. Bob Dole authored a tough federal statute which provides for the admissibility of prior similar criminal acts of defendants in sexual assault cases. This important law enforcement tool should serve as a model for the states. We continue our strong support of capital punishment for those who commit heinous federal crimes; including the kingpins of the narcotics trade. We wish to express our support and sympathy for all victims of terrorism and their families. Acts of terrorism against Americans and American interests must be stopped and those who commit them must be brought to justice. We recommend a Presidentially appointed ""blue ribbon"" commission to study more effective methods of prosecuting terrorists. Only Republican resolve can prepare our nation to deal with the four deadly threats facing us in the early years of the 21st Century: violent crime, drugs, terrorism, and international organized crime. Those perils are interlocked - and all are escalating. This is no time for excuses. It's time for a change. Solving the Drug Crisis The verdict is in on Bill Clinton's moral leadership: after 11 years of steady decline, the use of marijuana among teens doubled in the two years after 1992. At the same time, the use of cocaine and methamphetamines dramatically increased. That shocks but should not surprise. For in the war on drugs - an essential component of the fight against crime - today's Democratic Party has been a conscientious objector. Nowhere is the discrepancy between Bill Clinton's rhetoric and his actions more apparent. Mr. Clinton's personal record has been a betrayal of the nation's trust, sending the worst possible signal to the nation's youth. At the urging of the Secret Service, the White House had to institute a drug-testing program for Clinton staffers who were known to be recent users of illegal narcotics. At the same time, he drastically cut funding for drug interdiction. The Office of National Drug Control Policy was cut by 80 percent, and federal drug prosecutions dropped 25 percent. His Attorney General proposed to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug trafficking and related crimes, and his Surgeon General advocated legalization of narcotics. Hundreds of suspected drug smugglers have been allowed to go free at the border. Simultaneously, the use of marijuana, cocaine, and heroin has increased, especially among young people. Now narcotics are again fueling the acceleration of crime rates, putting the nation on a collision course with the future. Bill Clinton's weakness in international affairs has worsened the situation here at home. One case in point: He certified that Mexico has cooperated with our drug interdiction effort when 70 percent of drugs smuggled into the U. S. come across our southern border - and when the Mexican government ignored 165 extradition orders for drug criminals. Discredited at home and abroad, he lacks both the stature and the credibility to lead us toward a drug-free America. A war against drugs requires moral leadership now lacking in the White House. Throughout the 1980s, the Republican approach - no legalization, no tolerance, no excuses - turned the tide against drug abuse. We can do it again by emphasizing prevention, interdiction, a tough international approach, and a crack-down on users. That requires reversing one of Bill Clinton's most offensive actions: his shocking purge of every U. S. Attorney in the country shortly after he took office. This unprecedented firing destroyed our first line of defense against drug traffickers and other career criminals. Our country's most experienced and dedicated prosecutors were replaced with Clintonite liberals, some of whom have refused to prosecute major drug dealers, foreign narcotics smugglers, and child pornographers. In a Dole Administration, U. S. Attorneys will prosecute and jail those who prey upon the innocent. We support upgrading our interdiction effort by establishing a Deputy Commissioner for Drug Enforcement within the Customs Service. We will intensify our intelligence efforts against international drug traffickers and use whatever means necessary to destroy their operations and seize their personal accounts. We support strong penalties, including mandatory minimum sentences, for drug trafficking, distribution and drug-related crimes. Drug use is closely related to crime and recidivism. Drug testing should be made a routine feature of the criminal justice process at every stage, including the juvenile justice system. Test results should be used in deciding pretrial release, sentencing, and probation revocation. A safer America must include highways without drunk or drug-impaired drivers. We support the toughest possible State laws to deal with drivers impaired by substance abuse and advocate federal cooperation, not compulsion, toward that end. The Bottom Line: From The Top Down Making America safe again will be a tremendous undertaking, in its own way as heroic as was the liberation of Europe from a different kind of criminal half a century ago. At the grassroots, that crusade already has enlisted the men and women of local law enforcement. Now they need a leader worthy of their cause - someone whose life reflects respect for the law, not evasion of it. Bill Clinton need not apply. Bob Dole will be a president committed to the protection and safety of all Americans. However, his strength is diminished without a court system supportive of the national fight against violent crime. That is the bottom line of this year's presidential election: Who should chart the course of law enforcement for the next generation by naming as many as an additional 30 percent of our federal judges and the next several justices to the U. S. Supreme Court? Bill Clinton, the master of excuse and evasion? Or Bob Dole, whose life has been an exercise in honor and duty? FAMILIES AND SOCIETY ""The alternative to cold bureaucracy is not indifference. It is the warmth of families and neighborhoods, charities, churches, synagogues and communities. These value-shaping institutions have the tools to reclaim lives - individual responsibility, tough love, and spiritual renewal. They do more than care for the body; they restore the spirit."" Bob Dole, May 23, 1996, in Philadelphia Stronger Families We are the party of the American family, educating children, caring for the sick, learning from the elderly, and helping the less fortunate. We believe that strengthening family life is the best way to improve the quality of life for everyone. Families foster the virtues that make a free society strong. We rely on the home and its supportive institutions to instill honesty, self-discipline, mutual respect and the other virtues that sustain democracy. Our goal is to promote those values by respecting the rights of families and by assisting, where appropriate, the institutions which mediate between government and the home. While recognizing a role for government in dealing with social ills, we look to mediating institutions - religious and community groups, private associations of all kinds - to take the lead in tackling the social ills that some government programs have only worsened. This is the clearest distinction between Republicans and Clinton Democrats: We believe the family is the core institution of our society. Bill Clinton thinks government should hold that place. It's little wonder, then, that today's families feel under siege. They seem to work harder with less reward for their labor. They can no longer expect that life will be better for their children than it was for them. Their problem starts in the White House. Bill Clinton has hit families with higher taxes, vetoed their tax relief, and given their money to special interest groups. He has meddled in their schools, fought family choice in education, and promoted lifestyles inimical to their values. He repeatedly vetoed pro-family welfare reforms before surrendering to the demands of the American people. He tried to impose a ruinous government takeover of health care; led a scare campaign against Republican efforts to preserve, protect, and strengthen Medicare; and appointed to major positions in his administration social theorists whose bizarre views are alien to those of most Americans. Republicans want to get our society back on track - toward good schools with great teachers, welfare that really helps, and health care responsive to the needs of people, not government. We want to make sure our most important programs - like Social Security and Medicare - are there when people need them. In all those cases, we start with the family as the building block of a safe and caring society. Our agenda for more secure families runs throughout this platform. Here we take special notice of the way congressional Republicans have advanced adoption assistance, promoted foster care reform, and fought the marriage penalty in the tax code. They have worked to let parents have flex time and comp-time in private industry, and have safeguarded family choice in child care against the Democrats' attempts to control it. They passed the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines ""marriage"" for purposes of federal law as the legal union of one man and one woman and prevents federal judges and bureaucrats from forcing states to recognize other living arrangements as ""marriages."" Further, they have advanced the Family Rights and Privacy Act - a bill of rights against the intrusions of big government and its grantees. In the House and Senate, Republicans have championed the economic rights of the family and made a $500 per child tax credit the centerpiece of their reform agenda. But that overdue measure of relief for households with children was vetoed. We salute parents working at the State level to ensure constitutional protection for the rights of the family. We urge State legislators to review divorce laws to foster the stability of the home and protect the economic rights of the innocent spouse and children. Improving Education ""At the center of all that afflicts our schools is a denial of free choice. Our public schools are in trouble because they are no longer run by the public. Instead, they're controlled by narrow special interest groups who regard public education not as a public trust, but as political territory to be guarded at all costs."" Bob Dole, July 17, 1996, in Minneapolis The American people know that something is terribly wrong with our education system. The evidence is everywhere: children who cannot read, graduates who cannot reason, danger in schoolyards, indoctrination in classrooms. To this crisis in our schools, Bill Clinton responds with the same liberal dogmas that created the mess: more federal control and more spending on all the wrong things. He opposes family rights in education and opportunity scholarships for poor children. When it comes to saving our schools, he flunks. Americans should have the best education in the world. We spend more per pupil than any other nation, and the great majority of our teachers are dedicated and skilled educators, whose interests are ignored by political union bosses. Our goal is nothing less than a renaissance in American education, begun by returning its control to parents, teachers, local school boards and, through them, to communities and local taxpayers. Our formula is as simple as it is sweeping: the federal government has no constitutional authority to be involved in school curricula or to control jobs in the work place. That is why we will abolish the Department of Education, end federal meddling in our schools, and promote family choice at all levels of learning. We therefore call for prompt repeal of the Goals 2000 program and the School To-Work Act of 1994, which put new federal controls, as well as unfunded mandates, on the States. We further urge that federal attempts to impose outcome- or performance-based education on local schools be ended. We know what works in education, and it isn't the liberal fads of the last thirty years. It's discipline, parental involvement, emphasis on basics including computer technology, phonics instead of look-say reading, and dedicated teaching. Abstinence education in the home will lead to less need for birth control services and fewer abortions. We support educational initiatives to promote chastity until marriage as the expected standard of behavior. This education initiative is the best preventive measure to avoid the emotional trauma of sexually-transmitted diseases and teen pregnancies that are serious problems among our young people. While recognizing that something must be done to help children when parental consent or supervision is not possible, we oppose school-based clinics, which provide referrals, counseling, and related services for contraception and abortion. We encourage a reform agenda on the local level and urge State legislators to ensure quality education for all through programs of parental choice among public, private, and religious schools. That includes the option of home schooling, and Republicans will defend the right of families to make that choice. We support and vigorously work for mechanisms, such as opportunity scholarships, block grants, school rebates, charter schools, and vouchers, to make parental choice in education a reality for all parents. On the federal level, we endorse legislation - like the Watts-Talent Low-Income Educational Opportunity Act, which is part of the Community Renewal Act of 1996, and the Coats-Kasich Educational Choice and Equity Act - to set up model programs for empowering the families who need good schooling the most. We will continue to work for the return of voluntary prayer to our schools and will strongly enforce the Republican legislation that guarantees equal access to school facilities by student religious groups. We encourage State legislatures to pass statutes which prohibit local school boards from adopting policies of denial regarding voluntary school prayer. We endorse Bob Dole's pledge that all federal education policies will be guided by his Education Consumer's Warranty. The Education Consumer's Warranty says that all American children should expect to: -- attend a safe school; -- be free from educational malpractice at the hands of bad schools, incompetent teachers, timid principals, and intrusive bureaucrats; -- find out exactly how well they and their school are doing (in terms of achievement) in relation to how well they ought to be doing; -- learn the three R's through proven methods; -- learn the nation's history and democratic values and study the classics of western civilization; -- attend a school that is free to innovate and isn't tied down by federal red tape; -- be confident that their high school diploma signifies a solid education, suitable for college or a good job; -- choose the school that's right for them; -- know that their tax dollars are reaching the classroom, not being siphoned off into overhead and bureaucracy; and, -- count on being able to arrive at college prepared to do freshman-level work. To reinforce our American heritage, we believe our nation's Governors, State legislators, and local school boards should support requiring our public schools to dedicate one full day each year solely to studying the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. America's families find themselves on a college treadmill: the more they work to pay tuition, the faster it seems to increase. Tuition has escalated far in excess of inflation, in defiance of market factors, and shows no sign of slowing down. Billions of dollars are wasted on regulations, paperwork, and ""political correctness,"" which impedes the ability of the faculty to teach. We call for a national reassessment of the economics of higher education, to stop the treadmill and restore fiscal accountability to higher education. Congressional Republicans budgeted a 50 percent increase in student loans while fighting Bill Clinton's intrusion of Big Government into their financing. Heeding the outcry from the nation's campuses, we will end the Clinton Administration's perverse direct lending program. We support proposals to assist families to prepare for the financial strains of higher education, like the American Dream Savings Account, passed by congressional Republicans but vetoed. To protect the nation's colleges and universities against intolerance, we will work with independent educators to create alternatives to ideological accrediting bodies. We believe meeting the higher education needs of America will require new, public and private institutions that are flexible, able to apply new technologies, willing to provide access to all those who need it, cost-effective and that place no burden on the American taxpayer. Improving America's Health Care Our goal is to maintain the quality of America's health care - the best in the world, bar none - while making health care and health insurance more accessible and more affordable. That means allowing health care providers to respond to consumer demand through consumer choice. That approach stands in stark contrast to Bill Clinton's health plan of 1993. ""Clintoncare"" would have been a poison pill for the nation's health care system. Congressional Republicans countered with the right prescription: -- make insurance portable from job to job; -- ensure that persons are not denied coverage because of preexisting health conditions when changing employment; -- crack down on Medicare and Medicaid fraud, while preserving the confidentiality of medical records from inappropriate scrutiny and without imposing criminal penalties for clerical errors and billing mistakes; -- reform malpractice laws, to reduce the costly practice of ""defensive medicine"" and to make it easier for doctors to specialize in fields like obstetrics. We also recognize the vital importance of maintaining the confidentiality of the national practitioners data base; -- let individuals set up tax-free Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs), so they can plan for their own medical needs instead of relying on government or insurance companies. Republicans believe that Medicare and Medicaid recipients should also have the option to utilize Medical Savings Accounts, which would result in huge savings for the American taxpayers; -- overhaul the Food and Drug Administration to get better products on the market faster and at less cost to consumers; -- change IRS rules that restrict coverage: let employer groups offer tax-exempt policies and make premiums 100% deductible for farmers, small businesses, and all the self-employed; -- promote a private market for long-term care insurance; -- reduce paperwork through electronic billing; -- change anti-trust laws to let health care providers cooperate in holding down charges; -- avoid mandatory coverages that make consumers pay for more insurance than they need; -- allow multi-employer purchasing groups and form ""risk pools"" in the States to make employee health insurance more affordable; -- remove regulatory barriers to the use of managed care for those who choose it. Traditionally, all Americans have had the freedom to choose their health care plans, as well as the providers who treat them. To ensure quality of care, it is imperative that patients continue to enjoy the freedoms to which they have become accustomed. Communications between providers and patients should be free and open, and allow for full discussion of the patient's medical care. Financial arrangements should not be a barrier to a patient's receiving quality medical care; -- permit families with incomes up to twice the poverty level to buy into Medicaid; -- promote rural health care through telecommuni-cations and emergency air transport; and -- increase funding for Community and Migrant Health Centers. Bill Clinton and most congressional Democrats opposed many of these reforms, especially Medical Savings Accounts and changes in malpractice laws. Congressional Republicans rallied the nation to win a long overdue victory for consumers and for commonsense. Three months away from the November elections, Bill Clinton caved in and promised to sign into law the Republican solution to America's health care problems. But the Clinton Democrats are still blocking Republican efforts to preserve, protect, and strengthen Medicare. Until Medicare is financially secure again, our job is not finished. More than 38 million people depend on Medicare, which is rushing toward bankruptcy even more quickly than predicted. Bill Clinton doesn't seem to mind. Despite repeated Republican efforts to work with his administration to save Medicare, his response has been a barrage of propaganda. We proposed Medisave; he indulged in Mediscare. We say this with solemn deliberation: Bill Clinton lied about the condition of Medicare and lied about our attempts to save it. We reaffirm our determination to protect Medicare. We will ensure a significant annual expansion in Medicare. That isn't ""cutting Medicare."" It's a projected average annual rate of growth of 7.1 percent a year - more than twice the rate of inflation - to ensure coverage for those who need it now and those who will need it in the future. We propose to allow unprecedented patient choice in Medicare, so that older Americans can select health care arrangements that work best for them, including provider-sponsored organizations offering quality care with strong consumer protections. Our commitment is to protect the most vulnerable of our people: children, the elderly, the disabled. That is why we are determined to restructure Medicaid, the federal-State program of health care for the poor. Rife with fraud, poorly administered, with no incentives for patient or provider savings, Medicaid has mushroomed into the nation's biggest welfare program. Its staggering rate of growth threatens to overwhelm State budgets, while thwarting congressional progress towards a federal balanced budget. Bill Clinton's response has been to ignore the problem - and attack Republicans for trying to solve it. We must find better ways to ensure quality health care for the poor. Medicaid should be turned over to State management with leeway for restructuring and reform. Low-income persons should have access to managed care programs and Medical Savings Accounts, just as other persons do, and State officials should have authority to weed out substandard providers and to eliminate excess costs. We endorse Republican legislation extending federal tort claim coverage to health care professionals who provide free medical services to persons who cannot afford them. Preventive care is key to both wellness and lower medical bills, and strong families are the most powerful form of preventive care. Responsible families mean less child abuse, lower infant mortality, fewer unvaccinated youngsters, fewer teen pregnancies, and less involvement with drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. To help low-income families toward those goals, we will unify scattered federal resources into block grants. We reaffirm our traditional support for generous funding of medical research, especially through the National Institutes of Health, and for continuing federal support for teaching hospitals and medical schools. We remain committed to, and place a high priority on, finding a cure for HIV disease. We support increased funding for research targeted at conditions that touch the families of most Americans, like Alzheimer's, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and diabetes. We call for an increased emphasis on prevention of diseases that threaten the lives of women. This requires dramatic expansion of outreach and education to expand public awareness. We call for fetal protection in biomedical research and will enforce the rights of human subjects in all federally funded studies. The value of medical research and preventive care to wellness and lower health care spending can be highlighted by the example of diabetes. Approximately 16 million people in the U.S. have diabetes, and 50 percent of people above age 65 are at risk for developing some form of the disease. Diabetes is a leading cause of adult blindness, kidney disease, heart disease, stroke and amputations, and reduces life expectancy by up to 30 percent. As much as 25 percent of Medicare expenditures are incurred in the treatment of diabetes-related complications. Scientific discoveries, made possible by federal funding of medical research, have led to new efforts to prevent diabetes, as well as new treatment strategies to forestall the development of its debilitating and life threatening complications. Today, people stricken with diabetes can, in concert with their health care providers, delay or prevent the serious and deadly complications of the disease. In other words, we now have the opportunity to reduce the burden of diabetes. Renewing Hope and Opportunity ""Thirty years ago, the 'Great Society' was liberalism's greatest hope, its greatest boast. Today, it stands as its greatest shame, a grand failure that has crushed the spirit, destroyed the families, and decimated the culture of those who have become enmeshed in its web."" Bob Dole, May 21, 1996, in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin Within a few weeks, Bill Clinton will sign into law a Republican reform of welfare. With a straight face, after twice vetoing similar legislation, he will attempt to take credit for what we have accomplished. So be it. Our cause is justice for both the taxpayers and for the poor. Our purpose in welfare reform is not to save money but to bring into the mainstream of American life those who now are on the margins of our society and our economy. We will, in the words of the Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich, replace the welfare state with an opportunity society for all. The Clinton administration's ""Reinventing Government"" program to reform the welfare state bureaucracy has failed. In fact, management reforms of the Reagan years were repealed and new labor-management councils that diluted efficient management were added as additional bureaucracy and red tape. We will revoke these Clinton administration policies and oppose the liberal philosophy that bureaucracy can reform welfare. The current welfare system has spent $5 trillion in the last thirty years and has been a catastrophic failure. Despite this massive effort, conditions in our nation's poor communities have grown measurably worse. Poverty used to be an economic problem; now it is a social pathology. The key to welfare reform is restoring personal responsibility and encouraging two-parent households. The path to that goal lies outside of official Washington. In the hands of State and local officials, and under the eye of local taxpayers, welfare can again become a hand up instead of a handout. All able-bodied adults must be required to work, either in private sector jobs or in community work projects. Illegal aliens must be ineligible for all but emergency benefits. And a firm time limit for receipt of welfare must be enforced. Because illegitimacy is the most serious cause of child poverty, we will encourage States to stop cash payments to unmarried teens and set a family cap on payments for additional children. When benefits of any kind are extended to teen mothers, they must be conditioned upon their attendance at school and their living at home with a parent, adult relative, or guardian. About half the children of today's teen welfare mothers were fathered in statutory rape. We echo Bob Dole's call to our nation's governors to toughen and enforce State laws in this regard, as well as those concerning enforcement of child support. Restoring common sense to welfare programs is only one side of the Republican equation for hope and opportunity. The other side is giving low-income households the tools with which they can build their own future. We propose to do this along the lines of the American Community Renewal Act, a Republican congressional initiative that would establish throughout the nation up to 100 renewal communities where residents, businesses, and investors would have unprecedented economic freedom and incentives to create prosperity. School choice for low-income families is an integral part of that initiative. We call for the removal of structural impediments which liberals throw in the path of poor people: over-regulation of start-up enterprises, excessive licensing requirements, needless restrictions on formation of schools and child-care centers catering to poor families, restrictions on providing public services in fields like transport and sanitation, and rigged franchises that close the opportunity door to all but a favored few. Not everyone can make it on their own. Government at various levels has a role - and some aid programs do work well - and so do private individuals and charitable and faith-based organizations, whose record of success far outshines that of any public welfare program. To promote personal involvement with anti-poverty efforts, we call for a Charity Tax Credit that will be consistent with the fundamental changes we propose in the nation's system of taxation. To ensure that religiously affiliated institutions can fulfill their helping mission, we endorse Republican legislation to stop discrimination against them in government programs. Older Americans Our commitment to older Americans runs throughout this platform. It strengthens our call for tax fairness, shows in our action agenda against violent crime, and motivates our crusade to preserve, protect, and strengthen Medicare. The Republican Party has always opposed the earnings limitation for Social Security benefits, a confiscatory tax that discourages older Americans from active engagement in all walks of life. While Bill Clinton imposed his new tax on Social Security benefits, he also initially vetoed our legislation to reform the earnings limitation, just as he vetoed our estate tax reform. The Social Security system remains the cornerstone of personal security for millions of the elderly. In 1983, a Republican president, working with the Republican Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee - Bob Dole - saved the Social Security system from fiscal disaster. We have a legal and moral responsibility to America's seniors and will continue to do everything in our power to ensure that government honors our commitment to Social Security beneficiaries, now and in the future. We will keep it financially sound and keep politics out of its administration. We will work to ensure the integrity and solvency of the Social Security trust funds. Those who are not older Americans now will one day be so. Our common goal is a secure economic future. To that end, public policy should encourage cooperative efforts by businesses and employees alike to expand the availability of savings vehicles for all. We want to expand retirement options so that individual choice, not government fiat, steers the decision-making process. We must increase both the amount and the portability of personal savings, especially in today's rapidly changing and unpredictable economy. We salute congressional Republicans for their landmark legislation simplifying pension law, cutting away the red tape that prevented many businesses from offering pension plans, and establishing a new pension system designed to meet the needs of workers in small businesses. We also salute Congressional Republicans for making long-term care more affordable and more available to those who need it. Too many seniors live in fear that they one day will incur long-term care costs that will wipe out their life savings and burden their children. The Republican Congress has passed legislation giving long-term care insurance policies the same tax-preferred treatment that health insurance policies now receive. Over the years, this legislation will give millions of Americans peace of mind and the financial wherewithal to obtain nursing home care of the highest quality. A CLEANER, SAFER, HEALTHIER AMERICA  ""Those of us who grew up in rural America grew up with a common set of values, a code of living that stays with us all our lives. Love of God and country and family. Commitment to honesty, decency and personal responsibility. Self-reliance tempered by a sense of community.... Those values made us the greatest country on earth. And the secret to getting our country back on track is simply to return to them as a matter of national policy."" Bob Dole, August 19, 1995, in Ames, Iowa We are the party of America's farmers, ranchers, foresters, and all who hold the earth in stewardship with the Creator. Republican leadership established the Land Grant College System under Abraham Lincoln, the National Park System under Ulysses Grant, the National Wildlife Refuge System under Teddy Roosevelt, and today's legal protections for clean air and water in more recent decades. We reaffirm our commitment to agricultural progress, environmental improvement, and the prudent development of our natural resources. Our goal is to continue the progress we have made to achieve a cleaner, safer, healthier environment for all Americans - and to pass on to our children and grandchildren a better environment than we have today. We must recognize the unique role our States, localities, and private sector have in improving our environment. The States and communities are the laboratories of environmental innovation. Inflexible requirements hurt the environment, add unnecessary costs, and reduce technology development. While we have made substantial environmental progress, we must reject failed approaches created by fearmongering and centralized control which will not serve our environment well in the century ahead. The Superfund program to clean up abandoned toxic waste sites is a classic case in point. More than half of the $30 billion already spent on Superfund has gone for litigation and administration. In other words, trial lawyers have profited from the current flawed and unfair liability scheme, while toxic waste sites wait to be cleaned up. Without the opposition of Bill Clinton, we will fix the broken Superfund law. We will direct resources to clean-up sites where there are real risks, and cooperate with citizens, States, and localities who want to help, rather than harassing them with unwarranted lawsuits. The States have been leaders in returning contaminated sites to productive use under ""brownfields"" programs. These programs tailor clean-up standards appropriate for expected future use, thus enabling environmental cleanup and economic development. Accordingly, as an essential component of our comprehensive Superfund reform, we will remove disincentives in current Federal law in order to allow States to expand their innovative ""brownfields"" programs. Inconsistent Federal policies have created a nightmare for our Nation's ports at a critical time of growth and change in international trade. We must protect the environment while recognizing the unique situation of each port. There must be a coordination of State, local, and Federal roles in encouraging our ports to expand to meet current and future needs. Republicans trust Americans to honor their shared desire to live and raise their children in a clean and healthy environment. For all environmental problems, we propose a common sense approach based on flexibility and consensus, that builds a better future on free enterprise, local control, sound science, and technology development. This is our positive and proactive agenda: -- assure that the air and water are clean and safe for our children and future generations; -- assure that everyone has access to public outdoor recreation areas; and that historic and environmentally significant wilderness and wetlands areas will be protected without compromising our commitment to the rights of property owners; -- set reasonable standards for environmental improvement that incorporate flexibility, acknowledge geographic differences, and create incentives for development of new technologies; -- base all government environmental decisions on the best peer-reviewed scientific evidence, while encouraging advancements in research; -- achieve progress, as much as possible, through incentives rather than compulsion, and improve compliance by letting States and localities play a greater role in setting and maintaining standards. Many States have enacted environmental education and ""voluntary self-audit"" laws to encourage people to find and correct pollution; the Congress should remove disincentives for States to achieve these goals; and -- assure private property owners of due process to protect their rights, and make environmental decisions in concert with those whose homes, businesses, and communities are directly affected. Our commitment to an improved environment is best embodied in the recently enacted amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act. This Republican initiative will guarantee all Americans a safe and clean source of drinking water and will grant local communities the flexibility to avoid unnecessary requirements. The Clinton Democrats disagree with our principles. They have increased spending by creating new bureaucratic programs, creating new paperwork requirements, and funding pet projects of their special interest friends. However, the Clinton Administration has failed to reduce regulatory burdens on States, localities, and individuals. It has failed to create incentives for environmental improvements or use sound science and cooperation to achieve environmental goals. Today, they are planning to impose scientifically unsupported, massive new regulations on ozone and particulates. These rules will impose new requirements on cities, add unnecessary costs, and destroy jobs without adequate justification. Republicans support the ongoing efforts of the States and communities to ensure reliable and safe water supplies. As the Federal government moves away from its past role as a grant giver and direct lender in the development of water-related infrastructure, we will encourage the establishment of public-private partnerships to build and finance our nation's water infrastructure. We recognize the Great Lakes encompass one-fifth of the fresh water supply of the entire world and we oppose any diversion of Great Lakes water. Republicans have always advocated conserving our animal and plant resources, but we recognize the current Endangered Species Act is seriously flawed and, indeed, is often counterproductive because of its reliance on Federal command-and-control measures. The adherence of Clinton Democrats to these discredited ESA provisions has devastated the environment they pretend to protect by virtually encouraging landowners to remove habitat for marginal species to avoid government seizure of their property. We will improve the ESA by implementing an incentive based program in cooperation with State, local, and tribal governments and private individuals to recognize the critical relationship between a healthy environment and a healthy economy founded on private property rights and responsibilities. Securing Property Rights Republicans consider private property rights the cornerstone of environmental progress. That lesson has been confirmed in the tragic environmental record of Communist rule and of socialist regimes in the less developed world. By safeguarding those rights - by enforcing the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment and by providing compensation - we not only stand true to the Constitution but advance sound environmentalism as well. Republicans, led by Senator Dole, have spearheaded efforts in Congress to protect private property rights. Improving Public Lands The nation's public lands - half the territory in the West - must be administered both for today's multiple uses and for tomorrow's generations. We support multiple use conducted in an environmentally and economically sustainable manner. We will preserve priority wilderness and wetlands - real wetlands of environmental significance, not the damp grounds of a bureaucrat's imagination. We support a thorough review of the lands owned by the federal government with a goal of transferring lands that can best be managed by State, county, or municipal governments. This review should ensure that the federal government retains ownership to unique property worthy of national oversight. Properties transferred from federal control must recognize existing property and mineral rights, including water, mining claims, grazing permits, rights of access, hunting, fishing, and contracts. We recognize the historic use of public lands for livestock production in compliance with legal requirements. Our renewable rangeland should continue to be available under conditions that ensure both expanded production of livestock and protection of the rangeland environment. We condemn the Clinton Administration's range war against this pillar of the western economy. We recognize the need to keep our National Park System healthy and accessible to all. Our National Parks have a backlog of more than four billion dollars in maintenance and infrastructure repair projects. The nation's natural crown jewels are losing some of their luster, tarnished by neglect and indifference. Our park system needs to be rebuilt, restructured, and reinvigorated to ensure that all Americans can enjoy and be proud of their parks. We stand for sustainable forestry to stabilize and provide continuity for our timber industry and to improve the health of the country's public forests. This requires active management practices, such as the responsible salvage harvesting of dead and diseased trees. The Democrats' hands-off approach has made our great forests vulnerable to ravaging fires, insects, and disease. The Democrats' policies have devastated the economy of timber-dependent communities across the Pacific Northwest and in the Tongass National Forest, the Nation's largest and most productive, to please elite special interests. We join families and communities in rural America who rely on public forests for their livelihood in calling for the federal government to carefully evaluate the socioeconomic impacts of its actions and to live up to its commitments to provide an adequate timber supply to dependent communities through sustainable forest management. We reaffirm the traditional deference by the federal government to the States in the allocation and appropriation of water. We deplore the Clinton Administration's disregard for State primacy through attempts to preempt State law with respect to water usage and watershed protection. We also recognize the need to protect adequate supplies of water for agriculture without unreasonable government mandates. We support the original intent of the Mining Law of 1872: to provide the certainty and land tenure necessary for miners to risk tremendous capital investment on federal lands, thus preserving jobs - indeed, whole industries - and bolstering our domestic economy. We support appropriate changes to the law to ensure the taxpayer will receive a reasonable return for the value of extracted minerals. We oppose extremist attempts to shut down American mining in favor of our international competitors. Power for Progress Our goal is an energy supply available to all - competitively priced, secure, and clean - produced by healthy industries operating in an environmentally responsible manner using domestically available resources to the greatest extent practicable. No one should take that for granted. Today's energy boom was hard won by Republican reforms in the 1980s, ending more than three decades of ruinous Federal meddling that drove up prices and drove down supplies. Now that progress is under attack from the same quarters that brought us energy crises, gas rationing, and dangerous dependence on unreliable supplies of foreign oil. That dependency is 50 percent today, and will be two-thirds in only a few short years. It does not have to be this way. The Clinton Administration has learned nothing from the collapse of liberalism. It clings to outdated regulation that stifles production and drives up consumer prices. Clinton proposed a punishing BTU energy tax that would have penalized consumers and cost thousands of jobs. After Republicans derailed that bad idea, Bill Clinton championed - and congressional Democrats approved - a 4.7-cent per gallon gas tax hike, not to improve roads and bridges, but for general spending. Now the Clinton Administration demands lighter cars and family trucks to meet its Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) goals, at the cost of thousands of lives lost every year in auto accidents - not to mention the cost in jobs lost to foreign auto makers. Nowhere has the failure of presidential leadership been more apparent than in Clinton's position on finding a reasonable long-term solution to our Nation's nuclear waste disposal problem. We support the federal government's obligation under contract to take possession of nuclear waste and remove it from temporary storage in over 30 states across the country. At the same time, we believe that the siting and licensing of both permanent and interim storage facilities should be based on sound science and not solely upon political expediency. The Clinton approach hobbles the nation's progress. Our program of energy renewal, on the other hand, is an essential component of broader opportunity for all. We must finish the job of preparing America's energy capacity to meet the challenges of the 21st Century. Today, Republican Governors and the States are leading the way to true and meaningful electric utility industry deregulation and competition and lower rates for all consumers. Restructuring the electric utility industry presents both great opportunities and challenges for our Nation. We support greater competition as we move toward a market-based approach, with true and meaningful deregulation, after an appropriate and fair transition period that allows for competitive retail markets while ensuring reliability of service in a cost-effective manner for all consumers. We support elimination of the Department of Energy to emphasize the need for greater privatization and to reduce the size of the federal government. The Department of Energy's defense concerns should be transferred to an independent agency under the Defense Department. Other necessary programs should be farmed out to other departments and offices. We support environmentally responsible energy extraction from public and private lands. We will not tolerate poor reclamation or pollution from mining or drilling. We advocate environmentally sound oil production in the largest known onshore or offshore petroleum reserve in the Nation - the small coastal plain portion of the 19-million acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Oil produced there, traveling through an existing pipeline, will bring billions of dollars in revenues to reduce the federal budget deficit. On the other hand, without ANWR coastal plain development, we will lose hundreds of thousands of potential jobs and untold billions of American dollars will be paid to foreign governments for the oil not produced from our home reserves. We continue to support and encourage the development of our domestic natural gas industry. Natural gas is a clean, abundant, and domestically available resource, which can be provided, transported, and consumed in an environmentally responsible manner. We will delegate management and collection of federal oil and gas royalties to the States, thereby increasing receipts both to the States and to the federal Treasury. This action will reduce bureaucratic involvement and administrative costs to the federal government. We urge the federal government to expedite and streamline the exploration, leasing, and permitting process for the domestic oil and gas industry. The coal industry now supplies more than half of all electric generation and is vital for our entire economy. We encourage research for cleaner coal combustion technologies and will require that objective, peer-reviewed science be the basis for environmental decisions that increase costs for electric rate payers. Because no single source of energy can reliably supply the needs of the American people, we believe in fostering alternative and renewable energy sources to assist in reducing dependence on unreliable foreign oil supplies. We anticipate the continuing development of energy from coal, oil, natural gas, agricultural products such as ethanol and biodiesel, nuclear, and hydro sources and where economically competitive, from wind, solar, and geothermal power. The United States should continue its commitment to addressing global climate change in a prudent and effective manner that does not punish the U.S. economy. Despite scientific uncertainty about the role of human activity in climate change, the Clinton Administration has leapfrogged over reasoned scientific inquiry and now favors misdirected measures, such as binding targets and timetables, imposed only on the United States and certain other developed countries, to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Republicans deplore the arbitrary and premature abandonment of the previous policy of voluntary reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. We further deplore ceding U.S. sovereignty on environmental issues to international bureaucrats and our foreign economic competitors. Energy policy and transportation policy go hand in hand. To prepare the National Highway System and the National Aviation System for the 21st Century, we will maintain the integrity of the Federal transportation trust funds and respect the call by Republican governors to ensure those funds are returned to the States with a minimum of federal red tape. Trusting the people, congressional Republicans passed the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995, returning to the States decisions about highway safety. We support reasonable speed limits, reflecting local needs and geography, and prudent personal safety measures, but we oppose Washington's one-size-fits-all approach to the mobility of the American people.  Agriculture in the 21st Century The moral strength abundant on America's farms and rural communities has been the foundation and source of strength for our Nation since its earliest days. America's settlers built their farming communities on values like faith, hard work, dedication, and self-sacrifice. Republicans see a very bright future for agriculture and rural America. Our program to strengthen rural America will benefit every sector of the economy and every part of the Nation. First and foremost, we will reduce the tax burden - both the estate tax and the capital gains levy - on those who produce America's food and fiber. This is essential to preserve production agriculture. Just like urban small businesses, rural producers need full deductibility of health insurance premiums and an overall tax structure that is simpler and fairer. Deficit spending by government is death by strangulation for agriculture. Our farms are major users of capital, with over $150 billion in current borrowing. Interest payments are one of their heaviest burdens. The Republican balanced budget of last year, vetoed by Bill Clinton, would have saved farmers more than $15 billion in interest costs by the year 2002. We stand with the American farmer in demanding an end to the spending excesses in official Washington. The elections of 1994 were a resounding victory for American agriculture. The first Republican majorities in both the House and Senate in 40 years won an historic breakthrough with the ""Freedom to Farm"" act. For the first time in six decades, Federal policy will allow individual farmers to grow what makes sense on their own land, not what a bureaucrat wants grown there. ""Freedom to Farm"" will permit them to respond to world trade opportunities for value-added exports that bring new jobs and broader prosperity to rural America. Moreover, the Republican ""Freedom to Farm"" act is the most pro-environment farm bill ever. By liberating high-tech, high-yield U.S. agriculture to pursue ever greater levels of efficiency, it will enable growers to produce more from less land, saving wildlife habitat and fragile soils from the plow. The new law allows farmers to rotate crops, thereby reducing use of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizer. It continues the Conservation and Wetland Reserve Programs and creates a new Environmental Quality Incentive Program to help farmers do what they do best - conserve the land and pass it on, enriched and enhanced, to future generations. While promising to modernize farm programs, the Clinton Administration instead advanced failed ""New Deal"" policies. Throughout the ensuing debate, they fought every effort by Congress to get the hand of government out of agriculture. Finally, having agreed to ""Freedom to Farm,"" Bill Clinton is threatening to repeal this historic legislation, undercutting long-term planning by farmers across the country. In contrast, ""Freedom to Farm"" ends the command-and-control policies that have choked the entrepreneurial spirit of rural America. ""Freedom to Farm"" permits experimentation with new crops and new markets, just in time to meet an explosion in worldwide demand for food, fiber, fuels and industrial products. We reaffirm our historical and continuing support for the expanded use of biodiesel and ethanol to improve the rural economy and reduce our dependence on imported oil. Experts predict the need for U.S. producers to triple their output over the next 40 years. ""Freedom to Farm"" positions them to meet the challenge of feeding a hungry and troubled world. While ""Freedom to Farm"" greatly reduced USDA paperwork imposed on farmers, much remains to be done to reduce the regulations that add about $6,000 per farm per year to the cost of farming. Our extensive program of regulatory reform is explained elsewhere in this platform. Republicans worked hard for and applaud the repeal of the Delaney Clause and the reform of food safety laws. These changes allow a responsible approach toward crop production and ensure the quality of the Nation's food supply, with special protections for our children. We reaffirm the Republican Party's historic commitment to agricultural progress through research and education, starting with the system of land grant colleges established in 1862. For the new century, as in the days of Lincoln, farming must look ahead to innovation and constant improvement, especially biotechnology and precision farming techniques.  RESTORING AMERICAN WORLD LEADERSHIP ""It's time to restore American leadership throughout the world. Our future security depends on American leadership that is respected, American leadership that is trusted, and when necessary, American leadership that is feared."" Bob Dole We are the party of peace through strength. Republicans put the interests of our country over those of other nations - and of the United Nations. We believe the safety and prosperity of the American home and workplace depend upon ensuring our national security in a dangerous world. This principle was proven in our long struggle against Communism, and - as recent events have tragically shown - it is still true today. The gains we made for democracy around the world under two Republican presidents are now imperiled by a rudderless foreign policy. We vigorously support restoring the promotion of democracy worldwide as a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy. Democracy is the best guarantor of peace and will ensure greater respect for fundamental human rights and the rule of law. The international situation - and our country's security against the purveyors of evil - has worsened over the last three and a half years. Today, Russia's democratic future is more uncertain than at any time since the hammer and sickle was torn from the Kremlin towers. With impunity, Fidel Castro has shot American citizens out of the skies over international waters. North Korea has won unprecedented concessions regarding its nuclear capability from the Clinton Administration. Much of Africa has dissolved in tragedy - Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi, Liberia. The Clinton Administration objected to lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia while it facilitated the flow of Iranian weapons to that country. Bill Clinton made tough campaign pledges on China but subsequently failed in his attempt to bluff the Chinese government - diminishing American prestige while not addressing the serious issues of human rights, regional stability, and nuclear proliferation. Bill Clinton's weakness, indecision, and double-talk, have undermined America's role as leader of the free world. In 1996, the nation's choice is clear: either we return responsible leadership to the White House , or Bill Clinton's lack of international purpose results in catastrophe. We must keep our country strong and sovereign, and assert the interests and values of the United States in the international arena.  The Atlantic Alliance and Europe ""Let us begin by reaffirming that Europe's security is indispensable to the security of the United States, and that American leadership is absolutely indispensable to the security of Europe."" - Bob Dole, June 25, 1996 The Atlantic Alliance: Our relations with the nations of Europe must continue to be based on the NATO alliance, which remains the worlds' strongest bulwark of freedom and international stability. Our policy will strive to consolidate our Cold War victory in Europe and to build a firm foundation for a new century of peace. In the same spirit that Ronald Reagan called for the integration of Spain into the NATO alliance, we call for the immediate expansion of the framework for peace to include those countries of Central Europe which demonstrate the strongest commitment to the democratic ideals NATO was created to protect. With the people of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary we have special bonds. These nations - and others - are rightfully part of the future of Europe. As Bob Dole said, ""It is an outrage that the patriots who threw off the chains of Soviet bondage have been told by Bill Clinton that they must wait to join the NATO alliance."" We strongly endorse Bob Dole's call for Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary to enter NATO by 1998. Bosnia: We support America's men and women in uniform who are serving in Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, we did not support the ill-conceived and inconsistent policies that led to their deployment. In 1992, candidate Bill Clinton pledged to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia, but once in office he ignored his promises. For three years, Bill Clinton upheld the illegal and unjust arms embargo on Bosnia and allowed genocidal aggression to go virtually unchallenged, while Bob Dole successfully led the effort in the Congress to lift the U.S. arms embargo. Once again, Bill Clinton subordinated American national interests to the United Nations in vetoing bipartisan legislation that would have lifted the U.S. arms embargo and rendered the deployment of American forces unnecessary. At the same time Bill Clinton was opposing congressional efforts to lift the arms embargo, he made a secret decision to allow the terrorist Iranian regime to supply arms to Bosnia. This duplicitous policy has endangered U.S. and Allied forces and given Iran a foothold in Europe. We look forward to a timely withdrawal of U.S. forces from Bosnia and recognize that providing the Bosnian Federation with adequate weapons and training is the only realistic exit strategy. We support the democratic process in Bosnia and, when conditions exist, the conduct of free and fair elections. We support bringing indicted war criminals to justice. We encourage the peoples of the region - and in particular those of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia and Montenegro - to play a constructive role in fostering peace and stability there. We note with concern that repression and human rights abuses are escalating in Kosova and support the appointment of a U.S. special envoy to help resolve the situation there. Russia: We salute the people of Russia in their quest for democracy and a free market economy. During this crucial period, the Clinton Administration has pursued an accommodationist and misguided policy toward Moscow. Bill Clinton's comparison of Russia's extreme brutality in Chechnya to the American Civil War is offensive. The Clinton Administration's passivity in the face of Russia's intimidation and economic blackmail against countries of the former Soviet Union has encouraged the rise of extreme nationalist and undemocratic forces. Its willingness to accept Russian changes to already agreed-to arms control treaties has undermined security. Its complacency over Russia's sale of nuclear technology to Iran and Cuba has contributed to the threat of nuclear proliferation. Our foreign policy toward Russia should put American interests first and consolidate our Cold War victory in Europe. We have a national interest in a security relationship with a democratic Russia. Specifically, we will encourage Russia to respect the sovereignty and independence of its neighbors; support a special security arrangement between Russia and NATO - but not Moscow's veto over NATO enlargement; support Russian entry to the G-7 after its reforms have been achieved; and link U.S. assistance to Russian adherence to international treaty obligations. Newly Independent States: We reaffirm our party's historic commitment to the independence of all former Captive Nations still recovering from the long night of Soviet Communism, especially Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Armenia, and Ukraine. We endorse Republican legislation to establish in Washington, D. C., funded by private contributions, an international memorial to the one hundred million victims of Communism. Ireland: We support efforts to establish peace with justice in Northern Ireland through a peace process inclusive of all parties who reject violence. During this difficult period in Irish history, we encourage private U. S. investment in the North, fully consistent with the MacBride principles for fair employment, in order to address the systemic discriminatory practices that still exist, especially against Catholics, in the workplace and elsewhere. We call on all parties to renounce terrorism in the Northern Ireland conflict. Cyprus: We encourage a peaceful settlement for Cyprus and respect by all parties for the wishes of the Cypriot people. Concerned about continuing tension in the Aegean Sea, we will maintain close ties to both Greece and Turkey and urge all parties to refrain from precipitous actions and assertions contrary to legally established territorial arrangements. Defending America Against Missile Attack We face two scandalous situations. First, most Americans do not realize our country has no defense against long-range missile attack. Second, the current occupant of the Oval Office refuses to tell them of that danger. So we will. This is the frightening truth: The United States provided the technology to Israel to protect it from Iraqi missile attacks during the Persian Gulf War, but President Clinton refuses to provide the technology - technology that is readily available - to the American people to protect our country from the growing threat posed by long-range ballistic missiles. The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) of the last two Republican administrations has been dismantled by Bill Clinton, who - contrary to the national security interests of the United States - clings to the obsolete Cold War ABM Treaty. Clinton slashed the funding budgeted by past presidents for missile defense and even violates the law by slowing down critical theater missile defenses. He has pursued negotiations to actually expand the outdated ABM Treaty, further tying America's hands, and hobbling our self defense. He now seeks new limitations that will hinder the United States from developing and deploying even theater ballistic missile defenses to protect our troops abroad. In a peaceful world, such limitations would be imprudent. In today's world, they are immoral. The danger of a missile attack with nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons is the most serious threat to our national security. Communist China has mocked our vulnerability by threatening to attack Los Angeles if we stand by our historic commitment to the Republic of China on Taiwan. We are vulnerable to blackmail - nuclear or otherwise - from a host of terrorist states that are now trying to acquire the instruments of doom. In the face of those dangers, Bill Clinton has ignored his responsibilities. In the most egregious instance, he directed that a National Intelligence Estimate focus only on the missile threat to the continental United States, deliberately ignoring the near-term menace posed to Alaska and Hawaii by long-range missiles now being developed or otherwise acquired by the Communists who rule North Korea. America will be increasingly threatened by long-range ballistic missiles in the near future, but there also exists today a more immediate threat from the proliferation of shorter-range, or ""theater"" missiles. Bill Clinton says that theater missile defense (TMD) is a top priority of his administration, yet refuses to provide adequate funding for our most promising and effective TMD programs. For example, not only has he recently cut funding by 40% for the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) program, but he has also failed to request sufficient funds to develop and deploy the Navy Upper Tier system. Republicans will fully fund and deploy these and other TMD systems to protect American troops and vital interests abroad. The Republican Party is committed to the protection of all Americans - including our two million citizens in Alaska and Hawaii - against missile attack. We are determined to deploy land-based and sea-based theater missile defenses as soon as possible, and a national system thereafter. We will not permit the mistakes of past diplomacy, based on the immoral concept of Mutual Assured Destruction, to imperil the safety of our nation, our Armed Forces abroad, and our allies. Arms control will be a means to enhance American national security, not an end in itself. We therefore endorse the Defend America Act of 1996, introduced by Senator Bob Dole which calls for a national missile defense system for all fifty States by the year 2003. To cope with the threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the United States will have to deter the threat or use of weapons of mass destruction by rogue states. This in turn will require the continuing maintenance and development of nuclear weapons and their periodic testing. The Clinton Administration's proposed Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) is inconsistent with American security interests. Rebuilding America's Strength Republicans are committed to ensuring the status of the United States as the world's preeminent military power. We must reverse the decline in what our nation spends for defense. In just three and a half years, an amateur approach to military matters and dramatic reductions in defense spending under the Clinton Administration have had a serious negative impact on the readiness and capabilities of our armed forces. In 1994, three of the Army's primary combat divisions reported unacceptably low levels of readiness, and all forward-deployed Army divisions reported below par readiness ratings. Not since the ""Hollow Army"" days of Jimmy Carter have Army readiness levels been so low. Funding shortfalls and shortages of spare parts and munitions are limiting training opportunities and thus the combat readiness of our forces. At the same time, Bill Clinton's peacekeeping operations and other global ventures have increased the operational demands on the limited forces available, extended the duration of their deployments, and put immense strains on service members and their families - without any discernible benefit to U.S. national security. Republicans faced a similar situation with a deteriorating military in 1981, but then two Republican presidents turned things around and restored America's world leadership. We must do it again, and quickly. The All-Volunteer force is composed of the finest military personnel in the world today. These outstanding men and women deserve a civilian leadership committed to providing them with the resources, technology, and equipment they need to safely and successfully perform their missions. They deserve nothing but the best from the people they protect. We recognize that today's military research and development, as well as procurement, is tomorrow's readiness. We are committed to readiness not just today, but also tomorrow. Bill Clinton has decimated our research and development effort, and slashed procurement for our armed forces. Not since 1950 have we spent so little on new weapons for our military. Fortunately, the Republican Congress has restored some of the funding Bill Clinton sought to cut for research and development and for procurement. Only a Commander-in-Chief who fully understands and respects the military can rebuild America's defense capabilities. The Clinton Administration's own inadequate defense ""strategy"" has been underfunded. The mismatch between strategy, forces, and resources poses an enormous potential risk to America's military personnel and vital interests. This mismatch must be resolved now, before regional crises erupt and find our nation unprepared. A Republican president will immediately conduct a thorough review that will require resources and programs to be redirected according to goals set by the President instead by the bureaucracy. Money alone is not the answer. It must be spent the right way, with long-term efficiencies in mind. We call for reductions in the overhead and infrastructure of the Defense Department and successful demonstrations of weapons and equipment prior to full scale purchases. Budgetary decisions must be made with an eye to preserving the nation's defense industrial base, accelerating procurement of key military and dual-use technologies, incorporating emerging technologies into military operations, and maintaining an adequate, safe and reliable capability in nuclear weapons. Only a Republican president and a Republican Congress can fulfill these duties. Protecting American Interests We scorn the Clintonite view that soon ""nationhood as we know it will be obsolete; all states will recognize a single global authority."" This is nonsense, but it explains why the Democrat Administration has lurched from one foreign policy fiasco to the next - and why Bill Clinton vetoed the first legislative restructuring of America's diplomatic institutions in a half century. A Republican president will reform the Department of State to ensure that America's interests always come first. Republicans will not subordinate United States sovereignty to any international authority. We oppose the commitment of American troops to U.N. ""peacekeeping"" operations under foreign commanders and will never compel American servicemen to wear foreign uniforms or insignia. We will insist on an end to waste, mismanagement, and fraud at the United Nations. We will ensure American interests are pursued and defended at the United Nations, will not tolerate any international taxation by the organization, nor will we permit any international court to seize, try, or punish American citizens. Before his departure from the Senate, Bob Dole introduced legislation prohibiting U.S. payments to the United Nations and any of its agencies if they attempt to implement global taxes. We support the passage of the Prohibition on United Nations Taxation Act of 1996 to preserve America's sovereignty and the American taxpayer's right to taxation with representation. A Republican president will withdraw from Senate consideration any pending international conventions or treaties that erode the constitutional foundations of our Republic and will neither negotiate nor submit such agreements in the future. We will ensure that our future relations with international organizations not infringe upon either the sovereignty of the United States or the earnings of the American taxpayer. American citizens must retain ownership of their private property, and must maintain full control of our national and state parks, without international interference. International Terrorism Terrorist states have made a comeback during Bill Clinton's Administration. He has treated their rulers with undue respect and failed to curb their acquisition of weapons of mass destruction. Although congressional Republicans passed anti-terrorism legislation earlier this year, the Clinton Administration has not implemented many key provisions of the law. It has not been used to freeze terrorists' assets, deny terrorists' visas, cut off foreign aid to supporters of terrorist states, or halt terrorist fundraising in the United States. The Clinton Administration has not implemented the anti terrorist research program established and funded by Congress in the 1990 Aviation Security Act. A Republican president will forcefully lead the world community to isolate and punish state sponsors of terrorism. It is vital to our security that we actively work to reverse the threat posed by these regimes - through imposition and enforcement of sanctions, banning investment, and leading our allies in effective policies. The governments of North Korea, Iran, Syria, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, and Cuba must know that America's first line of defense is not our shoreline, but their own borders. We will be proactive, not reactive, to strike the hand of terrorism before it can be raised against Americans. We denounce terrorist attacks made on American citizens at home or abroad. We must take all legitimate steps to swiftly apprehend and severely punish persons committing terrorists acts. However, we must also denounce any attempts to deprive law-abiding citizens of their God-given, constitutionally-protected rights while fighting terrorism. To take away the liberty of the American people while fighting terrorism is repugnant to the history and character of our nation. We firmly oppose any legislation that would infringe upon the rights of American citizens to freedom of religion, speech, press, and assembly; the right to keep and bear arms; and the right to judicial due process. Africa We support those U. S. aid programs to Africa which have proven records of success, especially the Child Survival Program of vitamins, immunizations, sanitation, and oral rehydration. We hail the social and economic progress of those nations which have used the free market to liberate the talent and striving of their people. They deserve our attention, but our outreach must be on a case by-case basis. Our hope for the future of South Africa, for example, stands in contrast with the military rule now imposed on Nigeria, the continent's most populous country. The Republican Party's commitment to freedom and human rights in Africa is as old as the establishment of the Republic of Liberia. Today, the tragic fate of that small nation symbolizes the larger tragedy that has befallen much of the continent. The Clinton Administration's dismal performance in Somalia, resulting in needless American deaths, set the stage for international passivity in the face of genocide in Rwanda and Burundi. The Clinton Administration has even failed to rally the world against the slave trade sponsored by the government of the Sudan, whose persecution of Sudanese Christians and others is nothing short of genocide. A Republican president will not tolerate this unconscionable treatment of children and women. Asia Bill Clinton's foreign policy failures loom large in Asia. Four years ago, most of that continent was rushing toward democratic reform. Today it threatens to slip backwards into conflict and repression. A Republican Administration will keep the mutual security treaties with Japan and with the Republic of Korea as the foundation of our role in the region. We will halt Bill Clinton's efforts to appease North Korea by rewarding treaty-breaking with American taxpayer-financed oil and nuclear reactors. We will make further improvement of relations with Vietnam and North Korea contingent upon their cooperation in achieving a full and complete accounting of our POW's and MIA's from those Asian conflicts. China and Taiwan: We support the aspiration of the Chinese people for both economic and political liberty, which includes respect for the human rights of the people of Tibet. Our relationship with the Chinese government will be based on vigilance with regard to its military potential, proliferation activities, and its attitude toward human rights, especially in Hong Kong. The Taiwan Relations Act must remain the basis for our relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan. We reaffirm our commitment to Taiwan's security and will regard any threat to alter its status by force as a threat to our own security interests. We will make available to Taiwan the material it needs for self-defense, particularly theater missile defense and coastal patrol submarines. In recognition of its growing importance in the global economy, we support a larger role for Taiwan in international organizations. Philippines: We reaffirm our historic friendship with the Philippine people, which has endured through changing circumstances. The Middle East Peace through strength continues to be central in the Middle East. Saddam Hussein reminded us just five years ago of the potential for aggression by radical states in this region. Republicans understand the importance of maintaining a robust U.S. military capability in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf, cooperating with our allies to ensure regional stability. Republicans also understand the need to be willing to use force to deter aggression and, where deterrence fails, to defeat it. That is why Republicans were the bedrock of support for the congressional vote to authorize the use of force against Iraq's aggression in 1991, while most Democrats voted against Operation Desert Storm. The Middle East remains a region vital to American security. Our enduring goals there are to promote freedom and stability, secure access to oil resources, and maintain the security of Israel, our one democratic ally in the region with whom we share moral bonds and common strategic interests. Most of the world's oil exports flow from the Middle East, and thus its strategic significance remains. But it is still the most volatile region in the world. Islamic radicalism, increasing terrorism, and rogue states like Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Libya threaten regional and international stability. In this environment, Israel's demonstrated strategic importance to the U.S. as our most reliable and capable ally in this part of the world is more critical than ever. That is why Israel's security is central to U.S. interests in the region. That is why Republican Administrations initiated efforts with Israel to pre-position military equipment, to conduct joint contingency planning and joint military exercises. That is why we advocate continuing cooperation on the Arrow Missile, boost phase intercept, and the Nautilus programs. That is why we look toward the greater integration of Israel into our regional defense planning and wish to explore ways to enhance our strategic cooperation. That is why we have continued to support full funding for aid to Israel despite cuts in the foreign assistance budget, and why we applaud the country's commitment toward economic self-sufficiency. We reaffirm that Republican commitment to maintain Israel's qualitative military advantage over any adversary or group of adversaries. While we fully support Israel's efforts to find peace and security with its neighbors, we will judge the peace process by the security it generates both for Israel and for the United States. In that context, we support Israel's right to make its own decisions regarding security and boundaries. We strongly oppose the Clinton Administration's attempts to interfere in Israel's democratic process. We applaud the Republican Congress for enacting legislation to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel. A Republican administration will ensure that the U.S. Embassy is moved to Jerusalem by May 1999. We honor the memory of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and express our support for the new government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. We applaud those leaders in the Arab world, President Mubarak and King Hussein, who have spoken courageously and acted boldly for the cause of peace. We endorse continued assistance and support for countries which have made peace with Israel - led by Egypt and later joined by Jordan. Republican leadership will support others who follow their example, while isolating terrorist states until they are fit to rejoin the community of nations. Western Hemisphere The U.S. commitment to democratic institutions and market economies in the Western Hemisphere has paralleled our enduring interest in the security of the region, as laid out in the Monroe Doctrine. The success of Republican national security policies in the 1980s halted Soviet imperialism and promoted the process of economic and political reform in Latin America - defeating totalitarianism of the right and of the left. During the last decade and a half, Latin American countries have made enormous progress developing democratic institutions. We applaud their progress and offer our assistance to further expand and deepen democratic conditions in the region. Hemispheric progress toward free and democratic societies has stalled during the Clinton Administration. A government bought and paid for by drug traffickers holds power in Colombia. Mexico - with whom we share hundreds of miles of border - is increasingly tainted by narcotics related corruption at all levels of society. Similarly, there are signs of backsliding on democracy in Latin America, most notably in Paraguay, where a coup was narrowly averted earlier this year. We call for a new partnership among the democratic nations of the Western Hemisphere to protect our hard-won victories against dictatorial government. This new partnership must address the most recent and dangerous threat to the hemisphere - narcotics traffickers and their trade. The emergence of the Western Hemisphere as an area - apart from Cuba - which shares our ideals of economic and political liberty must also mean close cooperation with the United States on a range of security issues. The Clinton Administration's policy of denying most Latin American nations the opportunity to replace their obsolescent military equipment, raise the professional competence of their armed forces, and cooperate fully with the United States in joint military training and exercises will be reversed by a Republican Administration. We cherish our special relationship with the people of Mexico and Canada. In a spirit of mutual respect, we believe the forthright discussion of economic and social issues that may divide us is in the best interest of all three nations. Bill Clinton's outreach to Castro has only delayed the emergence of ""Cuba Libre,"" extending the duration of Communist tyranny. The Republican Party has not wavered and will not waver in its goal of a democratic Cuba. We affirm our policy of isolating the Castro regime, including full implementation of the Helms-Burton Act to penalize foreign firms which do business there. Bill Clinton's awkward and misguided intervention in Haiti has cost American taxpayers some $3 billion and risked the lives of American military personnel for a less than vital interest. We reject Clinton administration claims of ""success"" in its military intervention in Haiti. Human rights abuses by government forces go unpunished, promised economic reforms have not been made, and the democratic process is deeply flawed. Security and Foreign Assistance America is and must remain the leader of the world. We did not win the Cold War without allies and friends, and we hope to face future challenges with them. Our country should not bear world burdens alone. Providing friendly nations with access to U.S. defense equipment can protect American security interests abroad and reduce the likelihood that American forces will have to be directly engaged in military conflict. The Clinton Administration has been blind to that wisdom. We have seen the result in Bosnia, where American ground forces have been deployed because the Clinton Administration denied Bosnia the opportunity to acquire defense equipment in the United States. The Clinton administration has diverted aid from our friends to support U.N. operations and social welfare spending in the Third World. Congressional Republicans have done all they could to resist this folly. Only a Republican president can put an end to it. The Clinton administration's failure to couple American interests abroad with foreign aid has produced wasteful spending and has presented an impediment to achieving a balanced budget. A Republican administration will ensure foreign aid is cost-effective and based on its important role in directly promoting American national interests. Protecting America's Technological Edge American scientific and industrial leadership is one of the critical factors sustaining American security. Our technological edge is at risk not only because of the Clinton Administration's refusal to sustain an adequate investment in defense modernization, but also its virtual abandonment of national security-related export controls. Acquisition of technology by aspiring proliferators of weapons of mass destruction has been irresponsibly facilitated. A Republican Administration will protect the American technological edge. It will do so by expanding investment in defense modernization, ensuring that the Defense Department has a key role in approving exports of militarily critical technology, and restoring the effectiveness of export control regimes. The Men and Women of Defense As Commander-in-Chief, Bill Clinton has been out of touch with the needs of the troops under his command. Bob Dole has served in the military and will protect military families against inflation, restore appropriate funding levels for billets and family housing, and ensure an environment where promotions and awards are made on the basis of military merit. A Republican president who has been on active duty will not casually disrupt military family life by sending troops on non-military missions around the world. We have a solemn obligation to those who fight for America. Our military personnel should not be denied a cost of living increase, as Bill Clinton proposed in his first year in office. A Republican president will ensure a high priority for the quality of life of our military personnel and their families. We will maintain the All-Volunteer force and will resist attempts to bring back the draft, whether directly or through Democrat schemes for compulsory national service. We will maintain our Armed Forces as a meritocracy, a model for the rest of our society, without special preferences or double standards for any group. We salute the men and women of the National Guard and Reserve, citizen soldiers who have been - and must continue to be - a tradition in America. They perform important military functions as an integral part of our warfighting capability, and provide a critical link between our national security efforts and every community in the country. Our National Guard and Reserve forces must not be treated as an afterthought. We oppose Bill Clinton's assault on the culture and traditions of the Armed Forces, especially his attempt to lift the ban on homosexuals in the military. We affirm that homosexuality is incompatible with military service. We support the advancement of women in the military. We reaffirm our support for the exemption of women from ground combat units and are concerned about the current policy of involuntarily assigning women to combat or near-combat units. A Republican president will continue to reevaluate and revise, as necessary, current policies in light of evidence with regard to the effect on military morale, discipline, and overall readiness. We will not tolerate sexual harassment or misconduct toward anyone in the uniform, but we oppose politically motivated witch-hunts that smear the innocent and destroy honorable careers. To promote the dignity of all members of the Armed Forces and their families, we endorse the efforts of congressional Republicans to halt the sale, in military facilities, of pornographic materials. We deplore Bill Clinton's shameless attempt to use protections afforded active duty military personnel under the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 to protect himself from a sexual harassment lawsuit. We will amend the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 to make clear that its protection against civil suits while on active duty does not extend to the occupant of the Oval Office. The Republican Party has always been the advocate of the nation's veterans and remains unequivocally committed to the faithful fulfillment of America's obligations to them. We have no greater duty than providing for the courageous men and women who have risked their lives in defense of our country, a major reason why we defeated Bill Clinton's plan to replace veterans' health care with socialized medicine. We will continue to meet the nation's promises to those who make the military their career. That is why Republicans proposed and created a separate Department of Veterans Affairs, support veterans' preference in federal employment education and retraining programs, and pledge sufficient funding for veterans' hospitals, medical care, and employment programs. Intelligence The intelligence community should be our first line of defense against terrorism, drug trafficking, nuclear proliferation, and foreign espionage. Bill Clinton's neglect of our country's intelligence service is one of his most serious sins of omission. He has underfunded, misutilized, and marginalized critical intelligence missions and capabilities. No wonder his first appointee as Director of Central Intelligence has endorsed Bob Dole. The nation's security - and the personal safety of our citizens - cannot be placed at risk. Effective intelligence can be expensive. But what it costs is measured in dollars rather than lives - an important lesson of the Gulf War. A Republican Administration will reverse the decline in funding for intelligence personnel and operations while better managing the development of futuristic capabilities. We will not constrain U.S. intelligence personnel with ""politically correct"" standards that impede their ability to collect and act on intelligence information. We will conduct whatever intelligence operations are necessary to safeguard American lives against the terrorists who bomb our airplanes and buildings. Space The Republican Party led America into space and remains committed to its exploration and mastery. We consider space travel and space science a national priority with virtually unlimited benefits, in areas ranging from medicine to micro-machinery, for those on earth. Development of space will give us a growing economic resource and a source of new scientific discoveries. We look toward our country's return to the moon and to completion of the International Space Station, not just as a unique orbiting laboratory but also a framework for world cooperation in pursuit of expanding human knowledge. Those and other ventures require leadership now lacking at the White House. The Democrat Party approaches space issues with a confined vision and misplaced appropriations, encouraging inefficient investments and pork barrel spending. Bill Clinton gives lip service to our space program but denies it crucial resources. A Republican president and a Republican Congress will work together to make space an American frontier again. We will develop the Reusable Launch Vehicle, promote markets for commercial space launch services, and push technology to its creative limits. Commercial space development holds the key to expanding our aerospace industry and strengthening our technology base, but it can be promoted only by removing unnecessary and artificial regulatory, legal, and tax barriers. Space exploration and exploitation are a matter of national security. Our Armed Forces already rely on space assets to support their operations on earth, and space technology will rapidly become more critical to successful military operations. Space is the ocean of tomorrow, and we cannot allow its domination by another power. We must ensure that America can work and prosper there, securely and without outside influence. A new Republican team will secure the high frontier for peace on earth and for unlimited human opportunity.  The Goal is Freedom America stands on the brink of a new century. After victory in the ""long twilight struggle"" against Soviet Communism, Americans can feel justifiably proud of the role they played in defeating history's most corrupt and predatory empire. The end of the Cold War has not spelled the end of history, but it has instead unleashed forces contained for nearly fifty years of superpower confrontation. Today America faces new challenges and new threats to our vital interests which can only be protected by our continued engagement in the world. Our nation must resist the temptation to turn inward and neglect the exercise of American leadership and our proper role in the world. Will the 21st Century confer new opportunities and new benefits on America, or will it prove to be an era of weakness and decline? This will depend on whether we have a strong, decisive leader like Bob Dole who will protect Americans at home and abroad and vigorously pursue the nation's interests around the globe. The U.S. Constitution, the finest document for human governance ever devised, establishes the mission of providing for the common defense as a chief purpose of the federal government, in order to secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity. The president's primary constitutional duty and most sacred responsibility is the role of Commander-in-Chief. Above all else, he must be able to ensure that the American people and our interests are defended. That requires strong, combat ready military forces and a sound foreign policy. If the President fails in this office, then America's freedom, independence, and prosperity will be jeopardized, and all other issues - domestic and economic - become moot. The bravery, skill, and sacrifice of America's fighting forces; the dedication, industry, and ingenuity of the American people; the superiority of U.S. technology; and the abundance of America's wealth and resources are sufficient to overcome any foreign threat or challenge. But these gifts are cause for gratitude and humility, not complacency. And these national treasures can be used to safeguard the nation effectively in a time of volatile change only if genuine leadership, wisdom, discernment, courage, and honor are present in the Commander-in-Chief and in the officials he or she appoints to critical national security posts. With such a president at the helm, America will know a new birth of freedom, security, and prosperity. And this nation, and the benefits it has bestowed upon mankind throughout our history, shall not perish from the earth. Conclusion As we begin a new era and a new millennium, we deem it essential to reaffirm the truths of the Declaration of Independence: That all men are created equal; That they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; That government derives its just powers only from the consent of the governed. We close this platform with the wisdom of our forefathers who had the courage to set their names to the Declaration of Independence as they too began a new era. Like them, we appeal to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions. With a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we pledge to each other and to the American people an unfaltering commitment to restore to America a deep respect for the values of human freedom.",177839,27775,"preamble we meet to nominate a candidate and pass a platform at a moment of measureless national opportunity. a new century beckons, and americans are more than equal to its challenges. but there is a problem. the clinton administration has proven unequal to the heritage of our past, the promise of our times, and the character of the american people. they require more and demand better. with them, we raise our voices and raise our sights. we are the heirs of world leadership that was earned by bravery and sacrifice on half a thousand battlefields. we will soon nominate for the presidency a man who knew battle and so loves peace, a man who lives bravely and so walks humbly with his god and his fellow citizens. we walk with him now as he joins one more battle, every bit as crucial for our country's future as was the crusade in which he served. just when america should be leading the world, we have an administration squandering the international respect it did not earn and does not value. just when america should be demonstrating anew the dynamic power of economic freedom, we have an administration working against both history and public opinion to expand the reach and burden of government. just when americans are reasserting their deepest values, we have an administration locked into the counterculture battles of its youth. americans are right to say we are on the wrong track. our prestige in the world is declining. economic growth here at home is anemic. our society grows more violent and less decent. the only way the clinton administration can magnify its questionable accomplishments is to lower our expectations. those who lead the democrat party call america to smaller tasks and downsized dreams. that is not the calling of an american president. today's democrat leaders do not understand leadership. they reduce principles to tactics. they talk endlessly and confront nothing. they offer, not convictions, but alibis. they are paralyzed by indecision, weakened by scandal and guided only by the perpetuation of their own power. we asked for change. we worked for reform. we offered cooperation and consensus. now, the asking is over. the clinton administration cannot be reinvented, it must be replaced. republicans do not duplicate or fabricate or counterfeit a vision for the land we love. with our fellow citizens, we assert the present power of timeless truths. this is what we want for america: real prosperity that reaches beyond the stock market to every family, small business and worker. an economy expanding as fast as american enterprise and creativity will carry it, free from unnecessary taxes, regulation and litigation. this is what we want for america: the restoration of self-government by breaking washington's monopoly on power. the american people want their country back. we will help them to regain it. this too we want for america: moral clarity in our culture and ethical leadership in the white house. we offer america, not a harsh moralism, but our sincere conviction that the values we hold in our hearts determine the success of our lives and the shape of our society. it matters greatly that our leaders reflect and communicate those values, not undermine or mock them. the diversity of our nation is reflected in this platform. we ask for the support and participation of all who substantially share our agenda. in one way or another, every republican is a dissenter. at the same time, we are not morally indifferent. in this, as in many things, lincoln is our model. at a time of great crisis, he spoke both words of healing and words of conviction. we do likewise, not for the peace of a political party, but because we citizens are bound together in a great enterprise for our children's future. the platform that follows marshals these principles and sends them into action. we aim at nothing less than an economy of dynamic growth; a renewal of community, self-government and citizenship; and a national reaffirmation of the enduring principles on which america's greatness depends. we will count our victories, not in elections won or in economic numbers on a chart, but in the everyday achievements of the american dream: when a man or woman discovers the dignity and confidence of a job; when a child rejects drugs and embraces life; when an entrepreneur turns an idea into an industry; when a family once again feels the security of its savings and has control over the education of its children. none of the extraordinary things about our country are gifts of government. they are the accomplishments of free people in a free society. they are achievements, not entitlements - and are sweeter for that fact. they result when men and women live in obedience to their conscience, not to the state. all our efforts as republicans are guided by the fixed star of this single principle: that freedom always exceeds our highest expectations. this is the greatest task before the republican party: to raise the bar of american expectations. of the potential of our economy. of the order and civility of our culture. of what a president can be, and what the presidency must be again. there is a continuing revolution in the yellowed parchment and faded ink of the american creed...a revolution that will long outlive us. it can carry the weight of all our hopes. it can reward every dreamer. it is the reason that america's finest hour is never a memory and always a goal. with trust in god and in fidelity to generations past and generations to come, we respectfully submit this platform to the american people. principles of the republican platform introduction because americans are a diverse and tolerant people, they have differences of opinion on many issues. but as a people, we share a common dream and common goals: a strong america that protects its citizens and champions their democratic ideals throughout the world, an america with a vibrant and growing economy that improves the standard of living for all, an america with a smaller, more effective and less intrusive government that trusts its people to decide what is best for them, an america whose people feel safe and secure in their homes, on their streets, and in their communities, an america where our children receive the best education in the world and learn the values like decency and responsibility that made this country great, and an america with the compassion to care for those who cannot care for themselves. principles . because the american dream fulfills the promise of liberty, we believe it should be attainable by all through more and secure jobs, home ownership, personal security, and education that meets the challenges of the century ahead. . because a dynamic and growing economy is the best way to create more and better paying jobs, with greater security in the work place, we believe in lower taxes within a simpler tax system, in tandem with fair and open trade and a balanced federal budget. . because wasteful government spending and over-regulation, fueled by higher taxes, are the greatest obstacles to job creation and economic growth, we believe in a balanced budget amendment to the constitution and a common-sense approach to government rules and red tape. . because we recognize our obligation to foster hope and opportunity for those unable to care for themselves, we believe in welfare reform that eliminates waste, fraud and abuse; requires work from those who are capable; limits time on public assistance; discourages illegitimacy; and reduces the burden on the taxpayers. . because all americans have the right to be safe in their homes, on their streets, and in their communities, we believe in tough law enforcement, especially against juvenile crime and the drug traffic, with stiff penalties, no loopholes, and judges who respect the rights of law-abiding americans. . because institutions like the family are the backbone of a healthy society, we believe government must support the rights of the family; and recognizing within our own ranks different approaches toward our common goal, we reaffirm respect for the sanctity of human life. . because our children need and are entitled to the best education in the world, we believe in parental involvement and family choice in schooling, teacher authority and accountability, more control to local school boards, and emphasis upon the basics of learning in safe classrooms. . because older americans have built our past and direct us, in wisdom and experience, toward the future, we believe we must meet our nation's commitments to them by preserving and protecting medicare and social security. . because a good society rests on an ethical foundation, we believe families, communities, and religious institutions can best teach the american values of honesty, responsibility, hard work, compassion, and mutual respect. . because our country's greatest strength is its people, not its government, we believe today's government is too large and intrusive and does too many things the people could do better for themselves. . because we trust our fellow americans, rather than centralized government, we believe the people, acting through their state and local elected officials, should have control over programs like education and welfare - thereby pushing power away from official washington and returning it to the people in their communities and states. . because we view the careful development of our country's natural resources as stewardship of creation, we believe property rights must be honored in our efforts to restore, protect, and enhance the environment for the generations to come. . because we are all one america, we oppose discrimination. we believe in the equality of all people before the law and that individuals should be judged by their ability rather than their race, creed, or disability. . because this is a difficult and dangerous world, we believe that peace can be assured only through strength, that a strong national defense is necessary to protect america at home and secure its interests abroad, and that we must restore leadership and character to the presidency as the best way to restore america's leadership and credibility throughout the world. building a better america ""this is no time for diminished expectations. this is no time to sell america's potential short. this is a time to let go of the 20th century and embrace the 21st - to seize the promise of the new era by liberating the genius of the american people."" bob dole, september , in chicago, illinois improving the standard of living we are the party of america's earners, savers, and taxpayers - the people who work hard, take risks and build a better future for our families and our communities. our party believes that we can best improve the standard of living in america by empowering the american people to act in their own behalf by: -- cutting the near-record tax burden on americans; -- reducing government spending and its size, while balancing the budget. -- creating jobs; -- using the benefits of science, technology and innovations to improve both our lives and our competitiveness in the global economy; -- dramatically increasing the number of families who can own their own home; and -- unleashing the competitiveness and will to win of individual americans on the world trade scene with free but fair trade. that's not wishful thinking; it's what we, the american people, used to take for granted before the growth of big government began to shadow our days and smother our hopes. in the 1980s - when we cut taxes, restrained regulation, and reduced government spending as a share of the nation's economy - prosperity made a comeback. jobs were created, incomes rose and poverty fell for seven straight years. then the democrat-controlled congress forced the tax hikes of and jammed through bill clinton's tax bill of . since then, clintonomics has produced an economy that is squeezing the middle class between high taxes and low growth. the astounding fact is that we were growing % faster in , when bill clinton described the economy as the worst in five decades. we've managed to avoid a recession only because the republican congress put the brakes on bill clinton's rush to ruin by substantially reducing government spending over the last two years. but we cannot go on like this. for millions of families, the american dream is fading. our goal is to revive it, renew it, and extend it to all who reach for it. our formula for growth, opportunity, and a better family life is simple: trust the people, cut their taxes, scale back the size and scope of government, foster job creation, and get out of the way. we've done it before, we can do it again. tax relief for economic growth american families are suffering from the twin burdens of stagnant incomes and near-record taxes. this is the key cause of middle-class anxiety. it is why people feel they are working harder, but falling further behind; why they fear the current generation will not be as successful as the last generation; why they believe their children will be worse off; and why they feel so anxious about their own economic future. after averaging . percent growth annually during the expansion following the tax cut, family incomes have failed to grow at all under bill clinton. since , families have actually lost much of the ground they gained during the low-tax, high-growth 1980s. anemic economic growth under bill clinton is largely responsible for this lost ground. the current economic expansion has not only failed to compare to the growth seen in the decade preceding his administration, it is the slowest recovery in the last years. since , the economy has grown by only . percent per year, compared to . percent in the previous years and . percent between and . bill clinton has demonstrated that he fails to understand the role excessive tax burdens play on the economy and family incomes. in the first year of his administration, he pushed through the largest tax increase in history, raising taxes on families, senior citizens, and small businesses. confronted with republican attempts to cut family and business taxes, he vetoed the balanced budget act which included the $ per child tax credit as well as incentives to increase savings, economic growth and job creation. the clinton tax increase has produced the second-highest tax burden in american history. federal tax collections now consume more than one-fifth of our total economic output. federal, state, and local taxes take more than cents out of every dollar the american family earns. the federal tax burden alone is now approaching a record percent of family income. american families deserve better. they should be allowed to keep more of their hard-earned money so they can spend on their priorities, as opposed to sending ever-increasing amounts to washington to be spent on the priorities of federal bureaucrats. in response to this unprecedented burden confronting america, we support an across-the-board, -percent tax cut to marginal tax rates. fifteen percent represents the total increase in the federal tax burden since bill clinton took office, and we believe such a cut should be the first step towards reducing overall tax burdens while promoting the economic growth that will raise family incomes and our overall standard of living. another drag on family finances has been government's failure to maintain the personal and dependent exemption at historic levels. if the personal and dependent exemption that was $ in had kept pace with inflation, it would be $, rather than the current $,. that is why republicans have made the $-per-child family tax credit one of the primary features of our tax cut package. job creation and increasing family incomes depend on economic growth, and a precondition for economic growth is a healthy rate of saving and investment. nevertheless, bill clinton vetoed republican bills to provide these incentives, including expanded and more generous iras - and new spousal iras - which could be used for health care, education, and home-buying. as a result, today's personal savings rate is less than half what it was two decades ago. republicans support expansion of iras and the establishment of spousal iras to encourage savings and investment. bill clinton also vetoed provisions to reduce the capital gains tax rate. excessive taxes on investment cripple the american economy and kill american jobs by increasing the cost of capital, locking in resources, and stifling small business growth and entrepreneurial activity. largely because of these excessive taxes, american businesses face a competitive disadvantage with respect to our major trading partners, hurting their ability to export products abroad and create jobs. to remove impediments to job creation and economic growth, we support reducing the top tax rate on capital gains by percent. in , bill clinton raised taxes on millions of middle-class retirees by dramatically increasing the income tax on social security benefits. this targeted attack on the economic security of our elderly was unfair and misguided. republicans believe that this clinton initiative must be repealed. these proposals making the current tax code fairer and less burdensome should be viewed as an interim step towards comprehensive tax reform. the current tax code is ridiculously complex and unfair. it is also an unnecessary drag on the economy. at a time when business investment plans are greatly diminished and savings rates are unacceptably low, we must reform our tax system to remove existing artificial, government-induced bias against saving and investment. to that end, we firmly commit to a tax code for the 21st century that will raise revenue sufficient for a smaller, more effective and less wasteful government without increasing the national debt. that new tax system must be flatter, fairer, and simpler, with a minimum of exclusions from its coverage, and one set of rules applying to all. it must be simple enough to be understood by all and enforced by few, with a low-cost of compliance which replaces the current stack of endless forms with a calculation which can be performed on the back of a postcard. it must expand the economy and increase opportunity by rewarding initiative and hard work. it must foster job creation and end bias against saving. it must promote personal freedom and innovation. it must do all this in order to boost wages and raise living standards for all of america's working families. a simple, fair tax system that is pro-growth and pro-family will not need today's burdensome irs. that agency has become a nightmare for law-abiding taxpayers. it must be dramatically downsized - with resources going to more important efforts like drug enforcement - and made less intrusive. to protect the american people from those who would undo their forthcoming victory over big government, we support legislation requiring a super-majority vote in both houses of congress to raise taxes. we also support a government that keeps its word. retroactive taxation, like bill clinton's infamous tax hike, breaks that word. we pledge a legislative or constitutional remedy to prohibit its repetition. because of their vital role in fostering charity and patriotism, we oppose taxing religious and fraternal benefit societies. we will not tolerate attempts to impose taxes by federal judges. balancing the budget and reducing spending ""we didn't dig ourselves into a $ trillion debt because the american people are undertaxed. we got that $ trillion debt because government overspends."" ""the budget deficit is a 'stealth tax' that pushes up interest rates and costs the typical family $, on an average home mortgage, $, on an ordinary student loan, and $ on a car loan."" bob dole raising tax rates is the wrong way to balance the budget. it enables the clinton tax addicts to wastefully spend the public's money. republicans support a balanced budget amendment to the constitution, phased in over a short period and with appropriate safeguards for national emergencies. we passed it in the house of representatives, but bill clinton and his allies - especially the senate's somersault six, who switched their long-standing position on the issue - blocked it by a single vote. as president, bob dole will lead the fight for that amendment, and in the states, republicans will finish the fight for its speedy ratification. once and for all, we declare: -- the budget deficit and high taxes are two halves of the vise that is producing the clinton middle class squeeze; -- a balanced budget and lower taxes go hand in hand, not in separate directions; -- reducing the budget deficit by shrinking government produces a fiscal dividend in stronger growth and lower interest rates; -- ending that deficit will make possible a dramatic return of resources to the american people; -- tax relief is the only way to return the economy to the growth rates our country enjoyed from world war ii to the coming of bill clinton; and -- we will not mortgage our children's future by incurring deficits. a president should be commander-in-chief in the nation's budget battle as well as in military conflicts. bill clinton has been awol - absent without leadership. congressional republicans had to fight his senate allies for over a year just to give him a line-item veto for appropriation bills. instead of helping us strengthen the presidency in this way, he set an historic precedent: vetoing whole appropriation bills because they spent too little money! his vetoes essentially shut down much of the government. we make this promise: a republican president will veto money bills that spend too much, not too little, and will use the line-item veto to lead the charge against wasteful spending. a republican president will build on the achievements of our republican congress which has cut spending in excess of $ billion over the last two years. the clinton administration's tactic of using irresponsible monetary policy to hide the effects of their bad fiscal policies leads to: -- higher inflation; -- lower growth; -- fewer jobs; and -- scarcity of capital to fund small businesses. this is not only bad economics; it is a hidden tax against both income and savings. we pledge a non-political monetary policy to keep prices stable and maintain public confidence in the value of the dollar. creating jobs for americans our goal is to empower the american people by expanding employment and entrepreneurial opportunities. fundamentally, jobs are created in the private sector. small businesses are the engines of growth and job creation. they generate percent of new jobs and percent of our gross domestic product. the republican party is committed to the survival, the revival, and the resurgence of small business. in addition to our overall program of lower taxes, regulatory reform, and less spending, we will: -- allow small businesses to deduct the costs of their health insurance; -- restore the fair home-office deduction so important to start-up businesses; -- assure that no one who inherits a small business or farm has to sell it to pay inheritance taxes; -- make the irs stop its discrimination against independent contractors; -- enact both legal reform and product liability legislation to shield small businesses and protect jobs from the threat of unfair litigation; and -- transfer from the public sector services that can be provided by the private sector more efficiently and cost effectively. small business is a force for enormous progress, socially, politically, and economically. this is both an economic and a civil rights agenda. small businesses owned by women now employ more people than all the fortune companies combined. republican-created enterprise zones will offer dramatic opportunities to workers employed by small businesses, particularly minorities and the ""forgotten workers."" republicans support the creation of jobs in all areas of the country, from the inner city to rural america. we must create the workplace of the future so that it becomes a vehicle for personal liberation for those who seek a foothold on the opportunity ladder. we advocate increased access to capital for businesses to expand, export, and bring new products and technologies to market. we propose to consolidate federal training programs and to transfer their administration to the states and local governments. restraining the size and spending of government is only part of the job. we must transform official policies and attitudes toward productive americans. many of our labor laws and job training programs are out of date and out of touch with the needs of today's workers. both the davis bacon act and the service contract act, for example, have come to restrict opportunity, increase costs, and inhibit innovation. congressional republicans have already launched a fight against the union bosses' ban on flex time and comp-time in private industry. those innovations are especially important to families with children. government has no business forbidding america's workers to arrange their schedules to suit the needs of their own families. in the same spirit, we will enact the team act to empower employers and employees to act as a team, rather than as adversaries, to advance their common interests. (it is opposed only by those who profit from labor conflict, for whom bill clinton has vetoed the bill.) another way to replace conflict with concerted action is to transform osha from an adversarial agency into a pioneering advocate of safer productivity. we will mesh its activities with the work of councils formed under the team act to advance worker protection from the ground up. in contrast, the clinton administration has produced no regulatory reform, no tax relief, no product liability reform, and no legal reform. our vision is that everyone who seeks a job will have a job. we will break the ""job lock"" and bring employment opportunities to all americans. science, technology, and innovation in the 21st century our goal is to empower the american people by using the benefits of advanced science to improve their quality of life without undue restraint from government. our bottom line is more jobs, better jobs, and a higher standard of living for the families of america. as we prepare for the dawn of a new century, it is essential that our public policies keep pace with an evolving economy. increased productivity is essential to expand the economy and improve the standard of living of all americans. a recent report by the office of technology assessment attributes at least half of all economic growth in the united states to advances in technology. america is expanding its leadership role as a country that fosters innovation and technological advances, the essential ingredients of increased productivity. leading these efforts are the men and women - and high technology businesses - that foster creative solutions to world problems. we must create policies that enable these thoughtful leaders to continue to invest in research and development. u.s. research and development (r&d);investment has increased significantly over the past two decades and currently accounts for about . percent of the nation's gross domestic product. the private sector has been the main engine behind this growth, contributing over percent of the national r&d;investment. such investment has led to increased employment and high-quality jobs. businesses that invest heavily in r&d;tend to create more jobs, and to employ high-skilled workers in those new jobs at above average wage levels. research and development is our commitment to the future. it is our investment in the future. we must design tax and regulatory policies that encourage private sector research and experimentation, while lowering the cost of such investments. we believe the marketplace, not bureaucrats, can determine which technologies and entrepreneurs best meet the needs of the public. american companies must use the most advanced production technologies, telecommunications, and information management systems. technological advance means economic growth, higher productivity, and more security. we therefore support private sector funding of applied research, especially in emerging technologies, and improved education in science and engineering. american workers must have the knowledge and training to effectively utilize the capabilities of those new systems. federal science programs must emphasize basic research. the tax code must foster research and development. these policies will increase the pace of technological developments by de emphasizing the role of government and strengthening the role of the private sector. we will advance the innovative ideas and pioneering spirit that make possible the impossible. new discoveries to bolster america's international competitiveness are essential. the fruits of federally funded research led to the creation of the biotechnology industry through the bayh-dole act. this is an example of innovation and risk-taking, creating , biotechnology companies employing thousands of employees and selling billions of dollars of products to keep us first and foremost in the global marketplace. the communications revolution empowers individuals, enhances health care, opens up opportunity for rural areas, and strengthens families and institutions. a dole-led congress passed the telecommunications act of to promote the full and open competition and freedom of choice in the telecommunications marketplace. in contrast, the clinton-gore administration repeatedly defended big-government regulation. this micromanagement of the information age is an impediment to the development of america's information superhighway. we support the broadest access to telecommunications networks and services, based upon marketplace capabilities. the internet today is the most staggering example of how the information age can and will enhance the lives of americans everywhere. to further this explosion of new found freedoms and opportunities, privacy, through secured communications, has never been more important. bob dole and the republican party will promote policies that ensure that the u.s. remains the world leader in science, technology, and innovation. homeownership homeownership is central to the american dream. it is a commitment to a safe and stable community. it is not something government gives to the people, but rather something they can attain for themselves in a non-inflationary, growing economy. for most americans, our home is our primary asset. mortgage interest should remain deductible from the income tax. we applaud republican congressional efforts to pursue federal budget policies that will result in lower interest rates. lower interest rates will open up more housing opportunities for more americans than any program washington could devise. republicans support regulatory reform efforts that make buying a house easy, understandable, and affordable. we affirm our commitment to open housing, without quotas or controls, and we condemn the clinton administration's abuse of fair housing laws to harass citizens exercising their first amendment rights. in addition, we support transforming public housing into private housing, converting low-income families into proud homeowners. resident management of public housing is a first step toward that goal, which includes eliminating the department of housing and urban development (hud). hud's core functions will be turned over to the states. its civil rights component will be administered by the appropriate federal agency while enforcement will remain with the department of justice. with the housing sector representing such a significant segment of the nation's economy, housing policy is and should continue to be a priority. we believe in a federal role which supplements, not directs or competes with, states and localities. we believe in federal programs which augment, not displace, private sector capital and resources. the federal government should not impose prescriptive solutions on state and local governments. republicans believe that states and localities should have maximum flexibility to design programs which meet the individual needs of their communities. washington must abandon the ""one size fits all"" approach and concentrate on adding value to the efforts of states, localities, private and faith based organizations and individuals. republicans believe we can and will accomplish this without disrupting services to the elderly, disabled and families with children. promoting trade and international prosperity republicans believe that the united states, as the sole superpower in the world today, has a responsibility to lead - economically, militarily, diplomatically, and morally - so that we have a peaceful and prosperous world. republicans support free and fair trade. in the american century ahead, our country will lead in international trade. american workers will be the winners in any fair competition, and american technology will drive a prosperity revolution around the world. exports already fuel our economy; their continuing expansion is essential for full employment and long-term prosperity. that is possible only within the context of expanding trade, and we can do it better without a department of commerce. our country's merchandise trade deficit exploded to $ billion in and will likely set an all time record in , siphoning american wealth into the hands of foreigners. trade deficits with all our major trading partners were worse in than in . with china alone, the deficit more than doubled to $ billion in the last three and a half years. with japan, bill clinton announced a series of hollow agreements that have done little to improve market access. with russia, he approved a $ billion export-import bank loan to foster competition with the american aircraft industry. with canada, he tolerates discrimination against the united states beverage industry and focused on our lumber crisis too late to help closed logging mills. with mexico, he ignored injury to american agriculture from massive surges in imports. we should vigorously implement the north american free trade agreement, while carefully monitoring its progress, to guarantee that its promised benefits and protections are realized by all american workers and consumers. republicans are for vigorous enforcement of the trade agreements we already have on the books, unlike the clinton administration that uses united states trade policy as a bargaining chip and as a vehicle for pursuing a host of other social agenda items. republicans will enforce united states trade laws, including our antidumping laws, and will use the super investigations that give the president authority to challenge foreign barriers to our exports. and we will use the export enhancement program to boost american farm exports. to advance economic freedom, we insist that united states foreign aid, whether bilateral or through the world bank and international monetary fund, promote market reforms, limit regulation, and encourage free trade. republicans will stop subsidizing socialism in the less developed nations. republicans will not allow the world trade organization to undermine united states sovereignty and will support a world trade organization oversight commission. free market capitalism is the right model for economic development throughout the world. the soviet model of a state-controlled economy has been discredited, and neither stage of development nor geographic location can justify economic authoritarianism. human nature and aspirations are the same everywhere, and everywhere the family is the building block of economic and social progress. we therefore will protect the rights of families in international programs and will not fund organizations involved in abortion. the cost of turning our back on the global marketplace is the loss of opportunity and millions of jobs for united states citizens. changing washington from the ground up ""on november , , the american people sent a message to washington.... their message is my mandate: to rein in government and reconnect it to the values of the american people. that means making government a whole lot smaller, a lot less arrogant, and getting it out of matters best left to the states, cities, and families across america."" bob dole, march , in washington, d. c. we are the party of small, responsible and efficient government, joining our neighbors in cities and counties, rather than distant bureaucrats, to build a just society and caring communities. we therefore assert the power of the american people over government, rather than the other way around. our agenda for change, profound and permanent change in the way government behaves, is based on the tenth amendment to the constitution: the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. for more than half a century, that solemn compact has been scorned by liberal democrats and the judicial activism of the judges they have appointed. we will restore the force of the tenth amendment and, in the process, renew the trust and respect which hold together a free society. as its first initiative enacted into law, the new republican majority on capitol hill launched that effort early in by forbidding the imposition of new unfunded mandates upon state and local taxpayers. from now on, if official washington promises benefits, official washington must pay for them. we will apply that same principle to the ill-conceived motor-voter act, the democrats' costly invitation to ballot fraud. to permanently restore balance in the federal system, states must have the proper tools to act as a counterforce to the federal government. our country's founders attempted to carefully balance power between the two levels. the tenth amendment, as well as the ability of state legislatures to initiate constitutional amendments, and other constitutional tools given to states to protect their role in the system have now been either eroded away, given away, or rendered impossible to use. thus, states lack the tools necessary to do their job as a counterbalance to the national government. we call upon congress, governors, state legislators and local leaders to adopt structural reforms that will permanently restore balance in our federal system. in this information era of uncertainty and rapid change, it is government close to home, controlled by neighborhood and community leaders, that can best respond to the needs and values of all citizens. as a first step in reforming government, we support elimination of the departments of commerce, housing and urban development, education, and energy, and the elimination, defunding or privatization of agencies which are obsolete, redundant, of limited value, or too regional in focus. examples of agencies we seek to defund or to privatize are the national endowment for the arts, the national endowment for the humanities, the corporation for public broadcasting, and the legal services corporation. in addition, we support republican-sponsored legislation that would require the original sponsor of proposed federal legislation to cite specific constitutional authority for the measure. a citizens' congress even with these structural changes, a system of government is only as good as the women and men who serve within it. when the voters of elected republican majorities in both the house and senate for the first time in forty years, capitol hill had been an institution steeped in corruption and contemptuous of reform. congressional republicans changed things, from the ground up. they: -- applied all laws to congress, so that those who make the rules will have to live by them; -- slashed congressional spending and cut back the staff on capitol hill; -- ordered an unprecedented audit of the house of representatives, with devastating exposure of the democrats' four decades of mismanagement; -- streamlined legislative procedures by reducing the number of committees and subcommittees; -- imposed term limits for house committee chairs and leadership positions - something the democrats still refuse to do; -- abolished proxy voting in house committees, ending the scandal of absentee members casting phony votes; -- required any representative charged indicted of a felony offense to relinquish positions of authority within congress until cleared of wrongdoing; -- ended the democrats' secret sessions by opening to the press and the public all committee meetings; -- brought to a vote, in both the house and senate, a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on members of congress. it failed to secure the necessary two-thirds vote in the house, where percent of republicans voted for it and percent of democrats voted against it. every senate republican voted to allow a vote on term limits, but the democrats killed it by a filibuster. it will take expanded republican majorities in the 105th congress to send to the states a term limits constitutional amendment; and -- passed historic legislation banning gifts to members of congress and their staff. we will continue our fight against gerrymandered congressional districts designed to thwart majority rule. we will eliminate made-in-washington schemes to rig the election process under the guise of campaign reform. true reform is indeed needed: ending taxpayer subsidies for campaigns, strengthening party structures to guard against rogue operations, requiring full and immediate disclosure of all contributions, and cracking down on the indirect support, or ""soft money,"" by which special interest groups underwrite their favored candidates. cleaning up government in , bill clinton promised ""the most ethical administration in the history of the republic."" instead, the clinton administration has been rife with scandal. an unprecedented four independent counsels have been appointed since the clinton inauguration to investigate various allegations of wrongdoing by members of this administration. the clinton white house has abused executive power in both the white house travel office firings situation and in the fbi files matter. the fbi director said there have been ""egregious violations of privacy"" in the gathering of fbi files of officials who worked in the white house under republican administrations. we believe that misuse of law enforcement authorities for partisan political ends is no trivial matter. such abuses strike at the heart of the relationship between citizen and government and undermine the rule of law and confidence in our leaders. scandals in government are not limited to possible criminal violations. the public trust is violated when taxpayers money is treated as a slush fund for special interest groups who oppose urgently needed reforms. for example, the democrats have denied school vouchers for poor children in the nation's capital at the demand of special interest unions. they have blocked urgently needed legal reforms at the command of the trial lawyers, now the biggest source of revenue for the democrat party. they have rejected reforms to improve the workplace to please union bosses who committed $ million to aid the clinton reelection effort. it is time to restore honor and integrity to government. we propose to: -- revoke pension rights of public officials who have been convicted of crimes; -- strengthen citizen privacy laws and reform the fbi to guard against the politicization of law enforcement that we have seen by the clinton white house; -- refuse to allow special interest groups to block innovative solutions for the poor or to block workplace or legal reforms that would help all working americans; and -- recruit for public service, at all levels, men and women of integrity and high ethical standards. we will end welfare for lobbyists. every year, the federal government gives away billions of dollars in grants. much of that money goes to interest groups which engage in political activity and issue advocacy at the taxpayers' expense. this is an intolerable abuse of the public's money. a republican congress will enact legislation, currently blocked by bill clinton's congressional allies, to make groups choose between grants and lobbying. we will establish truth in testimony, requiring organizations which receive government funds and testify before congress to disclose those funds. our ""let america know"" legislation will force public disclosure of all taxpayer subsidies and lobbying by groups seeking grants. we will permit ""private attorney general"" lawsuits against federal grantees to ensure better enforcement of anti lobbying restrictions. a republican administration will impose accountability on grantees, to reveal what the public is getting for its money, and will end the process of automatic grant renewal. we will halt the funding of frivolous and politicized research grants. streamlining government republicans believe we can streamline government and make it more effective through competition and privatization. we applaud the republican congress and republican officials across the country for initiatives to expand the use of competition and privatization in government. it is greater competition - not unchallenged government bureaucracies - that will cut the cost of government, improve the delivery of services, and ensure wise investment in infrastructure. a dole administration will make competition a centerpiece of government, eliminating duplication and increasing efficiency. honest budgets and real numbers we have a moral responsibility not to leave our children a legacy of monstrous debt. spending $. trillion a year should be more than an accounting exercise. restraining government spending, discussed elsewhere in this platform, is part of the solution. reforming the entire budget process is the rest of it. our goal is clarity, simplicity, and accountability in the nation's budget. the keystone of that agenda is the enactment of a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget which a majority of congressional democrats have vigorously opposed. we do not take that step lightly; but then, a $ trillion debt is no laughing matter for tomorrow's taxpayers. we vow to offer that amendment again and again, until congress sends it to the states for ratification. in addition, we must eliminate all built-in biases toward spending. for example, the ""current service baseline"" builds in automatic budget increases for inflation and other factors and works like this: if the democrats want a $ billion program to grow to $ billion, they then count an increase to $. billion as a half-billion dollar cut - and the media dutifully reports it as such. this is a deceptive and reprehensible shell game that must be stopped. a republican president will fight wasteful spending with the line-item veto which was finally enacted by congressional republicans this year over bitter democrat opposition, years after president grant first proposed it. even more important, we will stop the runaway growth of entitlement spending - the programs which automatically grow without any action required by congress or the president. this spending has jumped -fold since and consumes more than half the federal budget. we will take entitlements off automatic pilot and make congress accountable for their funding. to end outdated and wasteful programs, we will make the government performance and results act an integral part of our budget process. regulatory reform regulatory reform is needed more than ever. bill clinton promised to ""reinvent government,"" but he returned to the old mindset of controls and red tape. to make matters worse, he vetoed a comprehensive regulatory reform bill crafted by republicans in the house and senate. that measure will become law when bob dole is president. we commend house speaker newt gingrich and congressional republicans in their innovative efforts to rescind, overturn and zero-out absurd bureaucratic red tape and rules through the process known as ""corrections day."" a republican administration will require periodic review of existing regulations to ensure they are effective and do away with obsolete and conflicting rules. we will encourage civil servants to find ways to reduce regulatory burdens on the public and will require federal agencies to disclose the costs of new regulations on individuals and small businesses. a new regulatory budget will reveal the total cost of regulations on the american people. we will target resources on the most serious risks to health, safety, and the environment, rather than on politically inspired causes, and will require peer-reviewed risk assessments based on sound science. we will require agencies to conduct cost-benefit analyses of their regulations and pursue alternatives to the outdated clinton command-and-control approach. these common-sense reforms will restore fairness and predictability to government rules and, even more important, will enable us to achieve equal or superior levels of protection for the public at lower cost. just as important, we recognize that all too often, in its ever-present zeal to expand into every aspect of our daily lives, the federal government intrudes into the private economy by establishing new services in direct competition with already existing private firms. we oppose the use of taxpayer funds to provide a competitive advantage for government agencies seeking to compete with private firms in the free market. restoring justice to the courts ""when i am president, only conservative judges need apply."" bob dole, may , , in aurora, colorado the american people have lost faith in their courts, and for good reason. some members of the federal judiciary threaten the safety, the values, and the freedom of law-abiding citizens. they make up laws and invent new rights as they go along, arrogating to themselves powers king george iii never dared to exercise. they free vicious criminals, pamper felons in prison, frivolously overturn state laws enacted by citizen referenda, and abdicate the responsibility of providing meaningful review of administrative decisions. the delicate balance of power between the respective branches of our national government and the governments of the states has been eroded. the notion of judicial review has in some cases come to resemble judicial supremacy, affecting all segments of public and private endeavor. make no mistake, the separation of powers doctrine, complete and unabridged, is the linchpin of a government of laws. a republican congress and president will restore true separation of powers and guarantee the american people a government of law. the federal judiciary, including the u.s. supreme court, has overstepped its authority under the constitution. it has usurped the right of citizen legislators and popularly elected executives to make law by declaring duly enacted laws to be ""unconstitutional"" through the misapplication of the principle of judicial review. any other role for the judiciary, especially when personal preferences masquerade as interpreting the law, is fundamentally at odds with our system of government in which the people and their representatives decide issues great and small. no systemic reform of the judiciary can substitute for the wise exercise of power of appointment vested in the president of the united states. a republican president will ensure that a process is established to select for the federal judiciary nominees who understand that their task is first and foremost to be faithful to the constitution and to the intent of those who framed it. in that process, the american bar association will no longer have the right to meddle in a way that distorts a nominee's credentials and advances the liberal agenda of litigious lawyers and their allies. justice is mocked by some of today's litigation practices, which hinder our country's competitiveness, and drain billions of dollars away from productive americans. while we fully support the role of the judiciary in vindicating the constitutional and statutory rights of individuals and organizations, we believe the proliferation of litigation hits the consumer with higher prices and cripples the practice of medicine. despite bipartisan congressional efforts to enact legal reforms, bill clinton vetoed such legislation at the behest of his financial friends: the trial lawyers. a republican president will sign that bill, and more. we encourage state governments to adopt reforms similar to those we propose to restore fairness to the federal system: -- strengthen judicial sanctions for lawsuits that are substantially without merit, thereby hitting unethical lawyers in their pocketbooks; -- apply the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations law (rico) as originally intended, to criminal proceedings, not civil litigation; -- award punitive damages on a fair and reasonable basis after clear proof of wrongdoing, with limits that discourage opportunistic litigation. since punitive damages are intended to punish egregious wrongdoing, a substantial portion of the amount awarded should go to a crime-victim compensation fund or similar program; -- restore limited liability to non-profit organizations - churches, civic and community groups, and the volunteers who sustain them - to provide protection against profit-seeking lawsuits and to encourage volunteerism; -- increase sanctions for abuses of the discovery process used to intimidate opponents and drive up the costs of litigation; -- reform medical malpractice to reduce health care costs and keep doctors practicing in critical areas like obstetrics; -- eliminate the use of ""junk science"" by opportunistic attorneys by requiring courts to verify that the science of those called as expert witnesses is reasonably acceptable within the scientific community, and forbid the practice of making their fees conditional upon a favorable verdict. this action will reduce the practice of so-called hired-gun ""experts"" who make up theories to fit the facts of the case in which they are testifying; -- eliminate joint and several liability in order to ensure that responsible parties pay their ""fair share"" in proportion to their degree of fault; and -- guard against non-meritorious lawsuits that are designed to have a chilling effect on first amendment rights. a federal products liability law goes hand in hand with legal reform. its absence not only penalizes consumers with higher costs and keeps needed products off the market, but also gives foreign nations a competitive edge over american workers. bill clinton doesn't mind that. he vetoed republican reforms that would have saved the public tens of billions of dollars. bill clinton even vetoed the securities litigation reform act, a republican initiative to protect shareholders against avaricious litigation. that obstructionism was too much for even the democrats in congress, many of whom joined in overriding his veto. a republican president will work with congress to restore justice to the nation's courts and fair play to the practice of law. the nation's capital the district of columbia should be an example for the rest of the country. instead, decades of domination by the democrat party has left the city bankrupt and dangerous. its residents - and all americans - deserve better than that. we reaffirm the constitutional status of the district of columbia as the seat of government of the united states and reject calls for statehood for the district. we call for structural reform of the city's government and its education system. for both efficiency and public safety, we will transfer water and sewer management in the district to the army corps of engineers or to a regional entity. we endorse proposals by the congressional republican leadership for dramatic reductions in federal taxes - and the city's own outrageous marginal tax rate - within the district. bill clinton opposes that idea. a republican president will make it part of a comprehensive agenda to transform the nation's capital into a renewal community, an enterprise zone leading the way for the rest of urban america to follow. americans in the territories we welcome greater participation in all aspects of the political process by americans residing in guam, the virgin islands, american samoa, the northern marianas, and puerto rico. no single approach can meet the needs of those diverse communities. we therefore emphasize respect for their wishes regarding their relationship to the rest of the union. we affirm their right to seek the full extension of the constitution, with all the rights and responsibilities it entails. we support the native american samoans' efforts to preserve their culture and land-tenure system, which fosters self-reliance and strong extended family values. we recognize that the people of guam have voted for a closer relationship with the united states of america, and we affirm our support of their right to mutually improve their political relationship through commonwealth. we support the right of the united states citizens of puerto rico to be admitted to the union as a fully sovereign state after they freely so determine. we endorse initiatives of the congressional republican leadership to provide for puerto rico's smooth transition to statehood if its citizens choose to alter their current status, or to set them on their own path to become an independent nation. individual rights and personal safety ""we are discovering as a nation that many of our deepest social problems are problems of character and belief. we will never solve those problems until the hearts of parents are turned toward their children; until respect is restored for life and property; until a commitment is renewed to love and serve our neighbor. the common good requires that goodness be common."" bob dole, may , in philadelphia upholding the rights of all this section of our platform deals with rights and responsibilities. but it deals also with something larger: the common good, our shared sense of what makes a society decent and noble. that takes us beyond government policies and programs to what we are as a people, and what we want to be. we are the party of the open door. as we approach the start of a new century, the republican party is more dedicated than ever to strengthening the social, cultural, and political ties that bind us together as a free people, the greatest force for good the world has ever seen. while our party remains steadfast in its commitment to advancing its historic principles and ideals, we also recognize that members of our party have deeply held and sometimes differing views. we view this diversity of views as a source of strength, not as a sign of weakness, and we welcome into our ranks all americans who may hold differing positions. we are committed to resolving our differences in a spirit of civility, hope, and mutual respect. americans do not want to be afraid of those they pass on the street, suspicious of strangers, fearful for their children. they do not want to have to fight a constant battle against brutality and degradation in what passes for entertainment. we oppose sexual harassment in the workplace, and must ensure that no one in america is forced to choose between a job and submitting to unwelcome advances. we also oppose indoctrination in the classroom. americans should not have to tolerate the decline of ethical standards and the collapse of behavioral norms. most important, they should not have to doubt the truthfulness of their elected leaders. reversing those trends won't be easy, but our homes and our children are worth the effort. government has a small, but vital, role. but most of the burden must be ours: as parents, as consumers, as citizens whose right of free speech empowers us to stand up for the weak and vulnerable - and speak out against the profiteers of violence and moral decay. that needs to be done, both in our house and in the white house. bill clinton can't - or won't - do it. so we will do it without him, and with new national leadership of character and conscience. we are the party of individual americans, whose rights we protect and defend as the foundation for opportunity and security for all. today, as at our founding in the day of lincoln, we insist no one's rights are negotiable. as we strive to forge a national consensus on the divisive issues of our time, we call on all republicans and all americans to reject the forces of hatred and bigotry. accordingly, we denounce all who practice or promote racism, anti-semitism, ethnic prejudice, and religious intolerance. we condemn attempts by the eeoc or any other arm of government to regulate or ban religious symbols from the work place, and we assert the right of religious leaders to speak out on public issues. we condemn the desecration of places of worship and are proud that congressional republicans led the fight against church arsons. we believe religious institutions and schools should not be taxed. when government funds privately operated social, welfare, or educational programs, it must not discriminate against religious institutions, whose record in providing services to those in need far exceeds that of the public sector. the sole source of equal opportunity for all is equality before the law. therefore, we oppose discrimination based on sex, race, age, creed, or national origin and will vigorously enforce anti discrimination statutes. we reject the distortion of those laws to cover sexual preference, and we endorse the defense of marriage act to prevent states from being forced to recognize same-sex unions. because we believe rights inhere in individuals, not in groups, we will attain our nation's goal of equal rights without quotas or other forms of preferential treatment. we scorn bill clinton's notion that any person should be denied a job, promotion, contract or a chance at higher education because of their race or gender. instead, we endorse the dole-canady equal opportunity act to end discrimination by the federal government. we likewise endorse this year's proposition , the california civil rights initiative, to restore to law the original meaning of civil rights. we renew our historic republican commitment to equal opportunity for women. in the early days of the suffragist movement, we pioneered the women's right to vote. we take pride in this year's remarkable array of republican women serving in and running for office and their role in leadership positions in our party, in congress, and in the states. two women serve in our house leadership - a record untouched by the democrats during their years in power. the full exercise of legal rights depends upon opportunity, and economic growth is the key to continuing progress for women in all fields of endeavor. public policy must respect and accommodate women whether they are full-time homemakers or pursue a career. under senator dole's sponsorship, the americans with disabilities act was enacted to ensure full participation by disabled citizens in our country's life. republicans emphasize community integration and inclusion of persons with disabilities, both by personal example and by practical enforcement of the individuals with disabilities education act, the air carriers access act, and other laws. we will safeguard the interests of disabled persons in medicare and medicaid, as well as in federal work force programs. under a republican renewal, the abilities of all will be needed in an expanding economy, which alone can carry forward the assistive technology that offers personal progress for everyone. we support full access to the polls, and the entire political process, by disabled citizens. we oppose the non-consensual withholding of health care or treatment because of handicap, age, or infirmity, just as we oppose euthanasia and assisted suicide, which, especially for the poor and those on the margins of society, threaten the sanctity of human life. the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. we support a human life amendment to the constitution and we endorse legislation to make clear that the fourteenth amendment's protections apply to unborn children. our purpose is to have legislative and judicial protection of that right against those who perform abortions. we oppose using public revenues for abortion and will not fund organizations which advocate it. we support the appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life. our goal is to ensure that women with problem pregnancies have the kind of support, material and otherwise, they need for themselves and for their babies, not to be punitive towards those for whose difficult situation we have only compassion. we oppose abortion, but our pro-life agenda does not include punitive action against women who have an abortion. we salute those who provide alternatives to abortion and offer adoption services. republicans in congress took the lead in expanding assistance both for the costs of adoption and for the continuing care of adoptive children with special needs. bill clinton vetoed our adoption tax credit the first time around - and opposed our efforts to remove racial barriers to adoption - before joining in this long overdue measure of support for adoptive families. worse than that, he vetoed the ban on partial-birth abortions, a procedure denounced by a committee of the american medical association and rightly branded as four-fifths infanticide. we applaud bob dole's commitment to revoke the clinton executive orders concerning abortion and to sign into law an end to partial-birth abortions. we reaffirm the promise of the fifth amendment: ""nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."" this takings clause protects the homes and livelihood of americans against the governmental greed and abuse of power that characterizes the clinton administration; we will strictly enforce it. we defend the constitutional right to keep and bear arms. we will promote training in the safe usage of firearms, especially in programs for women and the elderly. we strongly support bob dole's national instant check initiative, which will help keep all guns out of the hands of convicted felons. the point-of-purchase instant check has worked well in many states and now it is time to extend this system all across america. we applaud bob dole's commitment to have the national instant check system operational by the end of . in one of the strangest actions of his tenure, bill clinton abolished operation triggerlock, the republican initiative to jail any felon caught with a gun. we will restore that effort and will set by law minimum mandatory penalties for the use of guns in committing a crime: years for possession, years for brandishing, and for discharge. we affirm the right of individuals to participate in labor organizations and to bargain collectively, consistent with state laws. because that participation should always be voluntary. we support the right of states to enact right-to-work laws. we will restore the original scope of the hobbs act, barring union officials from extortion and violence. we will vigorously implement the supreme court's beck decision to ensure that workers are not compelled to subsidize political activity, like the $ million slush fund extorted this year from rank and file members by washington-based labor leaders. we will reverse bill clinton's unconscionable executive order that deprived workers of their right to know how their union dues are spent. a sensible immigration policy as a nation of immigrants, we welcome those who follow our laws and come to our land to seek a better life. new americans strengthen our economy, enrich our culture, and defend the nation in war and in peace. at the same time, we are determined to reform the system by which we welcome them to the american family. we must set immigration at manageable levels, balance the competing goals of uniting families of our citizens and admitting specially talented persons, and end asylum abuses through expedited exclusion of false claimants. bill clinton's immigration record does not match his rhetoric. while talking tough on illegal immigration, he has proposed a reduction in the number of border patrol agents authorized by the republicans in congress, has opposed the most successful border control program in decades (operation hold the line in texas), has opposed proposition in california which percent of californians supported, and has opposed republican efforts to ensure that non-citizens do not take advantage of expensive welfare programs. unlike bill clinton, we stand with the american people on immigration policy and will continue to reform and enforce our immigration laws to ensure that they reflect america's national interest. we also support efforts to secure our borders from the threat of illegal immigration. illegal immigration has reached crisis proportions, with more than four million illegal aliens now present in the united states. that number, growing by , each year, burdens taxpayers, strains public services, takes jobs, and increases crime. republicans in both the house and senate have passed bills that tighten border enforcement, speed up deportation of criminal aliens, toughen penalties for overstaying visas, and streamline the immigration and naturalization service. illegal aliens should not receive public benefits other than emergency aid, and those who become parents while illegally in the united states should not be qualified to claim benefits for their offspring. legal immigrants should depend for assistance on their sponsors, who are legally responsible for their financial well-being, not the american taxpayers. just as we require ""deadbeat dads"" to provide for the children they bring into the world, we should require ""deadbeat sponsors"" to provide for the immigrants they bring into the country. we support a constitutional amendment or constitutionally-valid legislation declaring that children born in the united states of parents who are not legally present in the united states or who are not long-term residents are not automatically citizens. we endorse the dole/coverdell proposal to make crimes of domestic violence, stalking, child abuse, child neglect and child abandonment committed by aliens residing in this country deportable offenses under our immigration laws. we call for harsh penalties against exploiters who smuggle illegal aliens and for those who profit from the production of false documents. republicans believe that by eliminating the magnet for illegal immigration, increasing border security, enforcing our immigration laws, and producing counterfeit-proof documents, we will finally put an end to the illegal immigration crisis. we oppose the creation of any national id card. from many, one america's ethnic diversity within a shared national culture is one of our country's greatest strengths. while we benefit from our differences, we must also strengthen the ties that bind us to one another. foremost among those is the flag. its deliberate desecration is not ""free speech,"" but an assault against our history and our hopes. we support a constitutional amendment that will restore to the people, through their elected representatives, their right to safeguard old glory. we condemn bill clinton's refusal, once again, to protect and preserve the most precious symbol of our republic. english, our common language, provides a shared foundation which has allowed people from every corner of the world to come together to build the american nation. the use of english is indispensable to all who wish to participate fully in our society and realize the american dream. as bob dole has said: ""for more than two centuries now, english has been a force for unity, indispensable to the process of transforming untold millions of immigrants from all parts of the globe into citizens of the most open and free society the world has ever seen."" for newcomers, learning the english language has always been the fastest route to the mainstream of american life. that should be the goal of bilingual education programs. we support the official recognition of english as the nation's common language. we advocate foreign language training in our schools and retention of heritage languages in homes and cultural institutions. foreign language fluency is also an essential component of america's competitiveness in the world market. we will strengthen native americans' self-determination by respecting tribal sovereignty, encouraging a pro-business and pro-development climate on reservations. we uphold the unique government-to-government relationship between the tribes and the united states, and we honor our nation's trust obligations to them. in fulfillment thereof, we will ensure that the resources, financial and otherwise, which the united states holds in trust are well-managed, audited, and protected. we second bob dole's call for legislation authorizing tribal governments to reorganize the bureau of indian affairs and the indian health service. we endorse efforts to ensure equitable participation in federal programs by native americans, native alaskans and native hawaiians and to preserve their culture and languages. getting tough on crime ""women in america know better than anyone about the randomness and ruthlessness of crime. it is a shameful, national disgrace that nightfall has become synonymous with fear for so many of america's women."" bob dole, may , in aurora, colorado during bill clinton's tenure, america has become a more fearful place, especially for the elderly and for women and children. violent crime has turned our homes into prisons, our streets and schoolyards into battlegrounds. it devours half a trillion dollars every year. unfortunately, far worse could be coming in the near future. while we acknowledge the extraordinary efforts of single parents, we recognize that a generation of fatherless boys raises the prospect of soaring juvenile crime. this is, in part the legacy of liberalism - in the old democrat congress, in the clinton department of justice, and in the courts, where judges appointed by democrat presidents continue their assault against the rights of law-abiding americans. for too long government policy has been controlled by criminals and their defense lawyers. democrat congresses cared more about rights of criminals than safety for americans. bill clinton arbitrarily closed off pennsylvania avenue, the nation's main street, for his protection, while his policies left the public unprotected against vicious criminals. as a symbol of our determination to restore the rule of law - in the white house as well as in our streets - we will reopen pennsylvania avenue. after the elections of , the new republican majorities in the house and senate fought back with legislation that ends frivolous, costly, and unnecessarily lengthy death-row appeals, requires criminals to pay restitution to their victims, speeds the removal of criminal aliens, and steps up the fight against terrorism. congressional republicans put into law a truth-in-sentencing prison grant program to provide incentives to states which enact laws requiring violent felons to serve at least % of their sentences and replaced a myriad of democrat ""washington knows best"" prevention programs with bloc grants to cities and counties to use to fight crime as they see fit. they put an end to federal court early-release orders for prison overcrowding and made it much harder for prisoners to file frivolous lawsuits about prison conditions. there's more to do, once bill clinton's veto threats no longer block the way. we will establish no frills prisons where prisoners are required to work productively and make the threat of jail a real deterrent to crime. prisons should not be places of rest and relaxation. we will reform the supreme court's fanciful exclusionary rule, which has allowed a generation of criminals to get off on technicalities. juvenile crime is one of the most difficult challenges facing our nation. the juvenile justice system is broken. it fails to punish the minor crimes that lead to larger offenses, and lacks early intervention to keep delinquency from turning into violent crime. truancy laws are not enforced, positive role models are lacking, and parental responsibility is overlooked. we will stress accountability at every step in the system and require adult trials for juveniles who commit adult crimes. in addition, not only is juvenile crime on the rise, but unsupervised juveniles (especially at night) are most often the victims of abuse in our society. recognizing that local jurisdictions have a clear and concise understanding of their problems, we encourage them to develop and enact innovative programs to address juvenile crime. we also encourage them to consider juvenile nocturnal curfews as an effective law enforcement tool in helping reduce juvenile crime and juvenile victimization. juvenile criminal proceedings should be open to victims and the public. juvenile conviction records should not be sealed but made available to law enforcement agencies, the courts, and those who hire for sensitive work in schools and day-care centers. because liberal jurists keep expanding the rights of the accused, republicans propose a constitutional amendment to protect victims' rights: audio and visual testimony of victims kept on file for future hearings, full restitution, protection from intimidation or violence by the offender, notification of court proceedings, a chance to be heard in plea bargains, the right to remain in court during trials and hearings concerning the crimes committed against them, a voice in the sentencing proceedings, notice of the release or escape of offenders. bill clinton hypocritically endorsed our victim's rights amendment while naming judges who opposed capital punishment, turned felons loose, and even excused murder as a form of social protest. bob dole, the next republican president will end that nonsense and make our courts once again an instrument of justice. while the federal government's role is essential, most law enforcement must remain in the hands of local communities, directed by state and local officials who are closely answerable to the people whose lives are affected by crime. in that regard, we support community policing; nothing inhibits local crime like an officer in the neighborhood. bill clinton promised , more police officers on the beat but, according to his own attorney general, delivered no more than ,. he ignored local law enforcers by tying the program in knots of red tape and high costs. now he is diverting millions of its dollars, appropriated by congressional republicans to fight street crime, to state parks and environmental projects. it's time to return those anti-crime resources to communities and let them decide what works best to keep their homes, schools, and workplaces safe. this would result in far more new police officers than bill clinton's program and give communities additional crime fighting resources they need. we will work with local authorities to prevent prison inmates from receiving disability or other government entitlements while incarcerated. we support efforts to allow peace officers, including qualified retirees, to assist their colleagues and protect their communities even when they are out of their home jurisdictions to the extent this is consistent with applicable state and local law. we will amend the fair labor standards act so that corrections officers can volunteer to assist local law enforcement. crimes against women and children demand an emphatic response. under bob dole and dick zimmer's leadership, republicans in congress pushed through megan's law - the requirement that local communities be notified when sex offenders and kidnappers are released - in response to the growing number of violent sexual assaults and murders like the brutal murder of a little girl in new jersey. we call for special penalties against thugs who assault or batter pregnant women and harm them or their unborn children. we endorse bob dole's call to bring federal penalties for child pornography in line with far tougher state penalties: ten years for a first offense, fifteen for the second, and life for a third. we believe it is time to revisit the supreme court's arbitrary decision of that protects even the most vicious rapists from the death penalty. bob dole authored a tough federal statute which provides for the admissibility of prior similar criminal acts of defendants in sexual assault cases. this important law enforcement tool should serve as a model for the states. we continue our strong support of capital punishment for those who commit heinous federal crimes; including the kingpins of the narcotics trade. we wish to express our support and sympathy for all victims of terrorism and their families. acts of terrorism against americans and american interests must be stopped and those who commit them must be brought to justice. we recommend a presidentially appointed ""blue ribbon"" commission to study more effective methods of prosecuting terrorists. only republican resolve can prepare our nation to deal with the four deadly threats facing us in the early years of the 21st century: violent crime, drugs, terrorism, and international organized crime. those perils are interlocked - and all are escalating. this is no time for excuses. it's time for a change. solving the drug crisis the verdict is in on bill clinton's moral leadership: after years of steady decline, the use of marijuana among teens doubled in the two years after . at the same time, the use of cocaine and methamphetamines dramatically increased. that shocks but should not surprise. for in the war on drugs - an essential component of the fight against crime - today's democratic party has been a conscientious objector. nowhere is the discrepancy between bill clinton's rhetoric and his actions more apparent. mr. clinton's personal record has been a betrayal of the nation's trust, sending the worst possible signal to the nation's youth. at the urging of the secret service, the white house had to institute a drug-testing program for clinton staffers who were known to be recent users of illegal narcotics. at the same time, he drastically cut funding for drug interdiction. the office of national drug control policy was cut by percent, and federal drug prosecutions dropped percent. his attorney general proposed to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug trafficking and related crimes, and his surgeon general advocated legalization of narcotics. hundreds of suspected drug smugglers have been allowed to go free at the border. simultaneously, the use of marijuana, cocaine, and heroin has increased, especially among young people. now narcotics are again fueling the acceleration of crime rates, putting the nation on a collision course with the future. bill clinton's weakness in international affairs has worsened the situation here at home. one case in point: he certified that mexico has cooperated with our drug interdiction effort when percent of drugs smuggled into the u. s. come across our southern border - and when the mexican government ignored extradition orders for drug criminals. discredited at home and abroad, he lacks both the stature and the credibility to lead us toward a drug-free america. a war against drugs requires moral leadership now lacking in the white house. throughout the 1980s, the republican approach - no legalization, no tolerance, no excuses - turned the tide against drug abuse. we can do it again by emphasizing prevention, interdiction, a tough international approach, and a crack-down on users. that requires reversing one of bill clinton's most offensive actions: his shocking purge of every u. s. attorney in the country shortly after he took office. this unprecedented firing destroyed our first line of defense against drug traffickers and other career criminals. our country's most experienced and dedicated prosecutors were replaced with clintonite liberals, some of whom have refused to prosecute major drug dealers, foreign narcotics smugglers, and child pornographers. in a dole administration, u. s. attorneys will prosecute and jail those who prey upon the innocent. we support upgrading our interdiction effort by establishing a deputy commissioner for drug enforcement within the customs service. we will intensify our intelligence efforts against international drug traffickers and use whatever means necessary to destroy their operations and seize their personal accounts. we support strong penalties, including mandatory minimum sentences, for drug trafficking, distribution and drug-related crimes. drug use is closely related to crime and recidivism. drug testing should be made a routine feature of the criminal justice process at every stage, including the juvenile justice system. test results should be used in deciding pretrial release, sentencing, and probation revocation. a safer america must include highways without drunk or drug-impaired drivers. we support the toughest possible state laws to deal with drivers impaired by substance abuse and advocate federal cooperation, not compulsion, toward that end. the bottom line: from the top down making america safe again will be a tremendous undertaking, in its own way as heroic as was the liberation of europe from a different kind of criminal half a century ago. at the grassroots, that crusade already has enlisted the men and women of local law enforcement. now they need a leader worthy of their cause - someone whose life reflects respect for the law, not evasion of it. bill clinton need not apply. bob dole will be a president committed to the protection and safety of all americans. however, his strength is diminished without a court system supportive of the national fight against violent crime. that is the bottom line of this year's presidential election: who should chart the course of law enforcement for the next generation by naming as many as an additional percent of our federal judges and the next several justices to the u. s. supreme court? bill clinton, the master of excuse and evasion? or bob dole, whose life has been an exercise in honor and duty? families and society ""the alternative to cold bureaucracy is not indifference. it is the warmth of families and neighborhoods, charities, churches, synagogues and communities. these value-shaping institutions have the tools to reclaim lives - individual responsibility, tough love, and spiritual renewal. they do more than care for the body; they restore the spirit."" bob dole, may , , in philadelphia stronger families we are the party of the american family, educating children, caring for the sick, learning from the elderly, and helping the less fortunate. we believe that strengthening family life is the best way to improve the quality of life for everyone. families foster the virtues that make a free society strong. we rely on the home and its supportive institutions to instill honesty, self-discipline, mutual respect and the other virtues that sustain democracy. our goal is to promote those values by respecting the rights of families and by assisting, where appropriate, the institutions which mediate between government and the home. while recognizing a role for government in dealing with social ills, we look to mediating institutions - religious and community groups, private associations of all kinds - to take the lead in tackling the social ills that some government programs have only worsened. this is the clearest distinction between republicans and clinton democrats: we believe the family is the core institution of our society. bill clinton thinks government should hold that place. it's little wonder, then, that today's families feel under siege. they seem to work harder with less reward for their labor. they can no longer expect that life will be better for their children than it was for them. their problem starts in the white house. bill clinton has hit families with higher taxes, vetoed their tax relief, and given their money to special interest groups. he has meddled in their schools, fought family choice in education, and promoted lifestyles inimical to their values. he repeatedly vetoed pro-family welfare reforms before surrendering to the demands of the american people. he tried to impose a ruinous government takeover of health care; led a scare campaign against republican efforts to preserve, protect, and strengthen medicare; and appointed to major positions in his administration social theorists whose bizarre views are alien to those of most americans. republicans want to get our society back on track - toward good schools with great teachers, welfare that really helps, and health care responsive to the needs of people, not government. we want to make sure our most important programs - like social security and medicare - are there when people need them. in all those cases, we start with the family as the building block of a safe and caring society. our agenda for more secure families runs throughout this platform. here we take special notice of the way congressional republicans have advanced adoption assistance, promoted foster care reform, and fought the marriage penalty in the tax code. they have worked to let parents have flex time and comp-time in private industry, and have safeguarded family choice in child care against the democrats' attempts to control it. they passed the defense of marriage act, which defines ""marriage"" for purposes of federal law as the legal union of one man and one woman and prevents federal judges and bureaucrats from forcing states to recognize other living arrangements as ""marriages."" further, they have advanced the family rights and privacy act - a bill of rights against the intrusions of big government and its grantees. in the house and senate, republicans have championed the economic rights of the family and made a $ per child tax credit the centerpiece of their reform agenda. but that overdue measure of relief for households with children was vetoed. we salute parents working at the state level to ensure constitutional protection for the rights of the family. we urge state legislators to review divorce laws to foster the stability of the home and protect the economic rights of the innocent spouse and children. improving education ""at the center of all that afflicts our schools is a denial of free choice. our public schools are in trouble because they are no longer run by the public. instead, they're controlled by narrow special interest groups who regard public education not as a public trust, but as political territory to be guarded at all costs."" bob dole, july , , in minneapolis the american people know that something is terribly wrong with our education system. the evidence is everywhere: children who cannot read, graduates who cannot reason, danger in schoolyards, indoctrination in classrooms. to this crisis in our schools, bill clinton responds with the same liberal dogmas that created the mess: more federal control and more spending on all the wrong things. he opposes family rights in education and opportunity scholarships for poor children. when it comes to saving our schools, he flunks. americans should have the best education in the world. we spend more per pupil than any other nation, and the great majority of our teachers are dedicated and skilled educators, whose interests are ignored by political union bosses. our goal is nothing less than a renaissance in american education, begun by returning its control to parents, teachers, local school boards and, through them, to communities and local taxpayers. our formula is as simple as it is sweeping: the federal government has no constitutional authority to be involved in school curricula or to control jobs in the work place. that is why we will abolish the department of education, end federal meddling in our schools, and promote family choice at all levels of learning. we therefore call for prompt repeal of the goals program and the school to-work act of , which put new federal controls, as well as unfunded mandates, on the states. we further urge that federal attempts to impose outcome- or performance-based education on local schools be ended. we know what works in education, and it isn't the liberal fads of the last thirty years. it's discipline, parental involvement, emphasis on basics including computer technology, phonics instead of look-say reading, and dedicated teaching. abstinence education in the home will lead to less need for birth control services and fewer abortions. we support educational initiatives to promote chastity until marriage as the expected standard of behavior. this education initiative is the best preventive measure to avoid the emotional trauma of sexually-transmitted diseases and teen pregnancies that are serious problems among our young people. while recognizing that something must be done to help children when parental consent or supervision is not possible, we oppose school-based clinics, which provide referrals, counseling, and related services for contraception and abortion. we encourage a reform agenda on the local level and urge state legislators to ensure quality education for all through programs of parental choice among public, private, and religious schools. that includes the option of home schooling, and republicans will defend the right of families to make that choice. we support and vigorously work for mechanisms, such as opportunity scholarships, block grants, school rebates, charter schools, and vouchers, to make parental choice in education a reality for all parents. on the federal level, we endorse legislation - like the watts-talent low-income educational opportunity act, which is part of the community renewal act of , and the coats-kasich educational choice and equity act - to set up model programs for empowering the families who need good schooling the most. we will continue to work for the return of voluntary prayer to our schools and will strongly enforce the republican legislation that guarantees equal access to school facilities by student religious groups. we encourage state legislatures to pass statutes which prohibit local school boards from adopting policies of denial regarding voluntary school prayer. we endorse bob dole's pledge that all federal education policies will be guided by his education consumer's warranty. the education consumer's warranty says that all american children should expect to: -- attend a safe school; -- be free from educational malpractice at the hands of bad schools, incompetent teachers, timid principals, and intrusive bureaucrats; -- find out exactly how well they and their school are doing (in terms of achievement) in relation to how well they ought to be doing; -- learn the three r's through proven methods; -- learn the nation's history and democratic values and study the classics of western civilization; -- attend a school that is free to innovate and isn't tied down by federal red tape; -- be confident that their high school diploma signifies a solid education, suitable for college or a good job; -- choose the school that's right for them; -- know that their tax dollars are reaching the classroom, not being siphoned off into overhead and bureaucracy; and, -- count on being able to arrive at college prepared to do freshman-level work. to reinforce our american heritage, we believe our nation's governors, state legislators, and local school boards should support requiring our public schools to dedicate one full day each year solely to studying the declaration of independence and the constitution. america's families find themselves on a college treadmill: the more they work to pay tuition, the faster it seems to increase. tuition has escalated far in excess of inflation, in defiance of market factors, and shows no sign of slowing down. billions of dollars are wasted on regulations, paperwork, and ""political correctness,"" which impedes the ability of the faculty to teach. we call for a national reassessment of the economics of higher education, to stop the treadmill and restore fiscal accountability to higher education. congressional republicans budgeted a percent increase in student loans while fighting bill clinton's intrusion of big government into their financing. heeding the outcry from the nation's campuses, we will end the clinton administration's perverse direct lending program. we support proposals to assist families to prepare for the financial strains of higher education, like the american dream savings account, passed by congressional republicans but vetoed. to protect the nation's colleges and universities against intolerance, we will work with independent educators to create alternatives to ideological accrediting bodies. we believe meeting the higher education needs of america will require new, public and private institutions that are flexible, able to apply new technologies, willing to provide access to all those who need it, cost-effective and that place no burden on the american taxpayer. improving america's health care our goal is to maintain the quality of america's health care - the best in the world, bar none - while making health care and health insurance more accessible and more affordable. that means allowing health care providers to respond to consumer demand through consumer choice. that approach stands in stark contrast to bill clinton's health plan of . ""clintoncare"" would have been a poison pill for the nation's health care system. congressional republicans countered with the right prescription: -- make insurance portable from job to job; -- ensure that persons are not denied coverage because of preexisting health conditions when changing employment; -- crack down on medicare and medicaid fraud, while preserving the confidentiality of medical records from inappropriate scrutiny and without imposing criminal penalties for clerical errors and billing mistakes; -- reform malpractice laws, to reduce the costly practice of ""defensive medicine"" and to make it easier for doctors to specialize in fields like obstetrics. we also recognize the vital importance of maintaining the confidentiality of the national practitioners data base; -- let individuals set up tax-free medical savings accounts (msas), so they can plan for their own medical needs instead of relying on government or insurance companies. republicans believe that medicare and medicaid recipients should also have the option to utilize medical savings accounts, which would result in huge savings for the american taxpayers; -- overhaul the food and drug administration to get better products on the market faster and at less cost to consumers; -- change irs rules that restrict coverage: let employer groups offer tax-exempt policies and make premiums % deductible for farmers, small businesses, and all the self-employed; -- promote a private market for long-term care insurance; -- reduce paperwork through electronic billing; -- change anti-trust laws to let health care providers cooperate in holding down charges; -- avoid mandatory coverages that make consumers pay for more insurance than they need; -- allow multi-employer purchasing groups and form ""risk pools"" in the states to make employee health insurance more affordable; -- remove regulatory barriers to the use of managed care for those who choose it. traditionally, all americans have had the freedom to choose their health care plans, as well as the providers who treat them. to ensure quality of care, it is imperative that patients continue to enjoy the freedoms to which they have become accustomed. communications between providers and patients should be free and open, and allow for full discussion of the patient's medical care. financial arrangements should not be a barrier to a patient's receiving quality medical care; -- permit families with incomes up to twice the poverty level to buy into medicaid; -- promote rural health care through telecommuni-cations and emergency air transport; and -- increase funding for community and migrant health centers. bill clinton and most congressional democrats opposed many of these reforms, especially medical savings accounts and changes in malpractice laws. congressional republicans rallied the nation to win a long overdue victory for consumers and for commonsense. three months away from the november elections, bill clinton caved in and promised to sign into law the republican solution to america's health care problems. but the clinton democrats are still blocking republican efforts to preserve, protect, and strengthen medicare. until medicare is financially secure again, our job is not finished. more than million people depend on medicare, which is rushing toward bankruptcy even more quickly than predicted. bill clinton doesn't seem to mind. despite repeated republican efforts to work with his administration to save medicare, his response has been a barrage of propaganda. we proposed medisave; he indulged in mediscare. we say this with solemn deliberation: bill clinton lied about the condition of medicare and lied about our attempts to save it. we reaffirm our determination to protect medicare. we will ensure a significant annual expansion in medicare. that isn't ""cutting medicare."" it's a projected average annual rate of growth of . percent a year - more than twice the rate of inflation - to ensure coverage for those who need it now and those who will need it in the future. we propose to allow unprecedented patient choice in medicare, so that older americans can select health care arrangements that work best for them, including provider-sponsored organizations offering quality care with strong consumer protections. our commitment is to protect the most vulnerable of our people: children, the elderly, the disabled. that is why we are determined to restructure medicaid, the federal-state program of health care for the poor. rife with fraud, poorly administered, with no incentives for patient or provider savings, medicaid has mushroomed into the nation's biggest welfare program. its staggering rate of growth threatens to overwhelm state budgets, while thwarting congressional progress towards a federal balanced budget. bill clinton's response has been to ignore the problem - and attack republicans for trying to solve it. we must find better ways to ensure quality health care for the poor. medicaid should be turned over to state management with leeway for restructuring and reform. low-income persons should have access to managed care programs and medical savings accounts, just as other persons do, and state officials should have authority to weed out substandard providers and to eliminate excess costs. we endorse republican legislation extending federal tort claim coverage to health care professionals who provide free medical services to persons who cannot afford them. preventive care is key to both wellness and lower medical bills, and strong families are the most powerful form of preventive care. responsible families mean less child abuse, lower infant mortality, fewer unvaccinated youngsters, fewer teen pregnancies, and less involvement with drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. to help low-income families toward those goals, we will unify scattered federal resources into block grants. we reaffirm our traditional support for generous funding of medical research, especially through the national institutes of health, and for continuing federal support for teaching hospitals and medical schools. we remain committed to, and place a high priority on, finding a cure for hiv disease. we support increased funding for research targeted at conditions that touch the families of most americans, like alzheimer's, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and diabetes. we call for an increased emphasis on prevention of diseases that threaten the lives of women. this requires dramatic expansion of outreach and education to expand public awareness. we call for fetal protection in biomedical research and will enforce the rights of human subjects in all federally funded studies. the value of medical research and preventive care to wellness and lower health care spending can be highlighted by the example of diabetes. approximately million people in the u.s. have diabetes, and percent of people above age are at risk for developing some form of the disease. diabetes is a leading cause of adult blindness, kidney disease, heart disease, stroke and amputations, and reduces life expectancy by up to percent. as much as percent of medicare expenditures are incurred in the treatment of diabetes-related complications. scientific discoveries, made possible by federal funding of medical research, have led to new efforts to prevent diabetes, as well as new treatment strategies to forestall the development of its debilitating and life threatening complications. today, people stricken with diabetes can, in concert with their health care providers, delay or prevent the serious and deadly complications of the disease. in other words, we now have the opportunity to reduce the burden of diabetes. renewing hope and opportunity ""thirty years ago, the 'great society' was liberalism's greatest hope, its greatest boast. today, it stands as its greatest shame, a grand failure that has crushed the spirit, destroyed the families, and decimated the culture of those who have become enmeshed in its web."" bob dole, may , , in fond du lac, wisconsin within a few weeks, bill clinton will sign into law a republican reform of welfare. with a straight face, after twice vetoing similar legislation, he will attempt to take credit for what we have accomplished. so be it. our cause is justice for both the taxpayers and for the poor. our purpose in welfare reform is not to save money but to bring into the mainstream of american life those who now are on the margins of our society and our economy. we will, in the words of the speaker of the house of representatives newt gingrich, replace the welfare state with an opportunity society for all. the clinton administration's ""reinventing government"" program to reform the welfare state bureaucracy has failed. in fact, management reforms of the reagan years were repealed and new labor-management councils that diluted efficient management were added as additional bureaucracy and red tape. we will revoke these clinton administration policies and oppose the liberal philosophy that bureaucracy can reform welfare. the current welfare system has spent $ trillion in the last thirty years and has been a catastrophic failure. despite this massive effort, conditions in our nation's poor communities have grown measurably worse. poverty used to be an economic problem; now it is a social pathology. the key to welfare reform is restoring personal responsibility and encouraging two-parent households. the path to that goal lies outside of official washington. in the hands of state and local officials, and under the eye of local taxpayers, welfare can again become a hand up instead of a handout. all able-bodied adults must be required to work, either in private sector jobs or in community work projects. illegal aliens must be ineligible for all but emergency benefits. and a firm time limit for receipt of welfare must be enforced. because illegitimacy is the most serious cause of child poverty, we will encourage states to stop cash payments to unmarried teens and set a family cap on payments for additional children. when benefits of any kind are extended to teen mothers, they must be conditioned upon their attendance at school and their living at home with a parent, adult relative, or guardian. about half the children of today's teen welfare mothers were fathered in statutory rape. we echo bob dole's call to our nation's governors to toughen and enforce state laws in this regard, as well as those concerning enforcement of child support. restoring common sense to welfare programs is only one side of the republican equation for hope and opportunity. the other side is giving low-income households the tools with which they can build their own future. we propose to do this along the lines of the american community renewal act, a republican congressional initiative that would establish throughout the nation up to renewal communities where residents, businesses, and investors would have unprecedented economic freedom and incentives to create prosperity. school choice for low-income families is an integral part of that initiative. we call for the removal of structural impediments which liberals throw in the path of poor people: over-regulation of start-up enterprises, excessive licensing requirements, needless restrictions on formation of schools and child-care centers catering to poor families, restrictions on providing public services in fields like transport and sanitation, and rigged franchises that close the opportunity door to all but a favored few. not everyone can make it on their own. government at various levels has a role - and some aid programs do work well - and so do private individuals and charitable and faith-based organizations, whose record of success far outshines that of any public welfare program. to promote personal involvement with anti-poverty efforts, we call for a charity tax credit that will be consistent with the fundamental changes we propose in the nation's system of taxation. to ensure that religiously affiliated institutions can fulfill their helping mission, we endorse republican legislation to stop discrimination against them in government programs. older americans our commitment to older americans runs throughout this platform. it strengthens our call for tax fairness, shows in our action agenda against violent crime, and motivates our crusade to preserve, protect, and strengthen medicare. the republican party has always opposed the earnings limitation for social security benefits, a confiscatory tax that discourages older americans from active engagement in all walks of life. while bill clinton imposed his new tax on social security benefits, he also initially vetoed our legislation to reform the earnings limitation, just as he vetoed our estate tax reform. the social security system remains the cornerstone of personal security for millions of the elderly. in , a republican president, working with the republican chairman of the senate finance committee - bob dole - saved the social security system from fiscal disaster. we have a legal and moral responsibility to america's seniors and will continue to do everything in our power to ensure that government honors our commitment to social security beneficiaries, now and in the future. we will keep it financially sound and keep politics out of its administration. we will work to ensure the integrity and solvency of the social security trust funds. those who are not older americans now will one day be so. our common goal is a secure economic future. to that end, public policy should encourage cooperative efforts by businesses and employees alike to expand the availability of savings vehicles for all. we want to expand retirement options so that individual choice, not government fiat, steers the decision-making process. we must increase both the amount and the portability of personal savings, especially in today's rapidly changing and unpredictable economy. we salute congressional republicans for their landmark legislation simplifying pension law, cutting away the red tape that prevented many businesses from offering pension plans, and establishing a new pension system designed to meet the needs of workers in small businesses. we also salute congressional republicans for making long-term care more affordable and more available to those who need it. too many seniors live in fear that they one day will incur long-term care costs that will wipe out their life savings and burden their children. the republican congress has passed legislation giving long-term care insurance policies the same tax-preferred treatment that health insurance policies now receive. over the years, this legislation will give millions of americans peace of mind and the financial wherewithal to obtain nursing home care of the highest quality. a cleaner, safer, healthier america ""those of us who grew up in rural america grew up with a common set of values, a code of living that stays with us all our lives. love of god and country and family. commitment to honesty, decency and personal responsibility. self-reliance tempered by a sense of community.... those values made us the greatest country on earth. and the secret to getting our country back on track is simply to return to them as a matter of national policy."" bob dole, august , , in ames, iowa we are the party of america's farmers, ranchers, foresters, and all who hold the earth in stewardship with the creator. republican leadership established the land grant college system under abraham lincoln, the national park system under ulysses grant, the national wildlife refuge system under teddy roosevelt, and today's legal protections for clean air and water in more recent decades. we reaffirm our commitment to agricultural progress, environmental improvement, and the prudent development of our natural resources. our goal is to continue the progress we have made to achieve a cleaner, safer, healthier environment for all americans - and to pass on to our children and grandchildren a better environment than we have today. we must recognize the unique role our states, localities, and private sector have in improving our environment. the states and communities are the laboratories of environmental innovation. inflexible requirements hurt the environment, add unnecessary costs, and reduce technology development. while we have made substantial environmental progress, we must reject failed approaches created by fearmongering and centralized control which will not serve our environment well in the century ahead. the superfund program to clean up abandoned toxic waste sites is a classic case in point. more than half of the $ billion already spent on superfund has gone for litigation and administration. in other words, trial lawyers have profited from the current flawed and unfair liability scheme, while toxic waste sites wait to be cleaned up. without the opposition of bill clinton, we will fix the broken superfund law. we will direct resources to clean-up sites where there are real risks, and cooperate with citizens, states, and localities who want to help, rather than harassing them with unwarranted lawsuits. the states have been leaders in returning contaminated sites to productive use under ""brownfields"" programs. these programs tailor clean-up standards appropriate for expected future use, thus enabling environmental cleanup and economic development. accordingly, as an essential component of our comprehensive superfund reform, we will remove disincentives in current federal law in order to allow states to expand their innovative ""brownfields"" programs. inconsistent federal policies have created a nightmare for our nation's ports at a critical time of growth and change in international trade. we must protect the environment while recognizing the unique situation of each port. there must be a coordination of state, local, and federal roles in encouraging our ports to expand to meet current and future needs. republicans trust americans to honor their shared desire to live and raise their children in a clean and healthy environment. for all environmental problems, we propose a common sense approach based on flexibility and consensus, that builds a better future on free enterprise, local control, sound science, and technology development. this is our positive and proactive agenda: -- assure that the air and water are clean and safe for our children and future generations; -- assure that everyone has access to public outdoor recreation areas; and that historic and environmentally significant wilderness and wetlands areas will be protected without compromising our commitment to the rights of property owners; -- set reasonable standards for environmental improvement that incorporate flexibility, acknowledge geographic differences, and create incentives for development of new technologies; -- base all government environmental decisions on the best peer-reviewed scientific evidence, while encouraging advancements in research; -- achieve progress, as much as possible, through incentives rather than compulsion, and improve compliance by letting states and localities play a greater role in setting and maintaining standards. many states have enacted environmental education and ""voluntary self-audit"" laws to encourage people to find and correct pollution; the congress should remove disincentives for states to achieve these goals; and -- assure private property owners of due process to protect their rights, and make environmental decisions in concert with those whose homes, businesses, and communities are directly affected. our commitment to an improved environment is best embodied in the recently enacted amendments to the safe drinking water act. this republican initiative will guarantee all americans a safe and clean source of drinking water and will grant local communities the flexibility to avoid unnecessary requirements. the clinton democrats disagree with our principles. they have increased spending by creating new bureaucratic programs, creating new paperwork requirements, and funding pet projects of their special interest friends. however, the clinton administration has failed to reduce regulatory burdens on states, localities, and individuals. it has failed to create incentives for environmental improvements or use sound science and cooperation to achieve environmental goals. today, they are planning to impose scientifically unsupported, massive new regulations on ozone and particulates. these rules will impose new requirements on cities, add unnecessary costs, and destroy jobs without adequate justification. republicans support the ongoing efforts of the states and communities to ensure reliable and safe water supplies. as the federal government moves away from its past role as a grant giver and direct lender in the development of water-related infrastructure, we will encourage the establishment of public-private partnerships to build and finance our nation's water infrastructure. we recognize the great lakes encompass one-fifth of the fresh water supply of the entire world and we oppose any diversion of great lakes water. republicans have always advocated conserving our animal and plant resources, but we recognize the current endangered species act is seriously flawed and, indeed, is often counterproductive because of its reliance on federal command-and-control measures. the adherence of clinton democrats to these discredited esa provisions has devastated the environment they pretend to protect by virtually encouraging landowners to remove habitat for marginal species to avoid government seizure of their property. we will improve the esa by implementing an incentive based program in cooperation with state, local, and tribal governments and private individuals to recognize the critical relationship between a healthy environment and a healthy economy founded on private property rights and responsibilities. securing property rights republicans consider private property rights the cornerstone of environmental progress. that lesson has been confirmed in the tragic environmental record of communist rule and of socialist regimes in the less developed world. by safeguarding those rights - by enforcing the takings clause of the fifth amendment and by providing compensation - we not only stand true to the constitution but advance sound environmentalism as well. republicans, led by senator dole, have spearheaded efforts in congress to protect private property rights. improving public lands the nation's public lands - half the territory in the west - must be administered both for today's multiple uses and for tomorrow's generations. we support multiple use conducted in an environmentally and economically sustainable manner. we will preserve priority wilderness and wetlands - real wetlands of environmental significance, not the damp grounds of a bureaucrat's imagination. we support a thorough review of the lands owned by the federal government with a goal of transferring lands that can best be managed by state, county, or municipal governments. this review should ensure that the federal government retains ownership to unique property worthy of national oversight. properties transferred from federal control must recognize existing property and mineral rights, including water, mining claims, grazing permits, rights of access, hunting, fishing, and contracts. we recognize the historic use of public lands for livestock production in compliance with legal requirements. our renewable rangeland should continue to be available under conditions that ensure both expanded production of livestock and protection of the rangeland environment. we condemn the clinton administration's range war against this pillar of the western economy. we recognize the need to keep our national park system healthy and accessible to all. our national parks have a backlog of more than four billion dollars in maintenance and infrastructure repair projects. the nation's natural crown jewels are losing some of their luster, tarnished by neglect and indifference. our park system needs to be rebuilt, restructured, and reinvigorated to ensure that all americans can enjoy and be proud of their parks. we stand for sustainable forestry to stabilize and provide continuity for our timber industry and to improve the health of the country's public forests. this requires active management practices, such as the responsible salvage harvesting of dead and diseased trees. the democrats' hands-off approach has made our great forests vulnerable to ravaging fires, insects, and disease. the democrats' policies have devastated the economy of timber-dependent communities across the pacific northwest and in the tongass national forest, the nation's largest and most productive, to please elite special interests. we join families and communities in rural america who rely on public forests for their livelihood in calling for the federal government to carefully evaluate the socioeconomic impacts of its actions and to live up to its commitments to provide an adequate timber supply to dependent communities through sustainable forest management. we reaffirm the traditional deference by the federal government to the states in the allocation and appropriation of water. we deplore the clinton administration's disregard for state primacy through attempts to preempt state law with respect to water usage and watershed protection. we also recognize the need to protect adequate supplies of water for agriculture without unreasonable government mandates. we support the original intent of the mining law of : to provide the certainty and land tenure necessary for miners to risk tremendous capital investment on federal lands, thus preserving jobs - indeed, whole industries - and bolstering our domestic economy. we support appropriate changes to the law to ensure the taxpayer will receive a reasonable return for the value of extracted minerals. we oppose extremist attempts to shut down american mining in favor of our international competitors. power for progress our goal is an energy supply available to all - competitively priced, secure, and clean - produced by healthy industries operating in an environmentally responsible manner using domestically available resources to the greatest extent practicable. no one should take that for granted. today's energy boom was hard won by republican reforms in the 1980s, ending more than three decades of ruinous federal meddling that drove up prices and drove down supplies. now that progress is under attack from the same quarters that brought us energy crises, gas rationing, and dangerous dependence on unreliable supplies of foreign oil. that dependency is percent today, and will be two-thirds in only a few short years. it does not have to be this way. the clinton administration has learned nothing from the collapse of liberalism. it clings to outdated regulation that stifles production and drives up consumer prices. clinton proposed a punishing btu energy tax that would have penalized consumers and cost thousands of jobs. after republicans derailed that bad idea, bill clinton championed - and congressional democrats approved - a .-cent per gallon gas tax hike, not to improve roads and bridges, but for general spending. now the clinton administration demands lighter cars and family trucks to meet its corporate average fuel economy (cafe) goals, at the cost of thousands of lives lost every year in auto accidents - not to mention the cost in jobs lost to foreign auto makers. nowhere has the failure of presidential leadership been more apparent than in clinton's position on finding a reasonable long-term solution to our nation's nuclear waste disposal problem. we support the federal government's obligation under contract to take possession of nuclear waste and remove it from temporary storage in over states across the country. at the same time, we believe that the siting and licensing of both permanent and interim storage facilities should be based on sound science and not solely upon political expediency. the clinton approach hobbles the nation's progress. our program of energy renewal, on the other hand, is an essential component of broader opportunity for all. we must finish the job of preparing america's energy capacity to meet the challenges of the 21st century. today, republican governors and the states are leading the way to true and meaningful electric utility industry deregulation and competition and lower rates for all consumers. restructuring the electric utility industry presents both great opportunities and challenges for our nation. we support greater competition as we move toward a market-based approach, with true and meaningful deregulation, after an appropriate and fair transition period that allows for competitive retail markets while ensuring reliability of service in a cost-effective manner for all consumers. we support elimination of the department of energy to emphasize the need for greater privatization and to reduce the size of the federal government. the department of energy's defense concerns should be transferred to an independent agency under the defense department. other necessary programs should be farmed out to other departments and offices. we support environmentally responsible energy extraction from public and private lands. we will not tolerate poor reclamation or pollution from mining or drilling. we advocate environmentally sound oil production in the largest known onshore or offshore petroleum reserve in the nation - the small coastal plain portion of the -million acre arctic national wildlife refuge. oil produced there, traveling through an existing pipeline, will bring billions of dollars in revenues to reduce the federal budget deficit. on the other hand, without anwr coastal plain development, we will lose hundreds of thousands of potential jobs and untold billions of american dollars will be paid to foreign governments for the oil not produced from our home reserves. we continue to support and encourage the development of our domestic natural gas industry. natural gas is a clean, abundant, and domestically available resource, which can be provided, transported, and consumed in an environmentally responsible manner. we will delegate management and collection of federal oil and gas royalties to the states, thereby increasing receipts both to the states and to the federal treasury. this action will reduce bureaucratic involvement and administrative costs to the federal government. we urge the federal government to expedite and streamline the exploration, leasing, and permitting process for the domestic oil and gas industry. the coal industry now supplies more than half of all electric generation and is vital for our entire economy. we encourage research for cleaner coal combustion technologies and will require that objective, peer-reviewed science be the basis for environmental decisions that increase costs for electric rate payers. because no single source of energy can reliably supply the needs of the american people, we believe in fostering alternative and renewable energy sources to assist in reducing dependence on unreliable foreign oil supplies. we anticipate the continuing development of energy from coal, oil, natural gas, agricultural products such as ethanol and biodiesel, nuclear, and hydro sources and where economically competitive, from wind, solar, and geothermal power. the united states should continue its commitment to addressing global climate change in a prudent and effective manner that does not punish the u.s. economy. despite scientific uncertainty about the role of human activity in climate change, the clinton administration has leapfrogged over reasoned scientific inquiry and now favors misdirected measures, such as binding targets and timetables, imposed only on the united states and certain other developed countries, to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions. republicans deplore the arbitrary and premature abandonment of the previous policy of voluntary reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. we further deplore ceding u.s. sovereignty on environmental issues to international bureaucrats and our foreign economic competitors. energy policy and transportation policy go hand in hand. to prepare the national highway system and the national aviation system for the 21st century, we will maintain the integrity of the federal transportation trust funds and respect the call by republican governors to ensure those funds are returned to the states with a minimum of federal red tape. trusting the people, congressional republicans passed the national highway system designation act of , returning to the states decisions about highway safety. we support reasonable speed limits, reflecting local needs and geography, and prudent personal safety measures, but we oppose washington's one-size-fits-all approach to the mobility of the american people. agriculture in the 21st century the moral strength abundant on america's farms and rural communities has been the foundation and source of strength for our nation since its earliest days. america's settlers built their farming communities on values like faith, hard work, dedication, and self-sacrifice. republicans see a very bright future for agriculture and rural america. our program to strengthen rural america will benefit every sector of the economy and every part of the nation. first and foremost, we will reduce the tax burden - both the estate tax and the capital gains levy - on those who produce america's food and fiber. this is essential to preserve production agriculture. just like urban small businesses, rural producers need full deductibility of health insurance premiums and an overall tax structure that is simpler and fairer. deficit spending by government is death by strangulation for agriculture. our farms are major users of capital, with over $ billion in current borrowing. interest payments are one of their heaviest burdens. the republican balanced budget of last year, vetoed by bill clinton, would have saved farmers more than $ billion in interest costs by the year . we stand with the american farmer in demanding an end to the spending excesses in official washington. the elections of were a resounding victory for american agriculture. the first republican majorities in both the house and senate in years won an historic breakthrough with the ""freedom to farm"" act. for the first time in six decades, federal policy will allow individual farmers to grow what makes sense on their own land, not what a bureaucrat wants grown there. ""freedom to farm"" will permit them to respond to world trade opportunities for value-added exports that bring new jobs and broader prosperity to rural america. moreover, the republican ""freedom to farm"" act is the most pro-environment farm bill ever. by liberating high-tech, high-yield u.s. agriculture to pursue ever greater levels of efficiency, it will enable growers to produce more from less land, saving wildlife habitat and fragile soils from the plow. the new law allows farmers to rotate crops, thereby reducing use of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizer. it continues the conservation and wetland reserve programs and creates a new environmental quality incentive program to help farmers do what they do best - conserve the land and pass it on, enriched and enhanced, to future generations. while promising to modernize farm programs, the clinton administration instead advanced failed ""new deal"" policies. throughout the ensuing debate, they fought every effort by congress to get the hand of government out of agriculture. finally, having agreed to ""freedom to farm,"" bill clinton is threatening to repeal this historic legislation, undercutting long-term planning by farmers across the country. in contrast, ""freedom to farm"" ends the command-and-control policies that have choked the entrepreneurial spirit of rural america. ""freedom to farm"" permits experimentation with new crops and new markets, just in time to meet an explosion in worldwide demand for food, fiber, fuels and industrial products. we reaffirm our historical and continuing support for the expanded use of biodiesel and ethanol to improve the rural economy and reduce our dependence on imported oil. experts predict the need for u.s. producers to triple their output over the next years. ""freedom to farm"" positions them to meet the challenge of feeding a hungry and troubled world. while ""freedom to farm"" greatly reduced usda paperwork imposed on farmers, much remains to be done to reduce the regulations that add about $, per farm per year to the cost of farming. our extensive program of regulatory reform is explained elsewhere in this platform. republicans worked hard for and applaud the repeal of the delaney clause and the reform of food safety laws. these changes allow a responsible approach toward crop production and ensure the quality of the nation's food supply, with special protections for our children. we reaffirm the republican party's historic commitment to agricultural progress through research and education, starting with the system of land grant colleges established in . for the new century, as in the days of lincoln, farming must look ahead to innovation and constant improvement, especially biotechnology and precision farming techniques. restoring american world leadership ""it's time to restore american leadership throughout the world. our future security depends on american leadership that is respected, american leadership that is trusted, and when necessary, american leadership that is feared."" bob dole we are the party of peace through strength. republicans put the interests of our country over those of other nations - and of the united nations. we believe the safety and prosperity of the american home and workplace depend upon ensuring our national security in a dangerous world. this principle was proven in our long struggle against communism, and - as recent events have tragically shown - it is still true today. the gains we made for democracy around the world under two republican presidents are now imperiled by a rudderless foreign policy. we vigorously support restoring the promotion of democracy worldwide as a cornerstone of u.s. foreign policy. democracy is the best guarantor of peace and will ensure greater respect for fundamental human rights and the rule of law. the international situation - and our country's security against the purveyors of evil - has worsened over the last three and a half years. today, russia's democratic future is more uncertain than at any time since the hammer and sickle was torn from the kremlin towers. with impunity, fidel castro has shot american citizens out of the skies over international waters. north korea has won unprecedented concessions regarding its nuclear capability from the clinton administration. much of africa has dissolved in tragedy - somalia, rwanda, burundi, liberia. the clinton administration objected to lifting the arms embargo on bosnia while it facilitated the flow of iranian weapons to that country. bill clinton made tough campaign pledges on china but subsequently failed in his attempt to bluff the chinese government - diminishing american prestige while not addressing the serious issues of human rights, regional stability, and nuclear proliferation. bill clinton's weakness, indecision, and double-talk, have undermined america's role as leader of the free world. in , the nation's choice is clear: either we return responsible leadership to the white house , or bill clinton's lack of international purpose results in catastrophe. we must keep our country strong and sovereign, and assert the interests and values of the united states in the international arena. the atlantic alliance and europe ""let us begin by reaffirming that europe's security is indispensable to the security of the united states, and that american leadership is absolutely indispensable to the security of europe."" - bob dole, june , the atlantic alliance: our relations with the nations of europe must continue to be based on the nato alliance, which remains the worlds' strongest bulwark of freedom and international stability. our policy will strive to consolidate our cold war victory in europe and to build a firm foundation for a new century of peace. in the same spirit that ronald reagan called for the integration of spain into the nato alliance, we call for the immediate expansion of the framework for peace to include those countries of central europe which demonstrate the strongest commitment to the democratic ideals nato was created to protect. with the people of poland, the czech republic, and hungary we have special bonds. these nations - and others - are rightfully part of the future of europe. as bob dole said, ""it is an outrage that the patriots who threw off the chains of soviet bondage have been told by bill clinton that they must wait to join the nato alliance."" we strongly endorse bob dole's call for poland, the czech republic, and hungary to enter nato by . bosnia: we support america's men and women in uniform who are serving in bosnia and herzegovina. however, we did not support the ill-conceived and inconsistent policies that led to their deployment. in , candidate bill clinton pledged to lift the arms embargo on bosnia, but once in office he ignored his promises. for three years, bill clinton upheld the illegal and unjust arms embargo on bosnia and allowed genocidal aggression to go virtually unchallenged, while bob dole successfully led the effort in the congress to lift the u.s. arms embargo. once again, bill clinton subordinated american national interests to the united nations in vetoing bipartisan legislation that would have lifted the u.s. arms embargo and rendered the deployment of american forces unnecessary. at the same time bill clinton was opposing congressional efforts to lift the arms embargo, he made a secret decision to allow the terrorist iranian regime to supply arms to bosnia. this duplicitous policy has endangered u.s. and allied forces and given iran a foothold in europe. we look forward to a timely withdrawal of u.s. forces from bosnia and recognize that providing the bosnian federation with adequate weapons and training is the only realistic exit strategy. we support the democratic process in bosnia and, when conditions exist, the conduct of free and fair elections. we support bringing indicted war criminals to justice. we encourage the peoples of the region - and in particular those of croatia, bosnia and herzegovina, and serbia and montenegro - to play a constructive role in fostering peace and stability there. we note with concern that repression and human rights abuses are escalating in kosova and support the appointment of a u.s. special envoy to help resolve the situation there. russia: we salute the people of russia in their quest for democracy and a free market economy. during this crucial period, the clinton administration has pursued an accommodationist and misguided policy toward moscow. bill clinton's comparison of russia's extreme brutality in chechnya to the american civil war is offensive. the clinton administration's passivity in the face of russia's intimidation and economic blackmail against countries of the former soviet union has encouraged the rise of extreme nationalist and undemocratic forces. its willingness to accept russian changes to already agreed-to arms control treaties has undermined security. its complacency over russia's sale of nuclear technology to iran and cuba has contributed to the threat of nuclear proliferation. our foreign policy toward russia should put american interests first and consolidate our cold war victory in europe. we have a national interest in a security relationship with a democratic russia. specifically, we will encourage russia to respect the sovereignty and independence of its neighbors; support a special security arrangement between russia and nato - but not moscow's veto over nato enlargement; support russian entry to the g- after its reforms have been achieved; and link u.s. assistance to russian adherence to international treaty obligations. newly independent states: we reaffirm our party's historic commitment to the independence of all former captive nations still recovering from the long night of soviet communism, especially latvia, lithuania, estonia, armenia, and ukraine. we endorse republican legislation to establish in washington, d. c., funded by private contributions, an international memorial to the one hundred million victims of communism. ireland: we support efforts to establish peace with justice in northern ireland through a peace process inclusive of all parties who reject violence. during this difficult period in irish history, we encourage private u. s. investment in the north, fully consistent with the macbride principles for fair employment, in order to address the systemic discriminatory practices that still exist, especially against catholics, in the workplace and elsewhere. we call on all parties to renounce terrorism in the northern ireland conflict. cyprus: we encourage a peaceful settlement for cyprus and respect by all parties for the wishes of the cypriot people. concerned about continuing tension in the aegean sea, we will maintain close ties to both greece and turkey and urge all parties to refrain from precipitous actions and assertions contrary to legally established territorial arrangements. defending america against missile attack we face two scandalous situations. first, most americans do not realize our country has no defense against long-range missile attack. second, the current occupant of the oval office refuses to tell them of that danger. so we will. this is the frightening truth: the united states provided the technology to israel to protect it from iraqi missile attacks during the persian gulf war, but president clinton refuses to provide the technology - technology that is readily available - to the american people to protect our country from the growing threat posed by long-range ballistic missiles. the strategic defense initiative (sdi) of the last two republican administrations has been dismantled by bill clinton, who - contrary to the national security interests of the united states - clings to the obsolete cold war abm treaty. clinton slashed the funding budgeted by past presidents for missile defense and even violates the law by slowing down critical theater missile defenses. he has pursued negotiations to actually expand the outdated abm treaty, further tying america's hands, and hobbling our self defense. he now seeks new limitations that will hinder the united states from developing and deploying even theater ballistic missile defenses to protect our troops abroad. in a peaceful world, such limitations would be imprudent. in today's world, they are immoral. the danger of a missile attack with nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons is the most serious threat to our national security. communist china has mocked our vulnerability by threatening to attack los angeles if we stand by our historic commitment to the republic of china on taiwan. we are vulnerable to blackmail - nuclear or otherwise - from a host of terrorist states that are now trying to acquire the instruments of doom. in the face of those dangers, bill clinton has ignored his responsibilities. in the most egregious instance, he directed that a national intelligence estimate focus only on the missile threat to the continental united states, deliberately ignoring the near-term menace posed to alaska and hawaii by long-range missiles now being developed or otherwise acquired by the communists who rule north korea. america will be increasingly threatened by long-range ballistic missiles in the near future, but there also exists today a more immediate threat from the proliferation of shorter-range, or ""theater"" missiles. bill clinton says that theater missile defense (tmd) is a top priority of his administration, yet refuses to provide adequate funding for our most promising and effective tmd programs. for example, not only has he recently cut funding by % for the theater high altitude area defense (thaad) program, but he has also failed to request sufficient funds to develop and deploy the navy upper tier system. republicans will fully fund and deploy these and other tmd systems to protect american troops and vital interests abroad. the republican party is committed to the protection of all americans - including our two million citizens in alaska and hawaii - against missile attack. we are determined to deploy land-based and sea-based theater missile defenses as soon as possible, and a national system thereafter. we will not permit the mistakes of past diplomacy, based on the immoral concept of mutual assured destruction, to imperil the safety of our nation, our armed forces abroad, and our allies. arms control will be a means to enhance american national security, not an end in itself. we therefore endorse the defend america act of , introduced by senator bob dole which calls for a national missile defense system for all fifty states by the year . to cope with the threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the united states will have to deter the threat or use of weapons of mass destruction by rogue states. this in turn will require the continuing maintenance and development of nuclear weapons and their periodic testing. the clinton administration's proposed comprehensive test ban treaty (ctbt) is inconsistent with american security interests. rebuilding america's strength republicans are committed to ensuring the status of the united states as the world's preeminent military power. we must reverse the decline in what our nation spends for defense. in just three and a half years, an amateur approach to military matters and dramatic reductions in defense spending under the clinton administration have had a serious negative impact on the readiness and capabilities of our armed forces. in , three of the army's primary combat divisions reported unacceptably low levels of readiness, and all forward-deployed army divisions reported below par readiness ratings. not since the ""hollow army"" days of jimmy carter have army readiness levels been so low. funding shortfalls and shortages of spare parts and munitions are limiting training opportunities and thus the combat readiness of our forces. at the same time, bill clinton's peacekeeping operations and other global ventures have increased the operational demands on the limited forces available, extended the duration of their deployments, and put immense strains on service members and their families - without any discernible benefit to u.s. national security. republicans faced a similar situation with a deteriorating military in , but then two republican presidents turned things around and restored america's world leadership. we must do it again, and quickly. the all-volunteer force is composed of the finest military personnel in the world today. these outstanding men and women deserve a civilian leadership committed to providing them with the resources, technology, and equipment they need to safely and successfully perform their missions. they deserve nothing but the best from the people they protect. we recognize that today's military research and development, as well as procurement, is tomorrow's readiness. we are committed to readiness not just today, but also tomorrow. bill clinton has decimated our research and development effort, and slashed procurement for our armed forces. not since have we spent so little on new weapons for our military. fortunately, the republican congress has restored some of the funding bill clinton sought to cut for research and development and for procurement. only a commander-in-chief who fully understands and respects the military can rebuild america's defense capabilities. the clinton administration's own inadequate defense ""strategy"" has been underfunded. the mismatch between strategy, forces, and resources poses an enormous potential risk to america's military personnel and vital interests. this mismatch must be resolved now, before regional crises erupt and find our nation unprepared. a republican president will immediately conduct a thorough review that will require resources and programs to be redirected according to goals set by the president instead by the bureaucracy. money alone is not the answer. it must be spent the right way, with long-term efficiencies in mind. we call for reductions in the overhead and infrastructure of the defense department and successful demonstrations of weapons and equipment prior to full scale purchases. budgetary decisions must be made with an eye to preserving the nation's defense industrial base, accelerating procurement of key military and dual-use technologies, incorporating emerging technologies into military operations, and maintaining an adequate, safe and reliable capability in nuclear weapons. only a republican president and a republican congress can fulfill these duties. protecting american interests we scorn the clintonite view that soon ""nationhood as we know it will be obsolete; all states will recognize a single global authority."" this is nonsense, but it explains why the democrat administration has lurched from one foreign policy fiasco to the next - and why bill clinton vetoed the first legislative restructuring of america's diplomatic institutions in a half century. a republican president will reform the department of state to ensure that america's interests always come first. republicans will not subordinate united states sovereignty to any international authority. we oppose the commitment of american troops to u.n. ""peacekeeping"" operations under foreign commanders and will never compel american servicemen to wear foreign uniforms or insignia. we will insist on an end to waste, mismanagement, and fraud at the united nations. we will ensure american interests are pursued and defended at the united nations, will not tolerate any international taxation by the organization, nor will we permit any international court to seize, try, or punish american citizens. before his departure from the senate, bob dole introduced legislation prohibiting u.s. payments to the united nations and any of its agencies if they attempt to implement global taxes. we support the passage of the prohibition on united nations taxation act of to preserve america's sovereignty and the american taxpayer's right to taxation with representation. a republican president will withdraw from senate consideration any pending international conventions or treaties that erode the constitutional foundations of our republic and will neither negotiate nor submit such agreements in the future. we will ensure that our future relations with international organizations not infringe upon either the sovereignty of the united states or the earnings of the american taxpayer. american citizens must retain ownership of their private property, and must maintain full control of our national and state parks, without international interference. international terrorism terrorist states have made a comeback during bill clinton's administration. he has treated their rulers with undue respect and failed to curb their acquisition of weapons of mass destruction. although congressional republicans passed anti-terrorism legislation earlier this year, the clinton administration has not implemented many key provisions of the law. it has not been used to freeze terrorists' assets, deny terrorists' visas, cut off foreign aid to supporters of terrorist states, or halt terrorist fundraising in the united states. the clinton administration has not implemented the anti terrorist research program established and funded by congress in the aviation security act. a republican president will forcefully lead the world community to isolate and punish state sponsors of terrorism. it is vital to our security that we actively work to reverse the threat posed by these regimes - through imposition and enforcement of sanctions, banning investment, and leading our allies in effective policies. the governments of north korea, iran, syria, iraq, libya, sudan, and cuba must know that america's first line of defense is not our shoreline, but their own borders. we will be proactive, not reactive, to strike the hand of terrorism before it can be raised against americans. we denounce terrorist attacks made on american citizens at home or abroad. we must take all legitimate steps to swiftly apprehend and severely punish persons committing terrorists acts. however, we must also denounce any attempts to deprive law-abiding citizens of their god-given, constitutionally-protected rights while fighting terrorism. to take away the liberty of the american people while fighting terrorism is repugnant to the history and character of our nation. we firmly oppose any legislation that would infringe upon the rights of american citizens to freedom of religion, speech, press, and assembly; the right to keep and bear arms; and the right to judicial due process. africa we support those u. s. aid programs to africa which have proven records of success, especially the child survival program of vitamins, immunizations, sanitation, and oral rehydration. we hail the social and economic progress of those nations which have used the free market to liberate the talent and striving of their people. they deserve our attention, but our outreach must be on a case by-case basis. our hope for the future of south africa, for example, stands in contrast with the military rule now imposed on nigeria, the continent's most populous country. the republican party's commitment to freedom and human rights in africa is as old as the establishment of the republic of liberia. today, the tragic fate of that small nation symbolizes the larger tragedy that has befallen much of the continent. the clinton administration's dismal performance in somalia, resulting in needless american deaths, set the stage for international passivity in the face of genocide in rwanda and burundi. the clinton administration has even failed to rally the world against the slave trade sponsored by the government of the sudan, whose persecution of sudanese christians and others is nothing short of genocide. a republican president will not tolerate this unconscionable treatment of children and women. asia bill clinton's foreign policy failures loom large in asia. four years ago, most of that continent was rushing toward democratic reform. today it threatens to slip backwards into conflict and repression. a republican administration will keep the mutual security treaties with japan and with the republic of korea as the foundation of our role in the region. we will halt bill clinton's efforts to appease north korea by rewarding treaty-breaking with american taxpayer-financed oil and nuclear reactors. we will make further improvement of relations with vietnam and north korea contingent upon their cooperation in achieving a full and complete accounting of our pow's and mia's from those asian conflicts. china and taiwan: we support the aspiration of the chinese people for both economic and political liberty, which includes respect for the human rights of the people of tibet. our relationship with the chinese government will be based on vigilance with regard to its military potential, proliferation activities, and its attitude toward human rights, especially in hong kong. the taiwan relations act must remain the basis for our relations with the republic of china on taiwan. we reaffirm our commitment to taiwan's security and will regard any threat to alter its status by force as a threat to our own security interests. we will make available to taiwan the material it needs for self-defense, particularly theater missile defense and coastal patrol submarines. in recognition of its growing importance in the global economy, we support a larger role for taiwan in international organizations. philippines: we reaffirm our historic friendship with the philippine people, which has endured through changing circumstances. the middle east peace through strength continues to be central in the middle east. saddam hussein reminded us just five years ago of the potential for aggression by radical states in this region. republicans understand the importance of maintaining a robust u.s. military capability in the eastern mediterranean and the persian gulf, cooperating with our allies to ensure regional stability. republicans also understand the need to be willing to use force to deter aggression and, where deterrence fails, to defeat it. that is why republicans were the bedrock of support for the congressional vote to authorize the use of force against iraq's aggression in , while most democrats voted against operation desert storm. the middle east remains a region vital to american security. our enduring goals there are to promote freedom and stability, secure access to oil resources, and maintain the security of israel, our one democratic ally in the region with whom we share moral bonds and common strategic interests. most of the world's oil exports flow from the middle east, and thus its strategic significance remains. but it is still the most volatile region in the world. islamic radicalism, increasing terrorism, and rogue states like iran, iraq, syria, and libya threaten regional and international stability. in this environment, israel's demonstrated strategic importance to the u.s. as our most reliable and capable ally in this part of the world is more critical than ever. that is why israel's security is central to u.s. interests in the region. that is why republican administrations initiated efforts with israel to pre-position military equipment, to conduct joint contingency planning and joint military exercises. that is why we advocate continuing cooperation on the arrow missile, boost phase intercept, and the nautilus programs. that is why we look toward the greater integration of israel into our regional defense planning and wish to explore ways to enhance our strategic cooperation. that is why we have continued to support full funding for aid to israel despite cuts in the foreign assistance budget, and why we applaud the country's commitment toward economic self-sufficiency. we reaffirm that republican commitment to maintain israel's qualitative military advantage over any adversary or group of adversaries. while we fully support israel's efforts to find peace and security with its neighbors, we will judge the peace process by the security it generates both for israel and for the united states. in that context, we support israel's right to make its own decisions regarding security and boundaries. we strongly oppose the clinton administration's attempts to interfere in israel's democratic process. we applaud the republican congress for enacting legislation to recognize jerusalem as the undivided capital of israel. a republican administration will ensure that the u.s. embassy is moved to jerusalem by may . we honor the memory of israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin, and express our support for the new government of prime minister benjamin netanyahu. we applaud those leaders in the arab world, president mubarak and king hussein, who have spoken courageously and acted boldly for the cause of peace. we endorse continued assistance and support for countries which have made peace with israel - led by egypt and later joined by jordan. republican leadership will support others who follow their example, while isolating terrorist states until they are fit to rejoin the community of nations. western hemisphere the u.s. commitment to democratic institutions and market economies in the western hemisphere has paralleled our enduring interest in the security of the region, as laid out in the monroe doctrine. the success of republican national security policies in the 1980s halted soviet imperialism and promoted the process of economic and political reform in latin america - defeating totalitarianism of the right and of the left. during the last decade and a half, latin american countries have made enormous progress developing democratic institutions. we applaud their progress and offer our assistance to further expand and deepen democratic conditions in the region. hemispheric progress toward free and democratic societies has stalled during the clinton administration. a government bought and paid for by drug traffickers holds power in colombia. mexico - with whom we share hundreds of miles of border - is increasingly tainted by narcotics related corruption at all levels of society. similarly, there are signs of backsliding on democracy in latin america, most notably in paraguay, where a coup was narrowly averted earlier this year. we call for a new partnership among the democratic nations of the western hemisphere to protect our hard-won victories against dictatorial government. this new partnership must address the most recent and dangerous threat to the hemisphere - narcotics traffickers and their trade. the emergence of the western hemisphere as an area - apart from cuba - which shares our ideals of economic and political liberty must also mean close cooperation with the united states on a range of security issues. the clinton administration's policy of denying most latin american nations the opportunity to replace their obsolescent military equipment, raise the professional competence of their armed forces, and cooperate fully with the united states in joint military training and exercises will be reversed by a republican administration. we cherish our special relationship with the people of mexico and canada. in a spirit of mutual respect, we believe the forthright discussion of economic and social issues that may divide us is in the best interest of all three nations. bill clinton's outreach to castro has only delayed the emergence of ""cuba libre,"" extending the duration of communist tyranny. the republican party has not wavered and will not waver in its goal of a democratic cuba. we affirm our policy of isolating the castro regime, including full implementation of the helms-burton act to penalize foreign firms which do business there. bill clinton's awkward and misguided intervention in haiti has cost american taxpayers some $ billion and risked the lives of american military personnel for a less than vital interest. we reject clinton administration claims of ""success"" in its military intervention in haiti. human rights abuses by government forces go unpunished, promised economic reforms have not been made, and the democratic process is deeply flawed. security and foreign assistance america is and must remain the leader of the world. we did not win the cold war without allies and friends, and we hope to face future challenges with them. our country should not bear world burdens alone. providing friendly nations with access to u.s. defense equipment can protect american security interests abroad and reduce the likelihood that american forces will have to be directly engaged in military conflict. the clinton administration has been blind to that wisdom. we have seen the result in bosnia, where american ground forces have been deployed because the clinton administration denied bosnia the opportunity to acquire defense equipment in the united states. the clinton administration has diverted aid from our friends to support u.n. operations and social welfare spending in the third world. congressional republicans have done all they could to resist this folly. only a republican president can put an end to it. the clinton administration's failure to couple american interests abroad with foreign aid has produced wasteful spending and has presented an impediment to achieving a balanced budget. a republican administration will ensure foreign aid is cost-effective and based on its important role in directly promoting american national interests. protecting america's technological edge american scientific and industrial leadership is one of the critical factors sustaining american security. our technological edge is at risk not only because of the clinton administration's refusal to sustain an adequate investment in defense modernization, but also its virtual abandonment of national security-related export controls. acquisition of technology by aspiring proliferators of weapons of mass destruction has been irresponsibly facilitated. a republican administration will protect the american technological edge. it will do so by expanding investment in defense modernization, ensuring that the defense department has a key role in approving exports of militarily critical technology, and restoring the effectiveness of export control regimes. the men and women of defense as commander-in-chief, bill clinton has been out of touch with the needs of the troops under his command. bob dole has served in the military and will protect military families against inflation, restore appropriate funding levels for billets and family housing, and ensure an environment where promotions and awards are made on the basis of military merit. a republican president who has been on active duty will not casually disrupt military family life by sending troops on non-military missions around the world. we have a solemn obligation to those who fight for america. our military personnel should not be denied a cost of living increase, as bill clinton proposed in his first year in office. a republican president will ensure a high priority for the quality of life of our military personnel and their families. we will maintain the all-volunteer force and will resist attempts to bring back the draft, whether directly or through democrat schemes for compulsory national service. we will maintain our armed forces as a meritocracy, a model for the rest of our society, without special preferences or double standards for any group. we salute the men and women of the national guard and reserve, citizen soldiers who have been - and must continue to be - a tradition in america. they perform important military functions as an integral part of our warfighting capability, and provide a critical link between our national security efforts and every community in the country. our national guard and reserve forces must not be treated as an afterthought. we oppose bill clinton's assault on the culture and traditions of the armed forces, especially his attempt to lift the ban on homosexuals in the military. we affirm that homosexuality is incompatible with military service. we support the advancement of women in the military. we reaffirm our support for the exemption of women from ground combat units and are concerned about the current policy of involuntarily assigning women to combat or near-combat units. a republican president will continue to reevaluate and revise, as necessary, current policies in light of evidence with regard to the effect on military morale, discipline, and overall readiness. we will not tolerate sexual harassment or misconduct toward anyone in the uniform, but we oppose politically motivated witch-hunts that smear the innocent and destroy honorable careers. to promote the dignity of all members of the armed forces and their families, we endorse the efforts of congressional republicans to halt the sale, in military facilities, of pornographic materials. we deplore bill clinton's shameless attempt to use protections afforded active duty military personnel under the soldiers' and sailors' civil relief act of to protect himself from a sexual harassment lawsuit. we will amend the soldiers' and sailors' civil relief act of to make clear that its protection against civil suits while on active duty does not extend to the occupant of the oval office. the republican party has always been the advocate of the nation's veterans and remains unequivocally committed to the faithful fulfillment of america's obligations to them. we have no greater duty than providing for the courageous men and women who have risked their lives in defense of our country, a major reason why we defeated bill clinton's plan to replace veterans' health care with socialized medicine. we will continue to meet the nation's promises to those who make the military their career. that is why republicans proposed and created a separate department of veterans affairs, support veterans' preference in federal employment education and retraining programs, and pledge sufficient funding for veterans' hospitals, medical care, and employment programs. intelligence the intelligence community should be our first line of defense against terrorism, drug trafficking, nuclear proliferation, and foreign espionage. bill clinton's neglect of our country's intelligence service is one of his most serious sins of omission. he has underfunded, misutilized, and marginalized critical intelligence missions and capabilities. no wonder his first appointee as director of central intelligence has endorsed bob dole. the nation's security - and the personal safety of our citizens - cannot be placed at risk. effective intelligence can be expensive. but what it costs is measured in dollars rather than lives - an important lesson of the gulf war. a republican administration will reverse the decline in funding for intelligence personnel and operations while better managing the development of futuristic capabilities. we will not constrain u.s. intelligence personnel with ""politically correct"" standards that impede their ability to collect and act on intelligence information. we will conduct whatever intelligence operations are necessary to safeguard american lives against the terrorists who bomb our airplanes and buildings. space the republican party led america into space and remains committed to its exploration and mastery. we consider space travel and space science a national priority with virtually unlimited benefits, in areas ranging from medicine to micro-machinery, for those on earth. development of space will give us a growing economic resource and a source of new scientific discoveries. we look toward our country's return to the moon and to completion of the international space station, not just as a unique orbiting laboratory but also a framework for world cooperation in pursuit of expanding human knowledge. those and other ventures require leadership now lacking at the white house. the democrat party approaches space issues with a confined vision and misplaced appropriations, encouraging inefficient investments and pork barrel spending. bill clinton gives lip service to our space program but denies it crucial resources. a republican president and a republican congress will work together to make space an american frontier again. we will develop the reusable launch vehicle, promote markets for commercial space launch services, and push technology to its creative limits. commercial space development holds the key to expanding our aerospace industry and strengthening our technology base, but it can be promoted only by removing unnecessary and artificial regulatory, legal, and tax barriers. space exploration and exploitation are a matter of national security. our armed forces already rely on space assets to support their operations on earth, and space technology will rapidly become more critical to successful military operations. space is the ocean of tomorrow, and we cannot allow its domination by another power. we must ensure that america can work and prosper there, securely and without outside influence. a new republican team will secure the high frontier for peace on earth and for unlimited human opportunity. the goal is freedom america stands on the brink of a new century. after victory in the ""long twilight struggle"" against soviet communism, americans can feel justifiably proud of the role they played in defeating history's most corrupt and predatory empire. the end of the cold war has not spelled the end of history, but it has instead unleashed forces contained for nearly fifty years of superpower confrontation. today america faces new challenges and new threats to our vital interests which can only be protected by our continued engagement in the world. our nation must resist the temptation to turn inward and neglect the exercise of american leadership and our proper role in the world. will the 21st century confer new opportunities and new benefits on america, or will it prove to be an era of weakness and decline? this will depend on whether we have a strong, decisive leader like bob dole who will protect americans at home and abroad and vigorously pursue the nation's interests around the globe. the u.s. constitution, the finest document for human governance ever devised, establishes the mission of providing for the common defense as a chief purpose of the federal government, in order to secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity. the president's primary constitutional duty and most sacred responsibility is the role of commander-in-chief. above all else, he must be able to ensure that the american people and our interests are defended. that requires strong, combat ready military forces and a sound foreign policy. if the president fails in this office, then america's freedom, independence, and prosperity will be jeopardized, and all other issues - domestic and economic - become moot. the bravery, skill, and sacrifice of america's fighting forces; the dedication, industry, and ingenuity of the american people; the superiority of u.s. technology; and the abundance of america's wealth and resources are sufficient to overcome any foreign threat or challenge. but these gifts are cause for gratitude and humility, not complacency. and these national treasures can be used to safeguard the nation effectively in a time of volatile change only if genuine leadership, wisdom, discernment, courage, and honor are present in the commander-in-chief and in the officials he or she appoints to critical national security posts. with such a president at the helm, america will know a new birth of freedom, security, and prosperity. and this nation, and the benefits it has bestowed upon mankind throughout our history, shall not perish from the earth. conclusion as we begin a new era and a new millennium, we deem it essential to reaffirm the truths of the declaration of independence: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that government derives its just powers only from the consent of the governed. we close this platform with the wisdom of our forefathers who had the courage to set their names to the declaration of independence as they too began a new era. like them, we appeal to the supreme judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions. with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence, we pledge to each other and to the american people an unfaltering commitment to restore to america a deep respect for the values of human freedom.","['preamble', 'meet', 'nominate', 'candidate', 'pass', 'platform', 'moment', 'measureless', 'national', 'opportunity', 'new', 'century', 'beckons', 'americans', 'equal', 'challenges',

Democratic Party,1996,1990,dem_1996.csv,CSV,"Meeting America's Challenges, Protecting America's Values INTRODUCTION In 1996, America will choose the President who will lead us from the millennium which saw the birth of our nation, and into a future that has all the potential to be even greater than our magnificent past. Today's Democratic Party is ready for that future. Our vision is simple. We want an America that gives all Americans the chance to live out their dreams and achieve their God-given potential. We want an America that is still the world's strongest force for peace and freedom. And we want an America that is coming together around our enduring values, instead of drifting apart. Today's Democratic Party is determined to renew America's most basic bargain: Opportunity to every American, and responsibility from every American. And today's Democratic Party is determined to reawaken the great sense of American community. Opportunity. Responsibility. Community. These are the values that made America strong. These are the values of the Democratic Party. These are the values that must guide us into the future. Today, America is moving forward with the strong leadership it deserves. The economy is stronger, the deficit is lower, and government is smaller. Education is better, families are healthier, and our streets are safer. There is more opportunity in America, more responsibility in our homes, and more peace in the world. Today's Democratic party stands proudly on the record of the last four years. We are living in an age of enormous possibility, and we are working to make sure that all Americans can make the most of it. America is moving in the right direction. Now we must move forward, and we know the course we must follow. We need a smaller, more effective, less bureaucratic government that reflects our time-honored values. The American people do not want big government solutions and they do not want empty promises. They want a course that is reasonable, help that is realistic, and solutions that can be delivered -- a moderate, achievable, common-sense agenda that will improve people's daily lives and not increase the size of government. That is what today's Democratic Party offers: the end of the era of big government, a final rejection of the misguided call to leave our citizens to fend for themselves -- and bold leadership into the future: To meet America's challenges, protect America's values, and fulfill American dreams. OPPORTUNITY For 220 years, America has been defined by a single ideal: Opportunity for all who take the responsibility to seize it. President Andrew Jackson put it best: We believe in equal opportunity for all, and special privileges for none. The mission of the Democratic Party in 1996 is to ensure that the great American Dream of opportunity for all is within reach for all, and that it travels with us, whole and intact, as we walk together into tomorrow. Economic growth. Since Bill Clinton became President, America has seen an explosion of job growth, economic renewal, and opportunity. The American people have created 10 million new jobs. After trailing Japan for 14 years, America once again became the world's leading manufacturer of automobiles in 1994, and remained number one last year. The combined rate of inflation, unemployment, and mortgage interest rates is the lowest in three decades. Now, 3.7 million more Americans own their own home, and Americans have started a record number of new small businesses in each of the last three years. In the 12 years before President Clinton took office, Republicans in the White House allowed the deficit to spiral out of control, and ignored the economic interests of ordinary America. Bill Clinton was determined to turn things around and move America in a new direction. With his leadership, we put in place a comprehensive strategy for economic growth. We fought to put America's economic house in order so private business could prosper, because today's Democratic Party knows that the private sector is the engine of economic growth. We worked to tap the full potential of a new global economy through open and fair trade. We fought to invest in the American people so they would have the capacity to meet the demands of the new economy. And we have invested in the roads, bridges, and highways that are the lifelines of American commerce. Democrats in Congress supported this course and America is better off because they did. Republicans opposed our economic plan; America's economic growth over the last four years makes it clear that they were wrong. Our strategy is in place, and it is working. We are proud of our economic record over the last four years -- and we know that our record is a record to build on. not to rest on. We have to move forward, to make sure that every American willing to work hard has the opportunity to build a good life and share in the benefits of economic success. In the last four years we worked to get the American economy going: cutting the deficit, expanding trade, and investing in our people. In the next four years we have to make the new economy work for all Americans: balancing the budget, creating more jobs, making sure all families can count on good health care and a secure retirement, and, most of all, expanding educational opportunities so all Americans can learn the skills they need to build the best possible future. Balancing the budget. For 12 years, Republicans hid behind rosy scenarios while quadrupling the national debt. We knew this had to stop. In 1992, we promised to cut the deficit in half over four years. We did. Our 1993 economic plan cut spending by over a quarter trillion dollars in five years. The only deficit left today is interest payments on the debt run up over the 12 Republican years before fiscal responsibility returned to the White House. President Clinton is the first President to cut the deficit four years in a row since before the Civil War. Now the Democratic Party is determined to finish the job and balance the budget. President Clinton has put forward a plan to balance the budget by 2002 while living up to our commitments to our elderly and our children and maintaining strong economic growth. The Republican Congress' own economists admit the President's plan will balance the budget by 2002. It cuts hundreds of wasteful and outdated programs, but it preserves Medicare and Medicaid. it protects education and the environment, and it defends working families. The President's plan reflects America's values. The Republican plan does not. Today's Democratic Party believes we have a duty to care for our parents, so they can live their lives in dignity. That duty includes securing Medicare and Medicaid, finding savings without reducing quality or benefits, and protecting Social Security for future generations. The Republican agenda rests on massive Medicare cuts, three times bigger than the largest Medicare cuts in history, including new premium increases on seniors, and drastic changes to Medicaid that will jeopardize the health care of children and seniors. Today's Democratic Party believes that all children should have the opportunity to make the most of their own lives. We believe that schools should be run by teachers and principals, not by Washington. The Republican agenda slashes college scholarships and college loans. cuts Head Start, and cuts funds to reduce class size and improve teacher standards. Today's Democratic Party believes we have a duty to preserve God's earth and American quality of life for future generations. We are committed to reform, so that environmental protection does not trap business in a tangle of red tape. The Republican budget guts environmental protection. Today's Democratic Party believes that working people should not be taxed into poverty. The Republican budget raises taxes on millions of working families. Today's Democratic Party believes that America must put our families first. The Republican budget takes Big Bird away from 5-year-olds, school lunches away from 10-year- olds. summer jobs away from 15-year-olds, and college loans away from 20-year-olds. Tax relief for working families and small businesses. President Clinton and Democrats in Congress expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit. cutting taxes to help 40 million Americans in 15 million working families -- without a single Republican vote. The Dole Gingrich budget was designed to give a massive tax break to the wealthiest Americans, and pay for it by raising taxes on ordinary Americans and slashing health care for the elderly. America cannot afford to return to the era of something-for-nothing tax cuts and smoke and-mirrors accounting that produced a decade of exploding deficits. Today's Democratic Party is committed to targeted tax cuts that help working Americans invest in their future, and we insist that any tax cuts are completely paid for, because we are determined to balance the budget. We want to strengthen middle-class families by providing a $500 tax cut for children. We want to cut taxes to help families pay for education after high school and to guarantee the first two years of college. We want people to be able to use their IRA's to buy a first home, deal with a medical emergency, or provide for education. We want to cut taxes for small businesses that invest in the future and set up pensions for their workers. And we want to cut taxes for people who are self employed and self-insured so their health care is more affordable. Technology. We know investments in technology drive economic growth, generate new knowledge, create new high-wage jobs, build new industries, and improve our quality of life. In the face of Republican efforts to undermine America's dedication to innovation, President Clinton and the Democratic Party have fought to maintain vital investments in science and technology. We remember that government investment in technology is responsible for the computer, for jet aircraft, and for the Internet -- no investments have ever paid off better, in jobs, in opportunity, or in growth. We support government policies that encourage private sector investment and innovation to create a pro-growth economic climate, like a permanent research and development tax credit. We want technology to create jobs and improve the quality of life for American workers. President Clinton and Vice President Gore fought for and, the President signed, a sweeping telecommunications reform bill that will unleash the creative power of the information industry to create millions of high-wage American jobs. As we enter the 21st century, we will continue to invest in world-class research and development, advanced technologies in transportation, information. and other industries, and agricultural and environmental research in partnership with American business. We are working to reinvent the national laboratories and revitalize America's space program. Creating jobs through trade. We believe that if we want the American economy to continue strong growth, we must continue to expand trade, and not retreat from the world. America's markets are open to the world, so America has a right to demand that the world's markets are open to our products. American products are the best in the world. When American workers and American companies have the chance to compete around the world, we do not take second place. In the last four years, the Clinton-Gore Administration has signed over 200 trade agreements, including NAFTA and GATT, to open markets around the world to American products. and create more jobs for the people who make them here at home. We have put in place the most sweeping agreements to lower foreign trade barriers of any administration in modem American history, including over 20 such agreements with Japan alone -- and American exports to Japan in the sectors covered by those agreements have increased by 85 percent. All . over the world, barriers to American products have come down, exports are at an all time high -- and we have created over one million high-paying export-related jobs. In the next four years, we must continue to work to lower foreign trade barriers; insist that foreign companies play by fair rules at home and abroad; strengthen rules that protect the global economy from fraud and dangerous instability; advance American commercial interests abroad: and ensure that the new global economy is directly beneficial to American working families. As we work to open new markets, we must continue to guarantee that all trade agreements include standards to protect children, workers, and the environment. We must ensure adequate trade adjustment assistance and education and training programs to help working families compete and win in the global economy. Education. Today's Democratic Party knows that education is the key to opportunity. In the new global economy, it is more important than ever before. Today, education is the fault line that separates those who will prosper from those who cannot. President Clinton and Democrats in Congress have spared no effort over the last four years to improve the quality of American education and expand the opportunity for all Americans to get the education they need to succeed. Every step of the way, we have been opposed by Republicans intent on cutting education. Now, they want to cut education from Head Start through college scholarships. They want to make borrowing for college more difficult for millions of students. Today's Democratic Party will stand firmly against the Republican assault on education. Cutting education as we move into the 21st century would be like cutting defense spending at the height of the Cold War. We must do more to expand educational opportunity -- not less. Strengthening public schools. We increased Head Start funding to expand early education for more children who need it. We passed Goals 2000 to help schools set high standards, and find the resources they need to succeed: the best books, the brightest teachers, the most up-to- date technology. We restructured federal education programs and eliminated federal regulations to give local schools. teachers, and principals the flexibility and help they need to meet those standards. We've worked to make sure our children have the best teachers by expanding teacher education. We applaud the work of state and local Democrats to develop innovative solutions to make sure our children get the best possible education. In the next four years, we must do even more to make sure America has the best public schools on earth. If we want to be the best, we should expect the best: We must hold students, teachers. and schools to the highest standards. Students should be required to demonstrate competency and achievement for promotion or graduation. Teachers should be required to meet high standards for performance and be rewarded for the good jobs they do -- and there should be a fair, timely, cost effective process to remove those who do not measure up. And we should get rid of the barriers that discourage talented young people from becoming teachers in the first place. We should not bash teachers. We should applaud them, and find ways to keep the best teachers in the classroom. Schools should be held accountable for results. We should redesign or shut down schools that fail. We should expand public school choice, but we should not take American tax dollars from public schools and give them to private schools. We should promote public charter schools that are held to the highest standards of accountability and access. And we should continue to ensure that America provides good education to children with disabilities, because high-quality public education is the key to opportunity for all American children. Teaching values in schools. Today's Democratic Party knows our children's education is not complete unless they learn good values. We applaud the efforts of the Clinton-Gore Administration to promote character education in our schools. Teaching good values, strong character. and the responsibilities of citizenship must be an essential part of American education. Safe schools and healthy students. If young people do not have the freedom to learn in safety, they do not have the freedom to learn at all. Over the last four years, we have worked hard to keep schools safe and drug-free, and students healthy. When Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich led Republican efforts to cut school safety funding, President Clinton and Democrats in Congress wouldn't let them get away with it. When Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich led Republican efforts to destroy the nation's school lunch program, President Clinton and Democrats in Congress stopped them cold. Now, we must launch a major rebuilding effort to make sure our children go to school in high-quality facilities where they can learn. We must help schools set the highest standards for good behavior and discipline in the classroom. Children cannot learn -- and teachers cannot teach -- without order in the classroom. Technology in the classroom. We must bring the 21st century into every classroom in America. There is a vast realm of knowledge waiting for our children to tap into. Computers are powerful tools to teach students to read better, write better, and understand math. President Clinton and Vice President Gore understand that technological literacy is essential to success in the new economy. The only way to achieve that for every student is to give them all access to a computer, good software, trained teachers, and the Internet -- and President Clinton and Vice President Gore have launched a partnership with high-tech companies, schools, state, and local governments to wire every classroom and library to the Information Superhighway by the year 2000. Preparing students for jobs. We passed School-to-Work so young people can learn the skills they need to get and keep high wage jobs. The Republican Congress is trying to destroy it, and we pledge to stop them. We want to keep working with the private sector, to encourage community partnerships that build the bridge between a good education and a good job. Higher education for all Americans. Finally, we must make sure that every American has the opportunity to go to college. Higher education is the key to a successful future in the 21st century. The typical worker with a college education earns 73 percent more than one without. America has the best higher education in the world. We do not need to change it -- we need to make it available for all Americans. Our goal must be nothing less than to make the 13th and 14th years of education as universal as the first 12. Over the last four years, the Democratic Party under President Clinton has put an unprecedented college opportunity strategy in place: We reformed the student loan program, to make college more affordable for 5.5 million students -- and we saved money for the taxpayers by eliminating the middleman, cutting red tape, and cutting the cost of student loan defaults in half. We have expanded Pell Grant college scholarships for deserving students. And the President's national service program has already helped 45,000 Americans earn money for college by helping their communities. Tax cuts for college. Over the next four years, we want to go even further: We should expand work-study so one million students a year can work their way through college by the year 2000. We should let people use money from their IRA to help pay for college. We should give a $1000 honor scholarship for the top 5 percent of graduates in every high school. And we must make 14 years of education the standard for every American. The Democratic Party wants to create a $10,000 tax deduction for families to help pay for education after high school. And we want to create a $1,500 tax cut for Americans, modeled after Georgia's successful HOPE scholarships, to guarantee the first year of tuition at a typical community college, and the second year if individuals earn it by maintaining a B average. No tax cut will do more to raise American incomes than a tax cut to pay for college. Economic security for American families in the 21st century. In the old economy, most workers could count on one job for life. They knew that hard work was rewarded with raises and steady jobs; they were confident the company would take care of them, their families, their health, and their retirement. Success was tied to the success of their employer: sacrifice when times were tough and a share in the wealth when times were good. In the new economy, the rules have changed. We need to find new ways to help working families find economic security: better training to help workers learn skills to get new and better jobs; the security of good health care and safe pensions so they can take care of themselves and their families. This is a challenge that American workers and managers are ready to face, and the Democratic Party will continue to tackle. Rewarding work. We honor work in America. Americans work hard, and they have a right to expect that work will pay. We want to continue reversing the trend of the eighties, so all Americans benefit from continued economic growth and rising wages. President Clinton and Congressional Democrats fought for and won the largest expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit in history, a tax cut for 15 million working families, because no parent who takes the responsibility to work full time should have to raise children in poverty. The President and Democrats in Congress are fighting -- against fierce Republican opposition, led by Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich -- to raise the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour, because the minimum wage should be a wage you can live on. We want to strengthen families, and we challenge the private sector to help their workers earn enough to support a family. Health care. The Democratic Party is committed to ensuring that Americans have access to affordable high-quality health care. We have expanded the Women, Infants, and Children and children will have access to the health and nutrition services they need. We established a comprehensive effort to immunize children, after defeating Republican opposition led by Senator Dole. Last year, the percentage of two-year-olds in America who were fully immunized reached an historic high. The Clinton-Gore Administration has dramatically shortened the approval process for new lifesaving drugs at the Food and Drug Administration and will continue to work to streamline the process further; we have paid special attention to women's health issues, including a 65 percent increase for breast cancer research; and we have made AIDS research, prevention, and treatment a top priority, increasing funding by almost 40 percent, including more than doubling the Ryan White Care Act to help care for people with AIDS. We are committed to finding a cure for breast cancer and AIDS, and doing more to help all Americans live longer, healthier lives. The Democratic Party is proud that we held the line against the Republicans' mean- spirited Medicare and Medicaid cuts that would risk the health care of millions of Americans, from infants to seniors. Senator Dole voted against Medicare when it was first created, and now Republican leaders want Medicare to ""wither on the vine."" The Dole-Gingrich Medicare plan would put millions of our parents into a second class health care system for the first time in their lives, and we will not stand for it. The Dole-Gingrich Medicaid plan would end the guarantee to meaningful health benefits for millions of children, older Americans, and people with disabilities. The Democratic Party wants America to preserve and strengthen Medicare and Medicaid, so we honor our values and protect the health of our children, parents, and grandparents, ensuring they can get the health care they need, from doctors' visits to long-term care. In 1993-- without a single Republican vote -- President Clinton and Democrats in Congress extended the Medicare Trust Fund into the 21st century. We have given 12 states more flexibility to run their Medicaid programs more efficiently and expand coverage, while maintaining the guarantee of meaningful benefits. When these plans are implemented, two million more Americans will have health insurance because of them. We have given Medicare beneficiaries more health plan choices and increased benefits. We have cracked down on health care waste, fraud, and abuse, saving more than $15 billion in three years. Now we must finish the job -- we can balance the budget while we preserve and strengthen Medicare and Medicaid, protecting millions of middle class families from being overwhelmed by health care costs for their parents. children, or family members with disabilities. We must move forward to reform our health care system to stop insurance companies from denying coverage to families where one member has a preexisting condition, and we must make sure that people can take their health insurance with them when they change jobs. No more Americans should have to turn down a better job because they would lose their health care if they took it. As we take steps to ensure that Americans have access to quality, affordable health care, we should start by making sure that people get help paying premiums so they do not lose health care while they're looking for a new job. We support expanded coverage of home care, hospice, and community-based services, so the elderly and people with disabilities of all ages can live in their own communities and as independently as possible. Retirement. Over the last four years, President Clinton took strong steps to protect the pensions of more than 40 million workers and retirees by fixing the federal pension insurance system and demanding that companies fund their retirement plans fully. We established a nationwide retirement protection program to protect workers' 401K retirement savings from fraud and abuse. We recognize the unique concerns of women when it comes to preparing for retirement and have worked to protect women's pension rights. Over the next four years, we want to take further steps to make sure that Americans who have worked hard for their whole lives can enjoy retirement in the dignity and security they have earned. We want to make sure people can carry their pensions with them when they change jobs, protect pensions even further, and expand the number of workers with pension coverage. Democrats created Social Security, we oppose efforts to dismantle it, and we will fight to save it. We must ensure that it is on firm financial footing well into the next century. We call on Republicans to put politics aside and join us in a serious bipartisan effort to make sure that Social Security will continue to provide true security for future generations, as it has done for millions of older Americans for decades. Training. We must do more to make sure all Americans have the skills they need to compete. We want a G.I. Bill for Workers to transform the confusing tangle of federal training programs into a simple job-training skill grant that will go directly to unemployed workers so they will be able to get the training that is right for them. We want to strengthen training opportunities for people with disabilities, so they can learn the skills they need to live independent, productive lives. Standing up for working Americans. We nearly doubled funding for the dislocated worker program and launched special projects to help workers displaced by base closures, natural disasters. and mass layoffs. We are reforming OSHA so it can do a better job to protect worker safety with less red tape, and we continue to oppose Republican efforts to gut it. We beat back efforts to undermine workers' rights to form and join unions and to dismantle the enforcement powers of the National Labor Relations Board. We vigorously oppose Republican efforts to pass Right-to-Work legislation, and to undermine collective bargaining through the TEAM Act. We are working to eradicate sweatshops in the U.S. apparel industry by stepping up enforcement and public education. We oppose the hiring of permanent workers to replace lawful economic strikers; we support the President's action to stop the government from procuring goods and services from companies that do so; and we support legislation to prohibit the permanent replacement of lawfully striking workers. We believe in equal pay for equal work and pay equity. Promoting economic growth and opportunity for all Americans. We know that it is good for America when small, minority, and women-owned businesses have the opportunity to grow and prosper. These business-owners create new jobs, expand opportunities, and serve as powerful role models for young people. Over the last four years, the President has transformed Small Business Administration to eliminate burdensome paperwork and deliver real assistance to entrepreneurs as they work to start or expand their businesses. At the same time, since Bill Clinton became President, we have more than doubled the number of loans to small businesses. from 27,000 in 1992 to 57,000 in 1995, including a 300 percent increase in loans to women-owned businesses and a nearly 200 percent increase in loans to minority businesses. The President ordered all federal agencies to comply with laws designed to ensure that small, minority, and women-owned businesses can compete for their fair share of procurement dollars. Corporate citizenship. Employers have a responsibility to do their part as well. President Clinton and the Democratic Party stand on the side of working families. We believe that values like loyalty. fairness, and responsibility are not inconsistent with the bottom line. We call on our corporate leaders to invest in the long-term, by providing workers with good wages and benefits, education and training, and opportunities for greater involvement in company decision making. As workers increase their productivity, employers should make sure they share in the benefits of the good years, as well as the burdens of the bad ones. Employers should respect the commitment of workers to their families, and should work to provide good pensions and health care. When CEOs put their workers and long-term success ahead of short-term gain, their workers will do better and so will they. RESPONSIBILITY Today's Democratic Party knows that the era of big government is over. Big bureaucracies and Washington solutions do not have the real answers to today's challenges. We need a smaller government . . . and we must have a larger national spirit. Government's job should be to give people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives. Americans must take the responsibility to use them, to build good lives for themselves and their families. Personal responsibility is the most powerful force we have to meet our challenges and shape the future we want for ourselves, for our children, and for America. Fighting crime. Today's Democratic Party believes the first responsibility of government is law and order. Four years ago, crime in America seemed intractable. The violent crime rate and the murder rate had climbed for seven straight years. Drugs seemed to flow freely across our borders and into our neighborhoods. Convicted felons could walk into any gun shop in the country and buy a handgun. Military-style assault weapons were sold freely. Our people didn't feel safe in their homes, walking their streets, or even sending their children to school. under the thumb of special interests like the gun lobby, Republicans talked tough about crime but did nothing to fight it. Bill Clinton promised to turn things around, and that is exactly what he did. After a long hard fight. President Clinton beat back fierce Republican opposition, led by Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich. to answer the call of America's police officers and pass the toughest Crime Bill in history. The Democratic Party under President Clinton is putting more police on the streets and tougher penalties on the books; we are taking guns off the streets and working to steer young people away from crime and gangs and drugs in the first place. And it is making a difference. In city after city and town after town, crime rates are finally coming down. Community policing. Nothing is more effective in the fight against crime than police officers on the beat, engaged in community policing. The Crime Bill is putting 100,000 new police officers on the street. We deplore cynical Republican attempts to undermine our promise to America to put 100,000 new police officers on the street. We pledge to stand up for our communities and stand with our police officers by opposing any attempt to repeal or weaken this effort. But we know that community policing only works when the community works with the police. We echo the President's challenge to Americans: If 50 citizens joined each of America's 20.000 neighborhood watch groups, we would have a citizen force of one million strong to give our police forces the backup they need. Protecting our children, our neighborhoods, and our police from criminals with guns. Bob Dole, Newt Gingrich, and George Bush were able to hold the Brady Bill hostage for the gun lobby until Bill Clinton became President. With his leadership, we made the Brady Bill the law of the land. And because we did, more than 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers have been stopped from buying guns. President Clinton led the fight to ban 19 deadly assault weapons, designed for one purpose only -- to kill human beings. We oppose efforts to restrict weapons used for legitimate sporting purposes, and we are proud that not one hunter or sportsman was forced to change guns because of the assault weapons ban. But we know that the military-style guns we banned have no place on America's streets, and we are proud of the courageous Democrats who defied the gun lobby and sacrificed their seats in Congress to make America safer. Today's Democratic Party stands with America's police officers. We are proud to tell them that as long as Bill Clinton and Al Gore are in the White House, any attempt to repeal the Brady Bill or assault weapons ban will be met with a veto. We must do everything we can to stand behind our police officers, and the first thing we should do is pass a ban on cop-killer bullets. Any bullet that can rip through a bulletproof vest should be against the law; that is the least we can do to protect the brave police officers who risk their lives to protect us. Tough punishment. We believe that people who break the law should be punished, and people who commit violent crimes should be punished severely. President Clinton made three- strikes you're-out the law of the land, to ensure that the most dangerous criminals go to jail for life, with no chance of parole, and signed a law to limit appeals. We established the death penalty for nearly 60 violent crimes, including murder of a law enforcement officer. We provided almost $8 billion in new funding to help states build new prison cells so violent offenders serve their full sentences. We call on the states to meet the President's challenge and guarantee that serious violent criminals serve at least 85 percent of their sentence. The American people deserve a criminal justice system in which criminals are caught, the guilty are convicted, and the convicted serve their time. Fighting youth crime and violence. Nothing we do to fight crime is more important than fighting the crime and violence that threatens our children. We have to protect them from criminals who prey on them -- and we have to teach them good values and give them something to say yes to, so they stay away from crime and trouble in the first place. The Democratic Party understands what the police have been saying for years: The best way to fight crime is to prevent it. That is why we fought for drug-education and gang prevention programs in our schools. We support well thought out, well organized, highly supervised youth programs to provide young people with a safe and healthy alternative to hanging out on the streets. We made it a federal crime for any person under the age of 18 to carry a handgun except when supervised by an adult. Democrats fought to pass, and President Clinton ordered states to impose, zero tolerance for guns in school, requiring schools to expel for one year any student who brings a gun to school. At the same time, when young people cross the line, they must be punished. When young people commit serious violent crimes, they should be prosecuted like adults. We established boot camps for young non-violent offenders. If Senator Dole and the Republicans are serious about fighting juvenile crime, they should listen to America's police officers and support the steps Democrats have taken, because they are making a difference, and then they should join us as we work to do more. We want parents to bring order to their children's lives and teach them right from wrong, and we want to make it easier for them to take that responsibility. We support schools that adopt school uniform policies, to promote discipline and respect. We support community-based curfews to keep kids off the street after a certain time, so they're safe from harm and away from trouble. We urge schools and communities to enforce truancy laws: Young people belong in school, not on the street. We also know that we must do everything we can to help families protect their children, especially from dangerous criminals who have made a dark habit of preying on young people. Study after study shows that sex offenders are likely to repeat their crimes again and again. Under President Clinton, we have taken strong steps to help keep children safe. We required every state in the country to compile a registry of sex offenders. The President signed Megan's Law to require that states tell a community whenever a dangerous sexual predator enters its midst. We support the President's directive to the Attorney General, calling on her to work with the states and Congress to develop a national sex offender registry. This will ensure that police officers in every state can get the information they need from any state to track sex offenders down and bring them to justice when they commit new crimes. Battling illegal drugs. We must keep drugs off our streets and out of our schools. President Clinton and the Democratic Party have waged an aggressive war on drugs. The Crime Bill established the death penalty for drug kingpins. The President signed a directive requiring drug testing of anyone arrested for a federal crime, and he challenged states to do the same for state offenders. We established innovative drug courts which force drug users to get treatment or go to jail. We stood firm against Republican efforts to gut the Safe and Drug Free Schools effort that supports successful drug-education programs like D.A.R.E. The Clinton Administration went to the Supreme Court to support the right of schools to test athletes for drugs. The President launched Operation Safe Home to protect the law-abiding residents of public housing from violent criminals and drug dealers who use their homes as a base for illegal activities. We support the President's decision to tell those who commit crimes and peddle drugs in public housing: You will get no second chance to threaten your neighbors; it is one strike and you're out. We are making progress. Overall drug use in America is dropping; the number of Americans who use cocaine has dropped 30 percent since 1992. Unfortunately casual drug use by young people continues to climb. We must redouble our efforts against drug abuse everywhere, especially among our children. Earlier this year, the President appointed General Barry McCaffrey to lead the nation's war on drugs. General McCaffrey is implementing an aggressive four part strategy to reach young children and prevent drug use in the first place; to catch and punish drug users and dealers; to provide treatment to those who need help; and to cut drugs off at the source before they cross the border and pollute our neighborhoods. But every adult in America must take responsibility to set a good example, and to teach children that drugs are wrong, they are illegal, and they are deadly. Ending domestic violence. When it strikes, nothing is a more dangerous threat to the safety of our families than domestic violence, because it is a threat from within. Unfortunately, violence against women is no stranger to America, but a dangerous intruder we must work together to drive from our homes. We know that domestic violence is not a 'family problem"" or ""a women's problem."" It is America's problem, and we must all fight it. The Violence Against Women Act in the 1994 Crime Bill helps police officers, prosecutors, and judges to understand domestic violence. recognize it when they see it, and know how to deal with it. In February, the President launched a 24 hour, seven-day, toll-free hotline so women in trouble can find out how to get emergency help, find shelter, and report abuse to the authorities. The number is 1 800 799-SAFE. Everyone who knows it should pass it on to anyone who might need it. Every American must take the responsibility to stop this terrible scourge. As we fight it, we must remember that the victims are not to blame. This is a crime to be punished, not a secret to be concealed. We must do everything we can to make sure that the victims of violent crime are treated with the respect and the dignity they deserve. We support the President's call for a constitutional amendment to protect the rights of victims. We believe that when a plea bargain is entered in public. a criminal is sentenced, or a defendant is let out on bail, the victims ought to know about it. and have a say. A constitutional amendment is the only way to protect those rights in every courtroom in America. Immigration. Democrats remember that we are a nation of immigrants. We recognize the extraordinary contribution of immigrants to America throughout our history. We welcome legal immigrants to America. We support a legal immigration policy that is pro-family, pro work, pro responsibility, and pro-citizenship, and we deplore those who blame immigrants for a nation of laws. We cannot tolerate illegal immigration and we must stop it. For years before Bill Clinton became President, Washington talked tough but failed to act. In 1992, our borders might as well not have existed. The Southwest border was under-patrolled, and what patrols there were, were under-equipped. Drugs flowed freely. Illegal immigration was rampant. Criminal immigrants, deported after committing crimes in America, returned the very next day to commit crimes again. President Clinton is making the Southwest border a place where the law is respected and drugs and illegal immigrants are turned away. We have increased the Border Patrol by over 40 percent; in El Paso, our Border Patrol agents are so close together they can see each other. Last year alone, the Clinton Administration removed over 11,000 illegal workers from jobs across the country. Just since January of 1995, we have arrested more than 1,700 criminal aliens and prosecuted them on federal felony charges because they returned to America after having been deported. However as we work to stop illegal immigration, we call on all Americans to avoid the temptation to use this issue to divide people from each other. We deplore those who use the need to stop illegal immigration as a pretext for discrimination. And we applaud the wisdom of Republicans like Mayor Giuliani and Senator Domenici who oppose the mean-spirited and short- sighted effort of Republicans in Congress to bar the children of illegal immigrants from schools - - it is wrong and forcing children onto the streets is an invitation for them to join gangs and turn to crime. Democrats want to protect American jobs by increasing criminal and civil sanctions against employers who hire illegal workers, but Republicans continue to favor inflammatory rhetoric over real action. We will continue to enforce labor standards to protect workers in vulnerable industries. We continue to firmly oppose welfare benefits for illegal immigrants. We believe family members who sponsor immigrants into this country should take financial responsibility for them, and be held legally responsible for supporting them. Welfare reform. Today's Democratic Party knows there is no greater gap between mainstream American values and modern American government than our failed welfare system. When Bill Clinton became President, the welfare system undermined the very values -- work, family and personal responsibility -- that it should promote. The welfare system should reflect those values: we want to help people who want to help themselves and their children. Over the past four years, President Clinton -- acting alone -- has dramatically transformed the welfare system. He has freed 41 states from federal rules and regulations so they can reform their welfare systems. The Clinton Administration has granted 69 waivers -- more than twice as many waivers as granted in the Reagan-Bush years. For 75 percent of all Americans on welfare, the rules have changed for good already, and welfare is becoming what it should be: a second chance not a way of life. Welfare rolls are finally coming down -- there are 1.3 million fewer people on welfare today than there were when President Clinton took office in January 1993. The President has also taken strong executive action to make sure that the welfare system strengthens families and demands responsibility. He ordered states to require minor mothers to stay in school and turn their lives around so they can get a job and get off welfare for good. He also directed states to require mothers to help identity and find absent fathers so we can make them pay the child support they owe. He challenged all states to require teen mothers to live at home or with a responsible adult. And the President fought to make sure that poor children get health care and nutrition to meet their basic needs. Now we must finish the job, and pass national welfare reform. Unfortunately, the plan proposed by Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich was weak on work and tough on children. That is the wrong approach. We should be tough on work and demand responsibility, but we should not punish children for their parents' mistakes. A real bipartisan welfare reform plan should require that anyone on welfare who can work, goes to work. And we should provide child care and health care so parents can work. We should impose strict time limits so that no one who can work can stay on welfare forever. We should require minor mothers to live with their parents or another responsible adult. If the Republican Party puts politics aside, we can finish the job President Clinton started, and end welfare as we know it across America. Passing legislation is not enough; we should make sure people get the skills they need to get jobs, and that there are jobs for them to go to so they leave welfare and stay off. Welfare reform should put more people to work and move them into the economic mainstream, not take jobs away from working families. Child support. Nobody has the right to walk away from the responsibility to care for his or her children. If you owe child support, paying it fully and promptly is just the first step in living up to your responsibility as a parent. The Clinton Administration has made a determined effort to crack down on deadbeat parents, collecting a record $11 billion in 1995 through tough enforcement -- almost a 40 percent increase over 1992. President Clinton issued an Executive order to track down federal workers who fail to pay child support, and force them to pay. President Clinton, Congressional Democrats, and Democratic governors all know that the toughest possible child support enforcement must be a central part of any real welfare reform plan -- including the President's plan to deny drivers licenses and professional licenses to people who do not pay their child support. We must tell deadbeats: If you neglect your responsibility to your children, we will suspend your license, garnish your wages, track you down, and make you pay. Teen pregnancy. For the first time in years, the teen pregnancy rate has leveled off and begun to drop. But we all know it is still far too high. Government alone cannot solve this problem. That is why President Clinton challenged community, business, and religious leaders together to form a national campaign to keep the teen pregnancy rate going down. And he expanded support for community-based prevention programs that teach abstinence and demand responsibility. We must send the strongest possible signal to young people that it is wrong to get pregnant or father a child until they are married and ready to support that child and raise that child. We also know that half of all underage mothers were made pregnant by a man in his twenties, or even older. Statutory rape is a crime, but unfortunately the laws that protect young women from it are almost never enforced. We echo the President's call to America's prosecutors: Enforce the statutory rape laws vigorously against men who prey on underage women. Choice. The Democratic Party stands behind the right of every woman to choose, consistent with Roe V. Wade, and regardless of ability to pay. President Clinton took executive action to make sure that the right to make such decisions is protected for all Americans. Over the last four years. we have taken action to end the gag rule and ensure safety at family planning and women's health clinics. We believe it is a fundamental constitutional liberty that individual Americans -- not government -- can best take responsibility for making the most difficult and intensely personal decisions regarding reproduction. The Democratic Party is a party of inclusion. We respect the individual conscience of each American on this difficult issue, and we welcome all our members to participate at every level of our party. Our goal is to make abortion less necessary and more rare, not more difficult and more dangerous. We support contraceptive research, family planning, comprehensive family life education, and policies that support healthy childbearing. For four years in a row, we have increased support for family planning. The abortion rate is dropping. Now we must continue to support efforts to reduce unintended pregnancies, and we call on all Americans to take personal responsibility to meet this important goal. Reinventing government. The American people have a right to demand that responsibility is the order of the day in Washington. The mission of today's Democratic Party is to expand opportunity, not bureaucracy. We have worked hard over the last four years to rein in big government, slash burdensome regulations, eliminate wasteful programs, and shift problem- solving out of Washington and back to people and communities who understand their situations best. In the last four years, President Clinton, working with the National Performance Review chaired by Vice President Gore, has cut the federal government by almost 240,000 positions, making the smallest federal government in 30 years. The federal government is eliminating 16,000 pages of outdated and unnecessary regulations, has abolished 179 programs and projects. and saved taxpayers billions of dollars. The President fought for and signed unfunded mandates legislation. This stops Congress from requiring state and local governments to implement expensive policies without providing any means to pay for them, and encourages better partnerships and more balance of resources and responsibilities. After presidents since Ulysses S. Grant tried to get the line-item veto and failed, President Clinton signed landmark legislation that will give the President this powerful tool to cut pork-barrel spending from bills passed by Congress. For years. Republicans talked about making government smaller while letting it grow -- Democrats are doing it. For years, Republicans talked about cutting the deficit while letting it climb Democrats are doing it. For years, Republicans talked about shifting power back to states and communities -- Democrats are doing it. For years, Republicans talked about making government more businesslike and efficient -- Democrats are doing it. Democrats are bringing responsibility back to Washington. In the last two years, Republicans under Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich shut the federal government down in an irresponsible attempt at partisan blackmail. Democrats under President Clinton said, and America agreed: Partisan threats are no way to run a government. Nobody should ever shut down the government again. The Republican shutdown cost the taxpayers $1.4 billion. Democrats believe government should work better and cost less -- not work less and cost more. The Republican shutdown was an affront to the hardworking public servants in our cities, towns, states. and nation who devote their lives to improving life in our country. Thanks to them our streets are safer, our water is cleaner, and our nation is secure. Front-line federal workers committed to providing quality services have joined the President's efforts to make government work better for the American people. With their help, we are saving money for the taxpayers and improving services for our people. In the last four years, we have transformed the Federal Emergency Management Agency from an outdated bureaucracy into a swift and effective agent of relief for victims of earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, or other disasters. Americans with life-threatening diseases like cancer and AIDS gain access to new drugs faster, because the Food and Drug Administration has streamlined its approval process, become more flexible in certifications, and eliminated unnecessary paperwork. The Small Business Administration has eliminated half of its regulations. cut loan applications as long as 100 pages down to one, and doubled its loan volume -- all helping Americans to produce record numbers of small businesses in each of the last three years. American home buyers are saving an average of $1,000 in closing costs because the Department of Housing and Urban Development has eliminated paperwork and other unnecessary burdens. Over the next four years, the Democratic Party will continue to make responsibility the rule in Washington: cutting bureaucracy further, improving customer service, demanding better performance, holding people and agencies accountable for producing the best results, ensuring all Americans have access to high quality public services, and forging new partnerships with the private sector including small, minority, and women-owned businesses, and with state and local governments. Political reform. Today's Democratic Party knows we have a responsibility to make our democracy work better for America, by limiting the influence of special interests and expanding the influence of the American people. Special interests have too much power in the halls of government. They often operate in secret and have special privileges ordinary Americans do not even know exist. Elections have become so expensive that big money can sometimes drown out the voices of ordinary voters -- who should always speak the loudest. Shortly after Bill Clinton took office, he implemented the toughest ethics code on executive officials in history: Senior appointees are barred from lobbying their own agencies for five years after they leave, and they can never lobby for foreign governments. After years of Republican delay, Democrats passed and the President signed the Motor Voter Bill to make it easier for people to participate in our democracy and exercise their civic responsibility in the voting booth. The President led the fight to repeal the tax loophole that let lobbyists deduct the cost of their activities, and prevailed. In 1995, after a Republican filibuster, Congress finally answered the President's call to stop taking gifts, meals, and trips from lobbyists; to bring lobbyists out from dark rooms and into the bright light of public scrutiny by requiring full disclosure; and to apply to itself the laws that apply to the rest of the country. But we must take further strong action. The President and the Democratic Party support the bipartisan McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. It will limit campaign spending, curb the influence of PACs and lobbyists, and end the soft money system. Perhaps most important of all, this bill provides free TV time for candidates, so they can talk directly to citizens about real issues and real ideas. Unfortunately, Republicans in Congress will not even let this bill come up for a vote. We call on them to stop stonewalling. It is time to take the reins of democracy away from big money and put them back in the hands of the American people, where they belong. We applaud efforts by broadcasters and private citizens alike, to increase candidates' direct access to voters through free TV. Finally, we believe all Americans have a right to fair political representation -- including the citizens of the District of Columbia which deserves statehood. We recognize the existing status of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the strong economic relationship between the people of Puerto Rico and the United States. We pledge to support the right of the people of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to choose freely, and in concert with the U.S. Congress their relationship with the United States, either as an enhanced commonwealth, a state or an independent nation. SECURITY, FREEDOM, AND PEACE The firm, sustained use of American might and diplomacy helped win the greatest victory for freedom in this half of the century -- the end of the Cold War. But to meet the challenges of this new era of promise and peril, America needed leadership that was able to see the contours of the new world -- and willing to act with steadiness, strength, and flexibility in the face of change to make the most of it. President Clinton and Vice President Gore have seized the opportunities of the post Cold War era Over the past four years, their leadership has made America safer, more prosperous, and more engaged in solving the challenges of a new era. Four years ago, thousands of Russian nuclear weapons were aimed at American cities. today. not a single Russian missile points at our children, and through the START treaties, we will cut American and Russian nuclear arsenals by two-thirds from their Cold War height. Four years ago, the forces of reform in the former Soviet Union were embattled. Today, peace initiatives are helping democracy and free markets take root throughout the region, Russian troops are out of the Baltics, and democracy has triumphed in Russia's elections. Four years ago, the Middle East process had not moved beyond a set of principles, and there were no signs of peace in Northern Ireland. Today, in the Middle East we have seen real agreements toward peace, and handshakes of history, and the people of Northern Ireland have seen a cease-fire and the first negotiations among the parties. Four years ago, the North Koreans were operating a dangerous nuclear program. Today, that program is frozen, under international inspection, and slated to be dismantled. Four years ago, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -- the bulwark of Western security during the Cold War -- was losing direction and support. Today, NATO is keeping the peace in Bosnia with its Partnership for Peace allies and, as a result of American leadership, preparing to welcome new members from Central Europe. Four years ago, America stood aloof as war and genocide spread through the former Yugoslavia. Today, thanks to NATO airstrikes, American diplomacy and the deployment of troops from the U.S. and other nations, the war has stopped and Bosnia has its first real chance for a lasting peace. Four years ago, dictators ruled in Haiti, abusing human rights and leaving thousands of its citizens desperate to flee to our shores. Today, the dictators are gone, democracy has been restored, and Haiti's mass-exodus has stopped. Four years ago, South Africa was struggling under political violence associated with apartheid. Now, following the 1994 elections -- which the United States strongly supported -- there is a national unity government and South Africa is free and democratic. Four years ago, there was good reason to worry that the world was dividing into separate, isolated, regional trading blocks. Today, thanks to Clinton Administration efforts to find new markets for American products and strengthen our existing ties, America's relations with our trading parties around the world are stronger than ever. We applaud efforts like the Summit of the Americas, the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings, and, especially, the extraordinary leadership of Commerce Secretary Ron Brown on behalf of American industry and workers everywhere. Ron Brown will always be remembered with great pride and the deepest gratitude by the Democratic Party and by all Americans. The Clinton-Gore Administration's record of leadership has deterred America's adversaries and earned respect from our allies and partners. The Dole-Gingrich Congress and the Republican Party have a different approach to America's security. Too often they would force America to go it alone -- or not at all. Their shortsighted approach has cut resources for diplomacy that could strengthen our security, and reflects an inadequate understanding of the threats and opportunities of this new era. Today's Democratic Party is unwilling to surrender to the voices of retreat and indifference. We believe the only way to ensure America's security and prosperity over the long run is to continue exerting American leadership across a range of military, diplomatic, and humanitarian, challenges around the world. Led by President Clinton and Vice President Gore, today's Democratic Party has set a far reaching agenda to strengthen our security, and promote peace and freedom. Strengthening our security. The highest imperative for our security is the protection of our people, our territory, and our key interests abroad. While both parties share a commitment to strong security, there is a real difference. The Republican desire to spend more money on defense than the Pentagon requests cannot obscure their inability to recognize the challenges of a new era and build the balanced defenses we need to meet them. Today's Democratic Party is committed to strengthening our military and adapting it to new challenges; reducing the threat of weapons of mass destruction; and meeting new challenges to our security such as terrorism, international crime, and drug trafficking. Strengthening our military. Over the past four years, the Administration has undertaken the most successful restructuring of our military forces in history. Even as the size of our forces has decreased, their capabilities, readiness and qualitative edge have increased. The Administration has ensured that America is prepared to fight alongside others when we can, and alone when we must. We have defeated attempts to cut our defense budget irresponsibly. Three times in three years, President Clinton has increased our defense spending plans -- a total of almost $50 billion -- for readiness, force modernization, and quality of life improvements. We will continue our work to ensure that the men and women who wear American uniforms receive adequate pay and support, including: childcare, housing, and access to quality health care for themselves and their families. The Administration defense plan reverses the downward trend in procurement with a 40% real increase for weapons modernization by 2001. At the same time, as part of its reinventing government program, the Administration has fundamentally reformed government procurement rules in order to get the most for our money. Use Of Force. The United States must be prepared to use military force ecisively when necessary to defend our vital interests. The burdens of ollective security in a new era must be shared fairly, and we should ncourage multilateral peacekeeping through the United Nations and other nternational efforts. Preventing And Containing Conflict. American olicy must be focused on averting military threats as well as meeting them. To alt the spread of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, we must lead renewed international effort to get tough with companies that peddle nuclear nd chemical warfare technologies, strengthen the International Atomic Energy gency, and enforce strong sanctions against governments that violate nternational restraints. A Comprehensive Test Ban would strengthen our bility to stop the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries, which may be ur greatest future security threat. We must press for strong international imits on the dangerous and wasteful flow of conventional arms to troubled egions. We will encourage Congress to ratify the START II Treaty with Russia, hich will reduce nuclear stockpiles by another 25%. Repeatedly during the past four years -- from the Persian Gulf to Bosnia -- our men and women in uniform have proven they are the best trained, best equipped, best prepared fighting force in the world. The Democratic Party is committed to build on this record by fully funding the Pentagon's 5-year defense plan; undertaking a second fundamental review of our defense structure; finding new ways for our service branches to work jointly to increase our war fighting capabilities; and ensuring that our troops can dominate the battlefield of the future. We honor America's veterans; they put their lives on the line to protect our way of life and promote our values around the world. Today's Democratic Party will stand by America's duty to our veterans. President Clinton and Vice President Gore have fought hard to protect veterans' benefits; to expand disability benefits for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange; aggressively responding to veterans of the Persian Gulf War suffering from undiagnosed illnesses; promoting veterans employment; and improving and strengthening the medical system of the Veterans Administration. Reducing the threat of weapons of mass destruction. Strengthening our security also requires an aggressive effort against weapons of mass destruction -- nuclear, chemical, and biological -- and their means of delivery. From the nuclear weapons programs in Iraq and North Korea to the Sarin gas attack in the Tokyo subway, our nation has seen that this threat is clear and present. To meet it, we must seize the opportunities presented by the end of the Cold War to cut weapons of mass destruction stockpiles while working to prevent lethal weapons and materials from falling into the wrong hands. President Clinton and Vice President Gore have pursued the most far reaching arms control and non-proliferation agenda in history. They negotiated an agreement to end the targeting of Russian nuclear missiles on American cities and citizens. They secured ratification of START II which, along with START I will reduce Russian and American arsenals by two- thirds. They prevented the breakup of the Soviet Union from yielding three new nuclear weapons states, by convincing Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan to give up their nuclear weapons. They secured the indefinite and unconditional extension of the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty. They acted to freeze North Korea's nuclear program. The Democratic Party supports efforts to sign a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty this year and to bring it into force as soon as possible. We support immediate ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention -- delayed too long by the Dole Senate. We support full funding of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program to ensure that nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union do not fall into the wrong hands. We support vigilant efforts, in cooperation with the Republic of Korea, Japan, and others, to ensure North Korea fully abides by its agreements to dismantle its nuclear program, and we support the Administration's vigorous efforts to prevent Iraq, Iran, and other dangerous states from acquiring or developing weapons of mass destruction. The Democratic Party is committed to a strong and balanced National Missile Defense program. The Administration is spending $3 billion a year on six different systems to protect our troops in the field and our allies from short and medium range missiles. To prepare for the possibility of a long range missile attack on American soil by a rogue state, the Clinton Administration is committed to developing by the year 2000 a defensive system that could be deployed by 2003, well before the threat becomes real. The Democratic Party opposes the Republican NMD plan - spending up to $60 billion on a revival of the Star Wars program that would force us to choose a costly system today that could be obsolete tomorrow. The Republican plan would waste money, weaken America's defenses and violate existing arms control agreements that make us more secure. It is the wrong way to defend America. Meeting new challenges. Today's Democratic Party knows that stronger security requires vigorous efforts to address the new dangers of this era. Chief among these are the interwoven threats of terrorism, drug trafficking, and international crime. We have seen the terrible toll they have exacted -- the murder of American soldiers in their barracks in Saudi Arabia and of innocent civilians on buses in Israel; corruption and crime from the former Soviet Union to Latin America. We know these vicious criminals pay no heed to borders; we have seen flrsthand the awful, evil work of the forces of terror at the World Trade Center and in Oklahoma City. And we know all too well the havoc drugs wreak when they cross our borders and flow through our neighborhoods. The Clinton-Gore Administration has mounted the most aggressive effort in American history to combat terrorism, drug trafficking, and international crime. We captured and convicted the perpetrators of the World Trade Center bombing. We enacted a strong new anti- terrorism law, in spite of foot dragging by the Republican Congress. We convened an historic summit of Mideast leaders at Sharm el-Sheik to coordinate anti-terrorism efforts, and made anti- terrorism a centerpiece of the 1996 G-7 summit. We imposed or maintained strong sanctions against states that sponsor terrorism, including Iran, Iraq, Libya, and Sudan, and made clear to Syria that normal relations depend on concrete steps to end its support for groups involved with terrorism. We opposed irresponsible cuts to U.S. intelligence programs and supported efforts to reorganize and strengthen the full range of intelligence agencies and programs. We opened FBI centers to provide anti-crime and anti-terrorism training. We made Colombia ineligible for most American assistance after that country's leadership failed to cooperate with American anti- narcotics efforts. Today's Democratic Party is determined to keep the war on global terrorism, narcotics, and crime at the center of our security agenda. We will seek increased cooperation from our allies and friends abroad in fighting these threats. We will continue to work aggressively to shut off foreign drug flows, eradicate foreign drug crops, and assist countries that demonstrate active cooperation. Promoting peace and democracy. Today's Democratic Party knows that peace and democracy are products of decisive strength and active diplomacy. That diplomacy must protect our interests while also projecting our values. The Republican Party too often has neglected diplomatic opportunities, slashed the budgets necessary for diplomatic successes, and overlooked the importance to our own security of democracy and human rights abroad. At its core, the Republican Party is locked in a Cold War mentality, and lacks a coherent strategy to nurture and strengthen the global progress toward peace and democracy. The Democratic Party believes a key to strengthening peace is stable and peaceful relations among the world's major powers. That has been the driving force behind much of the Clinton-Gore Administration's work, from its peace initiative in Bosnia to new security agreements with Japan. We are committed to promoting democracy in regions and countries important to America's security, and to standing with all those willing to take risks for peace, from the Middle East to Northern Ireland. And we are committed to doing it with all the tools we have: with diplomacy where possible, with force where necessary, and working with others where appropriate --our allies, willing partners, the U.N. and other security organizations -- to share the risks and costs of our leadership. Europe and the former Soviet Union. Today's Democratic Party knows that the security of Europe remains a vital American interest. We applaud the Clinton-Gore Administration's efforts to foster a peaceful, democratic and undivided Europe -- including expanded support for reform in former communist states; dramatically increased assistance to Ukraine; the Partnership for Peace program of military cooperation with Europe's new democracies; its steady, determined work to add new Central European members to NATO in the near future; and its efforts to resolve regional disputes such as between Greece and Turkey. We support continued efforts to secure a just and lasting peace in Bosnia, Northern Ireland and Cyprus. We are committed to the success of independence in Ukraine and the Baltics. And we support the continuing evolution of a prosperous and peaceful Russia. And as part of our effort to support we will pursue a relationship in which we seek cooperation when we can, and frankly express disagreements where they exist, such as on Chechnya. Asia. We know that many of America's most pressing security challenges and most promising commercial opportunities lie in the Asia Pacific region. The Democratic Party applauds the important new security charter with Japan, the Administration's close cooperation with the Republic of Korea toward the goal of a unified and non-nuclear peninsula, and the deployment of an American naval task force to the Taiwan Straits to ensure that China's military exercises did not imperil the security of the region. The Party supports the Administration's policy of steady engagement to encourage a stable, open and prosperous China-- a China that respects human rights throughout its land and in Tibet, that joins international efforts against weapons proliferation, and that plays by the rules of free and fair trade. Today's Democratic Party strongly supports continued American troop presence in East Asia and efforts to promote increased regional security. And we are committed to building long-term relationships with India. Pakistan, and others in South Asia in order to advance America's diverse interests in that region, from democracy and commerce to nuclear non-proliferation. The Middle East. President Clinton has overseen a remarkable record of achievement toward peace and security in the Middle East -- the Israeli-Palestinian accords; the peace agreement between Israel and Jordan; new regional security and investment summits; Israel's increased acceptance throughout the Middle East and the world; the dual containment of Iraq and Iran. The Democratic Party is committed to help build on this record, knowing that peace and security are indivisible. The Democratic Party remains committed to America's long-standing special relationship with Israel, based on shared values, a mutual commitment to democracy and a strategic alliance that benefits both nations. The United States should continue to help Israel maintain its qualitative edge so that Israel has the confidence to pursue peace. Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths. We also support close ties with states and peoples in the Arab and Islamic world committed to non- aggression and willing to take risks for peace. Latin America. The Clinton-Gore Administration forged an historic partnership with the democracies of the Western Hemisphere, as reflected in the 1994 Summit of the Americas. Today. every country in the Hemisphere is a democracy except Cuba. Because democratic stability and prosperity in the countries to our south are in their interest and ours, President Clinton took bold steps to bolster Mexico's economy when it was threatened by crisis; worked to resolve internal and border conflicts in the Hemisphere; joined with regional partners to combat narcotics trafficking; and maintained a tough embargo against Cuba while reaching out to its people. The Democratic Party is committed to further consolidating democracy, stability, and open markets throughout the hemisphere. Africa. The Clinton Administration championed South Africa's democratic transition; supported Africa's many emerging democracies and led international efforts to speed the return of democracy in Nigeria; helped save countless lives in Somalia, Rwanda, and elsewhere through conflict resolution, removal of land mines, and humanitarian relief; and took steps to help sub- Saharan Africa's 700 million people develop into strong economies and markets. The Democratic Party believes that continuing to help the people of Africa nurture their continent's extraordinary potential and address its serious problems is both the right thing to do and profoundly in America's interest. Promoting democracy. America remains a beacon of hope to all who cherish democracy and human rights, and America's security benefits from the enlargement of the community of market democracies. The Clinton-Gore Administration has actively promoted the consolidation and spread of democracy and human rights: in Russia and throughout the former Soviet Union, Central Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa. President Clinton directed Vice President Gore to lead bi national efforts to establish trading relationships to help promote democracy in three strategic areas: Russia, South Africa, and Egypt. The Democratic Party supports the aspirations of all those who seek to strengthen civil society and accountable governance. To this end. we support continued funding for the National Endowment for Democracy, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the Asia Pacific Network, Radio Marti and other efforts to promote democracy and the free flow of ideas. Promoting Democracy Discussion Resources for diplomacy. There is a price to be paid for America's security and its leadership in world affairs -- and the Republican Party now refuses to pay that price. Even though less than one percent of the federal budget goes to foreign policy spending, the Republican Party has savaged our diplomatic readiness, defaulted on treaty obligations to pay dues to the United Nations, slashed assistance to the poorest and most vulnerable populations on earth, and pushed the United States to dead last among developed nations in the global fight against starvation, infant mortality, natural disasters and environmental degradation and other worldwide problems. The Democratic Party understands that these efforts strengthen our security and express our values, and strongly supports the Clinton-Gore Administration's work to ensure adequate resources for American foreign policy. COMMUNITY Across America, in far too many places, the bonds of community that tie us together and remind us that we rise or fall together, have too often frayed. Today's Democratic Party believes we must reawaken the strong sense of community that has helped America to prosper for 220 years. America is uniquely suited to lead the world into the 21st century because of our great diversity and our shared values. We must never let our differences divide us from each other; instead we must come together on a new common ground, based on the enduring values we share. When Americans work together -- in our homes, our schools, our houses of worship, our civic groups. our businesses -- we can meet any challenge, and realize every dream. Putting families first. The first and most sacred responsibility of every parent is to cherish our children and strengthen our families. The family is the foundation of American life. After 12 years of all family-values-talk and no family-values-action by the Republicans, President Clinton took office determined to put families first. We support the fundamental themes of the Families First Agenda -- promoting paycheck, health care, retirement, and personal security: creating greater educational and economic opportunity; and requiring greater responsibility from individuals, businesses, and government. Standing up for parents. In the first month of Bill Clinton's Presidency, the Democratic Party ended eight years of Republican gridlock and enacted the Family and Medical Leave Act. Americans blessed with a new child or troubled by a family health crisis can no longer be forced to choose between their families and their jobs. A bipartisan panel reported that 12 million workers have already been able to live up to their family obligations without risking their jobs. And almost 90 percent of businesses found that complying with this law cost them little or nothing. Despite how important this is to American families, Senator Dole led Republican opposition to it and still insists it was wrong. This law is good for families, it is good for America. and it would not be the law today without the Democratic Party. Now we want to take the next step. We believe parents should be able to take unpaid leave from work and choose flex time so they can do their job as parents: to do things like go to parent-teacher conferences or take a child to the doctor. We support tax credits to encourage adoption, because every child deserves a mother and father who will love them and raise them. Responsible entertainment. President Clinton and Vice President Gore have led the fight to help parents control what their children see on television. Because of their leadership, Congress passed a law requiring all new televisions to include a device called a V-chip that will block violent programs when it is activated by an adult. Senator Dole likes to talk about TV violence, but when it came time to act, he stood with a small minority to oppose the bipartisan V-chip bill. The President achieved a breakthrough agreement with the media and entertainment industries to develop a rating system for TV shows similar to the motion picture rating system, so parents can make informed decisions about what they want their children to watch. When parents control the remote, it is not censorship, it is personal responsibility for their children's upbringing. We believe in public support for the arts, and especially for high-quality, family-friendly programming. We are proud to have stopped the Republican attack on the Corporation for Public Broadcasting -- we want our children to watch Sesame Street, not Power Rangers. And we echo the President's call to the entertainment industry: Work harder to develop and promote movies, music, and TV shows that are suitable -- and educational -- for children. Tobacco. Cigarette smoking is rapidly becoming the single greatest threat to the health of our children. We know that 3,000 young people start smoking every day, and 1,000 of them will lead shorter lives because of it. Despite that, Senator Dole and other Republicans continue to ignore volumes of medical research to make baffling claims that cigarettes are not addictive. They even argue with distinguished Republican experts like President Reagan's Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. President Clinton and Vice President Gore understand that we have a responsibility to protect our children's future by cracking down on illegal sales of tobacco to minors and by curbing sophisticated advertising campaigns designed to entice kids to start smoking before they are old enough to make an informed decision. The President has proposed measures to cut off children's access to cigarettes, crack down on those who sell tobacco to minors illegally. and curtail advertising designed to appeal to children. We believe tobacco companies should market to adults if they wish, but take the responsibility to draw the line on children. Parents responsibility. All of this is important, and we pledge to continue to fight for ways to strengthen our families. But today's Democratic Party knows that governments do not raise children, parents do. That is why President Clinton and Vice President Gore took action to order all federal agencies to make sure everything government does for children promotes responsibility from all parents, fathers as well as mothers. Now we challenge every parent to put their children first: to help them with their homework, to read to them, to know their teachers, and above all, to teach their children right from wrong and set the best example. Community empowerment. Today's Democratic Party understands that we cannot rebuild our poorest communities by imposing cookie-cutter solutions from Washington. We have to give communities the tools they need to create opportunity. Citizens, local government, the private sector, and civic groups must come together and take the responsibility to rebuild their communities from the bottom up. Encouraging private sector investment, and community-based solutions. After over a decade of sustained Republican neglect and empty Republican promises, President Clinton and Democrats in Congress launched a comprehensive strategy to unleash economic growth and restore opportunity to our distressed neighborhoods. Without a single Republican vote, we created 105 Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities. This effort, chaired by Vice President Gore, is bringing jobs and businesses to our poorest urban and rural areas. Thousands of new businesses have already moved into these areas, or expanded existing operations, bringing new hope and new jobs to these neighborhoods. We reformed the Community Reinvestment Act to shift the focus from process toward results; we implemented low income mortgage purchase requirements on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; and we created a Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. Together, these efforts are unleashing billions of dollars in new private sector lending and investment for housing and economic development in our inner cities and poorest rural areas. The President and Vice President have created a brownfields initiative to bring life back to abandoned and contaminated property by reforming outdated regulations and providing incentives for cleanup. Over the next four years, we want a second round of Empowerment Zones to bring economic growth to more American communities; a significant expansion of the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund to spur more private sector investment in local economies: and a new tax incentive to encourage further cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields. Today's Democratic Party knows that the best way to bring jobs and growth back to our poorest neighborhoods is to harness the job-creating power of the private sector. Helping people afford safe, secure housing. Safe, secure housing is an essential part of strong communities and strong families. We are proud that after four years of a Democrat in the White House, the percentage of people who own their own house climbed faster than it has in 30 years. Bill Clinton took executive action to make it easier and cheaper for working and middle- class home buyers to get a home loan. We pledge to stand against Republican efforts to repeal the deductibility of home mortgage interest payments. Fulfilling his 1992 pledge, President Clinton made the low-income housing tax credit permanent, encouraging private developers to build more affordable housing. This tax credit is making it easier for families to get housing, and we will stand against Republican attacks on it. The Clinton Administration has made sweeping changes to transform the nation's public housing system after decades of neglect. In the last four years, Democrats demolished more units of unlivable public housing than Republicans did in the previous twelve years, replacing them with lower-density developments that can serve as anchors for neighborhood renewal. In the next four years, we want to transform the worst public housing from a system that traps people in rundown, crime-ridden projects into one which gives families the freedom to choose where they live by providing vouchers to help them with housing costs. We have dramatically increased help for the homeless, and shifted focus from temporary shelters toward permanent solutions designed to move people back into the mainstream, into jobs and a home of their own. Agriculture and the rural community. America has the most abundant agricultural economy on earth, and it must be preserved and strengthened as we enter a new century. President Clinton and the Democrats have worked hard to promote economic growth in rural areas, protect the family farm, and ensure that farmers get a fair return for their labor and investment and consumers can continue to count on safe and nutritious foods. In the face of Republican efforts to gut food safety, the Clinton Administration has revolutionized meat inspection and set a new standard of consumer protection. President Clinton has reinvented the Agriculture Department, reducing regulations and bureaucracy and improving service. The Clinton Administration has cracked down on food stamp fraud, and approved experiments in state after state to reform the food stamp program. President Clinton and Democrats in Congress supported new voluntary conservation programs and saved economic development programs for rural areas through the 1996 Farm Bill. We are committed to expanding agricultural exports by reducing unfair subsidies and trade barriers around the world. Protecting our environment. Today's Democratic party wants all Americans to be able to enjoy America's magnificent natural heritage -- and we want our people to know that the air they breathe is pure, the water they drink is clean, and the land they live on is safe from hazard. We understand we have a sacred obligation to protect God's earth and preserve our quality of life for our children and our children's children. For the 12 Republican years before Bill Clinton and Al Gore took office, protecting the environment was far from a priority. And in the last two years, 25 years of bipartisan environmental progress -- started by a Democratic Congress under a Republican President -- has come under attack from the far right. Time and again, President Clinton and the Democratic Party have stood firm against this onslaught. The Republican Congress, under Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich, voted to cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent. President Clinton and Democrats in Congress said no. We believe government has a responsibility to enforce the laws that help keep toxic chemicals from our water, pesticides from our food, and smog from our air. The Republican Congress, under Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich, let lobbyists for the polluters write their own loopholes into bills to weaken laws that protect the health and safety of our children. President Clinton and Democrats in Congress said no. We believe America's elected officials have a responsibility to protect America's families from threats to their health, and that trust must never be abdicated -- especially not by placing control of environmental safeguards in the hands of the very polluters those safeguards are meant to keep in line. The Republican Congress, under Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich, tried to make taxpayers pick up the tab for toxic wastes, and let polluters who caused the problem and can afford to fix it off the hook. President Clinton and Democrats in Congress said no. We believe America should insist that toxic waste cleanup is paid for by those responsible for it in the first place -- and not foisted off on the taxpayers. In the last four years, President Clinton and Vice President Gore have taken strong action to make our air and water cleaner. They reformed the Superfund program -- in each of the last two years nearly as many toxic dumps were cleaned as in the previous decade. They dramatically strengthened Community Right-to-Know efforts, because Americans should be informed about toxic chemicals being released into the air and water so they can take steps to protect themselves and their families. They took measures to cut toxic air pollution from chemical plants by 90 percent, and after years of Republican neglect they cleaned up hundreds of nuclear weapons sites and are committed to finishing the job. Today's Democratic Party knows that we can protect the environment and expand the economy. We believe we can create more jobs over the long run by cleaning the environment. We want to challenge businesses and communities to take more initiative in protecting the environment, and we want to make it easier for them to do it. President Clinton and Vice President Gore launched Project XL which tells businesses: If you can find a cheaper, more efficient way than government regulations require to meet even tougher pollution goals, do it -- as long as you do it right. This new approach offers business flexibility, incentives, and accountability. Environmental protection should include more education on compliance for small and medium sized business, more strategies to increase compliance for all businesses, and tough enforcement -- including criminal prosecution -- for those who put human health and the environment at risk. We are committed to protecting the majestic legacy of our National Parks and enhancing recreational opportunities; restoring the Florida Everglades; preserving our wildlife refuges and fighting off any effort to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. We will be good stewards of our old-growth forests, oppose new offshore oil drilling and mineral exploration and production in our nation's many environmentally critical areas, and protect our oceans from oil spills and the dumping of toxic and radioactive waste. The President and Vice President announced an historic partnership with the Big Three American automakers to develop the technology to produce cars up to three times more fuel efficient than those made today -- cleaner cars for a cleaner environment. We will continue to support responsible recycling, and encourage energy efficiency that makes our economy more efficient and less reliant on foreign oil. We believe that investments in better mass transit, cleaner cars, and renewable energy sources are good for the environment and good for the economy. After years in which Republicans neglected the global environment, the Clinton Administration has made America a leader in the fight to meet environmental challenges that transcend national borders and require global cooperation. The Clinton-Gore Administration led the world in calling for a global ban on ocean-dumping of low-level radioactive waste and for a legally binding treaty to phase out persistent organic pollutants such as DDT and PCBs. We will seek a strong international agreement to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. We are committed to preserving the planet's biodiversity, repairing the depleted ozone layer. and working with other nations to stabilize population growth. Democrats recognize that sustainable development is the key to protecting the environment and promoting economic growth. That is why the Clinton-Gore Administration has reformed our foreign aid programs to focus on sustainable development. At home, Democrats know that sound economic development means sound environmental protection. The American community. Today's Democratic Party knows that when America is divided we will likely fail, but when America is united we will always prevail. Americans will always have differences, and when we reach across those differences, we are stronger for it. And we share an abiding set of values that define us as Americans. Our task is to draw strength from both -- from our great diversity and our constant values -- to fashion the future we want for our children. Fighting discrimination and protecting civil rights. Today's Democratic Party knows we must renew our efforts to stamp out discrimination and hatred of every kind, wherever and whenever we see it. We deplore the recent wave of burnings that has targeted African-American churches in the South, as well as other houses of worship across the country, and we have established a special task force to help local communities catch and prosecute those responsible, prevent further arsons, and rebuild their churches. We must remember we do not have an American to waste. We continue to lead the fight to end discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, age, ethnicity, disability, and sexual orientation. The Democratic Party has always supported the Equal Rights Amendment, and we are committed to ensuring full equality for women. We support continued efforts, like the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, to end discrimination against gay men and lesbians and further their full inclusion in the life of the nation. Over the last four years, President Clinton and the Democrats have worked aggressively to enforce the letter and spirit of civil rights law. The President and Vice President remain committed to an Administration that looks like America, and we are proud of the Administration's extraordinary judicial appointments -- they are both more diverse and more qualified than any previous Administration. We know there is still more we can do to ensure equal opportunity for all Americans, so all people willing to work hard can build a strong future. President Clinton has led the way in reforming affirmative action so that it works, it is improved, and promotes opportunity, but does not accidentally hold others back in the process. When it comes to affirmative action, we should mend it, not end it. Religious freedom. Today's Democratic Party understands that all Americans have a right to express their faith. The Constitution prohibits the state establishment of religion, and it protects the free exercise of religion. The President fought for and signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, to reaffirm the great protection the Constitution gives to religious expression, and to recognize the historic role people of faith have played in America. Americans have a right to express their love of God in public, and we applaud the President's work to ensure that children are not denied private religious expression in school. Whenever the religious rights of our children -- or any American -- are threatened, we will stand against it. Responsibility to our community and our country. Today's Democratic Party believes every American has a duty and a responsibility to give something back to their community and their country. In the past three years, 45,000 Americans have performed national service as part of the AmeriCorps program President Clinton and the Democrats fought so hard to create -- and we commend Senator Grassley and other Republicans who joined a bipartisan effort to preserve AmeriCorps when Speaker Gingrich's House tried to kill it. We applaud the American spirit of voluntarism and charity. As we balance the budget, we must work even harder in our own lives to live up to the duties we owe one another. We must shrink the government, but we cannot shrink from our challenges. We believe every school and college in America should make service a part of its basic ethic, and we want to expand national service by helping communities give scholarships to high school students for community service. We challenge Americans in all walks of life to make a new commitment to taking responsibility for themselves, their families, their communities, and their country. If we do our job, we will make the next American century as great as each one that has come before it. We will enter the 21st century with the American Dream alive for all, with America still the world's strongest force for peace and freedom, and with the American community coming together, enriched by our diversity and stronger than ever. America's best days lie ahead, as we renew our historic pledge to uphold and advance the promise of America -- One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.",100932,16231,"meeting america's challenges, protecting america's values introduction in , america will choose the president who will lead us from the millennium which saw the birth of our

gives all americans the chance to live out their dreams and achieve their god-given potential. we want an america that is still the world's strongest force for peace and freedom. and we want an america that is coming together around our enduring values, instead of drifting apart. today's democratic party is determined to renew america's most basic bargain: opportunity to every american, and responsibility from every american. and today's democratic party is determined to reawaken the great sense of american community. opportunity. responsibility. community. these are the values that made america strong. these are the values of the democratic party. these are the values that must guide us into the future. today, america is moving forward with the strong leadership it deserves. the economy is stronger, the deficit is lower, and government is smaller. education is better, families are healthier, and our streets are safer. there is more opportunity in america, more responsibility in our homes, and more peace in the world. today's democratic party stands proudly on the record of the last four years. we are living in an age of enormous possibility, and we are working to make sure that all americans can make the most of it. america is moving in the right direction. now we must move forward, and we know the course we must follow. we need a smaller, more effective, less bureaucratic government that reflects our time-honored values. the american people do not want big government solutions and they do not want empty promises. they want a course that is reasonable, help that is realistic, and solutions that can be delivered -- a moderate, achievable, common-sense agenda that will improve people's daily lives and not increase the size of government. that is what today's democratic party offers: the end of the era of big government, a final rejection of the misguided call to leave our citizens to fend for themselves -- and bold leadership into the future: to meet america's challenges, protect america's values, and fulfill american dreams. opportunity for years, america has been defined by a single ideal: opportunity for all who take the responsibility to seize it. president andrew jackson put it best: we believe in equal opportunity for all, and special privileges for none. the mission of the democratic party in is to ensure that the great american dream of opportunity for all is within reach for all, and that it travels with us, whole and intact, as we walk together into tomorrow. economic growth. since bill clinton became president, america has seen an explosion of job growth, economic renewal, and opportunity. the american people have created million new jobs. after trailing japan for years, america once again became the world's leading manufacturer of automobiles in , and remained number one last year. the combined rate of inflation, unemployment, and mortgage interest rates is the lowest in three decades. now, . million more americans own their own home, and americans have started a record number of new small businesses in each of the last three years. in the years before president clinton took office, republicans in the white house allowed the deficit to spiral out of control, and ignored the economic interests of ordinary america. bill clinton was determined to turn things around and move america in a new direction. with his leadership, we put in place a comprehensive strategy for economic growth. we fought to put america's economic house in order so private business could prosper, because today's democratic party knows that the private sector is the engine of economic growth. we worked to tap the full potential of a new global economy through open and fair trade. we fought to invest in the american people so they would have the capacity to meet the demands of the new economy. and we have invested in the roads, bridges, and highways that are the lifelines of american commerce. democrats in congress supported this course and america is better off because they did. republicans opposed our economic plan; america's economic growth over the last four years makes it clear that they were wrong. our strategy is in place, and it is working. we are proud of our economic record over the last four years -- and we know that our record is a record to build on. not to rest on. we have to move forward, to make sure that every american willing to work hard has the opportunity to build a good life and share in the benefits of economic success. in the last four years we worked to get the american economy going: cutting the deficit, expanding trade, and investing in our people. in the next four years we have to make the new economy work for all americans: balancing the budget, creating more jobs, making sure all families can count on good health care and a secure retirement, and, most of all, expanding educational opportunities so all americans can learn the skills they need to build the best possible future. balancing the budget. for years, republicans hid behind rosy scenarios while quadrupling the national debt. we knew this had to stop. in , we promised to cut the deficit in half over four years. we did. our economic plan cut spending by over a quarter trillion dollars in five years. the only deficit left today is interest payments on the debt run up over the republican years before fiscal responsibility returned to the white house. president clinton is the first president to cut the deficit four years in a row since before the civil war. now the democratic party is determined to finish the job and balance the budget. president clinton has put forward a plan to balance the budget by while living up to our commitments to our elderly and our children and maintaining strong economic growth. the republican congress' own economists admit the president's plan will balance the budget by . it cuts hundreds of wasteful and outdated programs, but it preserves medicare and medicaid. it protects education and the environment, and it defends working families. the president's plan reflects america's values. the republican plan does not. today's democratic party believes we have a duty to care for our parents, so they can live their lives in dignity. that duty includes securing medicare and medicaid, finding savings without reducing quality or benefits, and protecting social security for future generations. the republican agenda rests on massive medicare cuts, three times bigger than the largest medicare cuts in history, including new premium increases on seniors, and drastic changes to medicaid that will jeopardize the health care of children and seniors. today's democratic party believes that all children should have the opportunity to make the most of their own lives. we believe that schools should be run by teachers and principals, not by washington. the republican agenda slashes college scholarships and college loans. cuts head start, and cuts funds to reduce class size and improve teacher standards. today's democratic party believes we have a duty to preserve god's earth and american quality of life for future generations. we are committed to reform, so that environmental protection does not trap business in a tangle of red tape. the republican budget guts environmental protection. today's democratic party believes that working people should not be taxed into poverty. the republican budget raises taxes on millions of working families. today's democratic party believes that america must put our families first. the republican budget takes big bird away from -year-olds, school lunches away from -year- olds. summer jobs away from -year-olds, and college loans away from -year-olds. tax relief for working families and small businesses. president clinton and democrats in congress expanded the earned income tax credit. cutting taxes to help million americans in million working families -- without a single republican vote. the dole gingrich budget was designed to give a massive tax break to the wealthiest americans, and pay for it by raising taxes on ordinary americans and slashing health care for the elderly. america cannot afford to return to the era of something-for-nothing tax cuts and smoke and-mirrors accounting that produced a decade of exploding deficits. today's democratic party is committed to targeted tax cuts that help working americans invest in their future, and we insist that any tax cuts are completely paid for, because we are determined to balance the budget. we want to strengthen middle-class families by providing a $ tax cut for children. we want to cut taxes to help families pay for education after high school and to guarantee the first two years of college. we want people to be able to use their ira's to buy a first home, deal with a medical emergency, or provide for education. we want to cut taxes for small businesses that invest in the future and set up pensions for their workers. and we want to cut taxes for people who are self employed and self-insured so their health care is more affordable. technology. we know investments in technology drive economic growth, generate new knowledge, create new high-wage jobs, build new industries, and improve our quality of life. in the face of republican efforts to undermine america's dedication to innovation, president clinton and the democratic party have fought to maintain vital investments in science and technology. we remember that government investment in technology is responsible for the computer, for jet aircraft, and for the internet -- no investments have ever paid off better, in jobs, in opportunity, or in growth. we support government policies that encourage private sector investment and innovation to create a pro-growth economic climate, like a permanent research and development tax credit. we want technology to create jobs and improve the quality of life for american workers. president clinton and vice president gore fought for and, the president signed, a sweeping telecommunications reform bill that will unleash the creative power of the information industry to create millions of high-wage american jobs. as we enter the 21st century, we will continue to invest in world-class research and development, advanced technologies in transportation, information. and other industries, and agricultural and environmental research in partnership with american business. we are working to reinvent the national laboratories and revitalize america's space program. creating jobs through trade. we believe that if we want the american economy to continue strong growth, we must continue to expand trade, and not retreat from the world. america's markets are open to the world, so america has a right to demand that the world's markets are open to our products. american products are the best in the world. when american workers and american companies have the chance to compete around the world, we do not take second place. in the last four years, the clinton-gore administration has signed over trade agreements, including nafta and gatt, to open markets around the world to american products. and create more jobs for the people who make them here at home. we have put in place the most sweeping agreements to lower foreign trade barriers of any administration in modem american history, including over such agreements with japan alone -- and american exports to japan in the sectors covered by those agreements have increased by percent. all . over the world, barriers to american products have come down, exports are at an all time high -- and we have created over one million high-paying export-related jobs. in the next four years, we must continue to work to lower foreign trade barriers; insist that foreign companies play by fair rules at home and abroad; strengthen rules that protect the global economy from fraud and dangerous instability; advance american commercial interests abroad: and ensure that the new global economy is directly beneficial to american working families. as we work to open new markets, we must continue to guarantee that all trade agreements include standards to protect children, workers, and the environment. we must ensure adequate trade adjustment assistance and education and training programs to help working families compete and win in the global economy. education. today's democratic party knows that education is the key to opportunity. in the new global economy, it is more important than ever before. today, education is the fault line that separates those who will prosper from those who cannot. president clinton and democrats in congress have spared no effort over the last four years to improve the quality of american education and expand the opportunity for all americans to get the education they need to succeed. every step of the way, we have been opposed by republicans intent on cutting education. now, they want to cut education from head start through college scholarships. they want to make borrowing for college more difficult for millions of students. today's democratic party will stand firmly against the republican assault on education. cutting education as we move into the 21st century would be like cutting defense spending at the height of the cold war. we must do more to expand educational opportunity -- not less. strengthening public schools. we increased head start funding to expand early education for more children who need it. we passed goals to help schools set high standards, and find the resources they need to succeed: the best books, the brightest teachers, the most up-to- date technology. we restructured federal education programs and eliminated federal regulations to give local schools. teachers, and principals the flexibility and help they need to meet those standards. we've worked to make sure our children have the best teachers by expanding teacher education. we applaud the work of state and local democrats to develop innovative solutions to make sure our children get the best possible education. in the next four years, we must do even more to make sure america has the best public schools on earth. if we want to be the best, we should expect the best: we must hold students, teachers. and schools to the highest standards. students should be required to demonstrate competency and achievement for promotion or graduation. teachers should be required to meet high standards for performance and be rewarded for the good jobs they do -- and there should be a fair, timely, cost effective process to remove those who do not measure up. and we should get rid of the barriers that discourage talented young people from becoming teachers in the first place. we should not bash teachers. we should applaud them, and find ways to keep the best teachers in the classroom. schools should be held accountable for results. we should redesign or shut down schools that fail. we should expand public school choice, but we should not take american tax dollars from public schools and give them to private schools. we should promote public charter schools that are held to the highest standards of accountability and access. and we should continue to ensure that america provides good education to children with disabilities, because high-quality public education is the key to opportunity for all american children. teaching values in schools. today's democratic party knows our children's education is not complete unless they learn good values. we applaud the efforts of the clinton-gore administration to promote character education in our schools. teaching good values, strong character. and the responsibilities of citizenship must be an essential part of american education. safe schools and healthy students. if young people do not have the freedom to learn in safety, they do not have the freedom to learn at all. over the last four years, we have worked hard to keep schools safe and drug-free, and students healthy. when senator dole and speaker gingrich led republican efforts to cut school safety funding, president clinton and democrats in congress wouldn't let them get away with it. when senator dole and speaker gingrich led republican efforts to destroy the nation's school lunch program, president clinton and democrats in congress stopped them cold. now, we must launch a major rebuilding effort to make sure our children go to school in high-quality facilities where they can learn. we must help schools set the highest standards for good behavior and discipline in the classroom. children cannot learn -- and teachers cannot teach -- without order in the classroom. technology in the classroom. we must bring the 21st century into every classroom in america. there is a vast realm of knowledge waiting for our children to tap into. computers are powerful tools to teach students to read better, write better, and understand math. president clinton and vice president gore understand that technological literacy is essential to success in the new economy. the only way to achieve that for every student is to give them all access to a computer, good software, trained teachers, and the internet -- and president clinton and vice president gore have launched a partnership with high-tech companies, schools, state, and local governments to wire every classroom and library to the information superhighway by the year . preparing students for jobs. we passed school-to-work so young people can learn the skills they need to get and keep high wage jobs. the republican congress is trying to destroy it, and we pledge to stop them. we want to keep working with the private sector, to encourage community partnerships that build the bridge between a good education and a good job. higher education for all americans. finally, we must make sure that every american has the opportunity to go to college. higher education is the key to a successful future in the 21st century. the typical worker with a college education earns percent more than one without. america has the best higher education in the world. we do not need to change it -- we need to make it available for all americans. our goal must be nothing less than to make the 13th and 14th years of education as universal as the first . over the last four years, the democratic party under president clinton has put an unprecedented college opportunity strategy in place: we reformed the student loan program, to make college more affordable for . million students -- and we saved money for the taxpayers by eliminating the middleman, cutting red tape, and cutting the cost of student loan defaults in half. we have expanded pell grant college scholarships for deserving students. and the president's national service program has already helped , americans earn money for college by helping their communities. tax cuts for college. over the next four years, we want to go even further: we should expand work-study so one million students a year can work their way through college by the year . we should let people use money from their ira to help pay for college. we should give a $ honor scholarship for the top percent of graduates in every high school. and we must make years of education the standard for every american. the democratic party wants to create a $, tax deduction for families to help pay for education after high school. and we want to create a $, tax cut for americans, modeled after georgia's successful hope scholarships, to guarantee the first year of tuition at a typical community college, and the second year if individuals earn it by maintaining a b average. no tax cut will do more to raise american incomes than a tax cut to pay for college. economic security for american families in the 21st century. in the old economy, most workers could count on one job for life. they knew that hard work was rewarded with raises and steady jobs; they were confident the company would take care of them, their families, their health, and their retirement. success was tied to the success of their employer: sacrifice when times were tough and a share in the wealth when times were good. in the new economy, the rules have changed. we need to find new ways to help working families find economic security: better training to help workers learn skills to get new and better jobs; the security of good health care and safe pensions so they can take care of themselves and their families. this is a challenge that american workers and managers are ready to face, and the democratic party will continue to tackle. rewarding work. we honor work in america. americans work hard, and they have a right to expect that work will pay. we want to continue reversing the trend of the eighties, so all americans benefit from continued economic growth and rising wages. president clinton and congressional democrats fought for and won the largest expansion of the earned income tax credit in history, a tax cut for million working families, because no parent who takes the responsibility to work full time should have to raise children in poverty. the president and democrats in congress are fighting -- against fierce republican opposition, led by senator dole and speaker gingrich -- to raise the minimum wage to $. an hour, because the minimum wage should be a wage you can live on. we want to strengthen families, and we challenge the private sector to help their workers earn enough to support a family. health care. the democratic party is committed to ensuring that americans have access to affordable high-quality health care. we have expanded the women, infants, and children and children will have access to the health and nutrition services they need. we established a comprehensive effort to immunize children, after defeating republican opposition led by senator dole. last year, the percentage of two-year-olds in america who were fully immunized reached an historic high. the clinton-gore administration has dramatically shortened the approval process for new lifesaving drugs at the food and drug administration and will continue to work to streamline the process further; we have paid special attention to women's health issues, including a percent increase for breast cancer research; and we have made aids research, prevention, and treatment a top priority, increasing funding by almost percent, including more than doubling the ryan white care act to help care for people with aids. we are committed to finding a cure for breast cancer and aids, and doing more to help all americans live longer, healthier lives. the democratic party is proud that we held the line against the republicans' mean- spirited medicare and medicaid cuts that would risk the health care of millions of americans, from infants to seniors. senator dole voted against medicare when it was first created, and now republican leaders want medicare to ""wither on the vine."" the dole-gingrich medicare plan would put millions of our parents into a second class health care system for the first time in their lives, and we will not stand for it. the dole-gingrich medicaid plan would end the guarantee to meaningful health benefits for millions of children, older americans, and people with disabilities. the democratic party wants america to preserve and strengthen medicare and medicaid, so we honor our values and protect the health of our children, parents, and grandparents, ensuring they can get the health care they need, from doctors' visits to long-term care. in -- without a single republican vote -- president clinton and democrats in congress extended the medicare trust fund into the 21st century. we have given states more flexibility to run their medicaid programs more efficiently and expand coverage, while maintaining the guarantee of meaningful benefits. when these plans are implemented, two million more americans will have health insurance because of them. we have given medicare beneficiaries more health plan choices and increased benefits. we have cracked down on health care waste, fraud, and abuse, saving more than $ billion in three years. now we must finish the job -- we can balance the budget while we preserve and strengthen medicare and medicaid, protecting millions of middle class families from being overwhelmed by health care costs for their parents. children, or family members with disabilities. we must move forward to reform our health care system to stop insurance companies from denying coverage to families where one member has a preexisting condition, and we must make sure that people can take their health insurance with them when they change jobs. no more americans should have to turn down a better job because they would lose their health care if they took it. as we take steps to ensure that americans have access to quality, affordable health care, we should start by making sure that people get help paying premiums so they do not lose health care while they're looking for a new job. we support expanded coverage of home care, hospice, and community-based services, so the elderly and people with disabilities of all ages can live in their own communities and as independently as possible. retirement. over the last four years, president clinton took strong steps to protect the pensions of more than million workers and retirees by fixing the federal pension insurance system and demanding that companies fund their retirement plans fully. we established a nationwide retirement protection program to protect workers' 401k retirement savings from fraud and abuse. we recognize the unique concerns of women when it comes to preparing for retirement and have worked to protect women's pension rights. over the next four years, we want to take further steps to make sure that americans who have worked hard for their whole lives can enjoy retirement in the dignity and security they have earned. we want to make sure people can carry their pensions with them when they change jobs, protect pensions even further, and expand the number of workers with pension coverage. democrats created social security, we oppose efforts to dismantle it, and we will fight to save it. we must ensure that it is on firm financial footing well into the next century. we call on republicans to put politics aside and join us in a serious bipartisan effort to make sure that social security will continue to provide true security for future generations, as it has done for millions of older americans for decades. training. we must do more to make sure all americans have the skills they need to compete. we want a g.i. bill for workers to transform the confusing tangle of federal training programs into a simple job-training skill grant that will go directly to unemployed workers so they will be able to get the training that is right for them. we want to strengthen training opportunities for people with disabilities, so they can learn the skills they need to live independent, productive lives. standing up for working americans. we nearly doubled funding for the dislocated worker program and launched special projects to help workers displaced by base closures, natural disasters. and mass layoffs. we are reforming osha so it can do a better job to protect worker safety with less red tape, and we continue to oppose republican efforts to gut it. we beat back efforts to undermine workers' rights to form and join unions and to dismantle the enforcement powers of the national labor relations board. we vigorously oppose republican efforts to pass right-to-work legislation, and to undermine collective bargaining through the team act. we are working to eradicate sweatshops in the u.s. apparel industry by stepping up enforcement and public education. we oppose the hiring of permanent workers to replace lawful economic strikers; we support the president's action to stop the government from procuring goods and services from companies that do so; and we support legislation to prohibit the permanent replacement of lawfully striking workers. we believe in equal pay for equal work and pay equity. promoting economic growth and opportunity for all americans. we know that it is good for america when small, minority, and women-owned businesses have the opportunity to grow and prosper. these business-owners create new jobs, expand opportunities, and serve as powerful role models for young people. over the last four years, the president has transformed small business administration to eliminate burdensome paperwork and deliver real assistance to entrepreneurs as they work to start or expand their businesses. at the same time, since bill clinton became president, we have more than doubled the number of loans to small businesses. from , in to , in , including a percent increase in loans to women-owned businesses and a nearly percent increase in loans to minority businesses. the president ordered all federal agencies to comply with laws designed to ensure that small, minority, and women-owned businesses can compete for their fair share of procurement dollars. corporate citizenship. employers have a responsibility to do their part as well. president clinton and the democratic party stand on the side of working families. we believe that values like loyalty. fairness, and responsibility are not inconsistent with the bottom line. we call on our corporate leaders to invest in the long-term, by providing workers with good wages and benefits, education and training, and opportunities for greater involvement in company decision making. as workers increase their productivity, employers should make sure they share in the benefits of the good years, as well as the burdens of the bad ones. employers should respect the commitment of workers to their families, and should work to provide good pensions and health care. when ceos put their workers and long-term success ahead of short-term gain, their workers will do better and so will they. responsibility today's democratic party knows that the era of big government is over. big bureaucracies and washington solutions do not have the real answers to today's challenges. we need a smaller government . . . and we must have a larger national spirit. government's job should be to give people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives. americans must take the responsibility to use them, to build good lives for themselves and their families. personal responsibility is the most powerful force we have to meet our challenges and shape the future we want for ourselves, for our children, and for america. fighting crime. today's democratic party believes the first responsibility of government is law and order. four years ago, crime in america seemed intractable. the violent crime rate and the murder rate had climbed for seven straight years. drugs seemed to flow freely across our borders and into our neighborhoods. convicted felons could walk into any gun shop in the country and buy a handgun. military-style assault weapons were sold freely. our people didn't feel safe in their homes, walking their streets, or even sending their children to school. under the thumb of special interests like the gun lobby, republicans talked tough about crime but did nothing to fight it. bill clinton promised to turn things around, and that is exactly what he did. after a long hard fight. president clinton beat back fierce republican opposition, led by senator dole and speaker gingrich. to answer the call of america's police officers and pass the toughest crime bill in history. the democratic party under president clinton is putting more police on the streets and tougher penalties on the books; we are taking guns off the streets and working to steer young people away from crime and gangs and drugs in the first place. and it is making a difference. in city after city and town after town, crime rates are finally coming down. community policing. nothing is more effective in the fight against crime than police officers on the beat, engaged in community policing. the crime bill is putting , new police officers on the street. we deplore cynical republican attempts to undermine our promise to america to put , new police officers on the street. we pledge to stand up for our communities and stand with our police officers by opposing any attempt to repeal or weaken this effort. but we know that community policing only works when the community works with the police. we echo the president's challenge to americans: if citizens joined each of america's . neighborhood watch groups, we would have a citizen force of one million strong to give our police forces the backup they need. protecting our children, our neighborhoods, and our police from criminals with guns. bob dole, newt gingrich, and george bush were able to hold the brady bill hostage for the gun lobby until bill clinton became president. with his leadership, we made the brady bill the law of the land. and because we did, more than , felons, fugitives, and stalkers have been stopped from buying guns. president clinton led the fight to ban deadly assault weapons, designed for one purpose only -- to kill human beings. we oppose efforts to restrict weapons used for legitimate sporting purposes, and we are proud that not one hunter or sportsman was forced to change guns because of the assault weapons ban. but we know that the military-style guns we banned have no place on america's streets, and we are proud of the courageous democrats who defied the gun lobby and sacrificed their seats in congress to make america safer. today's democratic party stands with america's police officers. we are proud to tell them that as long as bill clinton and al gore are in the white house, any attempt to repeal the brady bill or assault weapons ban will be met with a veto. we must do everything we can to stand behind our police officers, and the first thing we should do is pass a ban on cop-killer bullets. any bullet that can rip through a bulletproof vest should be against the law; that is the least we can do to protect the brave police officers who risk their lives to protect us. tough punishment. we believe that people who break the law should be punished, and people who commit violent crimes should be punished severely. president clinton made three- strikes you're-out the law of the land, to ensure that the most dangerous criminals go to jail for life, with no chance of parole, and signed a law to limit appeals. we established the death penalty for nearly violent crimes, including murder of a law enforcement officer. we provided almost $ billion in new funding to help states build new prison cells so violent offenders serve their full sentences. we call on the states to meet the president's challenge and guarantee that serious violent criminals serve at least percent of their sentence. the american people deserve a criminal justice system in which criminals are caught, the guilty are convicted, and the convicted serve their time. fighting youth crime and violence. nothing we do to fight crime is more important than fighting the crime and violence that threatens our children. we have to protect them from criminals who prey on them -- and we have to teach them good values and give them something to say yes to, so they stay away from crime and trouble in the first place. the democratic party understands what the police have been saying for years: the best way to fight crime is to prevent it. that is why we fought for drug-education and gang prevention programs in our schools. we support well thought out, well organized, highly supervised youth programs to provide young people with a safe and healthy alternative to hanging out on the streets. we made it a federal crime for any person under the age of to carry a handgun except when supervised by an adult. democrats fought to pass, and president clinton ordered states to impose, zero tolerance for guns in school, requiring schools to expel for one year any student who brings a gun to school. at the same time, when young people cross the line, they must be punished. when young people commit serious violent crimes, they should be prosecuted like adults. we established boot camps for young non-violent offenders. if senator dole and the republicans are serious about fighting juvenile crime, they should listen to america's police officers and support the steps democrats have taken, because they are making a difference, and then they should join us as we work to do more. we want parents to bring order to their children's lives and teach them right from wrong, and we want to make it easier for them to take that responsibility. we support schools that adopt school uniform policies, to promote discipline and respect. we support community-based curfews to keep kids off the street after a certain time, so they're safe from harm and away from trouble. we urge schools and communities to enforce truancy laws: young people belong in school, not on the street. we also know that we must do everything we can to help families protect their children, especially from dangerous criminals who have made a dark habit of preying on young people. study after study shows that sex offenders are likely to repeat their crimes again and again. under president clinton, we have taken strong steps to help keep children safe. we required every state in the country to compile a registry of sex offenders. the president signed megan's law to require that states tell a community whenever a dangerous sexual predator enters its midst. we support the president's directive to the attorney general, calling on her to work with the states and congress to develop a national sex offender registry. this will ensure that police officers in every state can get the information they need from any state to track sex offenders down and bring them to justice when they commit new crimes. battling illegal drugs. we must keep drugs off our streets and out of our schools. president clinton and the democratic party have waged an aggressive war on drugs. the crime bill established the death penalty for drug kingpins. the president signed a directive requiring drug testing of anyone arrested for a federal crime, and he challenged states to do the same for state offenders. we established innovative drug courts which force drug users to get treatment or go to jail. we stood firm against republican efforts to gut the safe and drug free schools effort that supports successful drug-education programs like d.a.r.e. the clinton administration went to the supreme court to support the right of schools to test athletes for drugs. the president launched operation safe home to protect the law-abiding residents of public housing from violent criminals and drug dealers who use their homes as a base for illegal activities. we support the president's decision to tell those who commit crimes and peddle drugs in public housing: you will get no second chance to threaten your neighbors; it is one strike and you're out. we are making progress. overall drug use in america is dropping; the number of americans who use cocaine has dropped percent since . unfortunately casual drug use by young people continues to climb. we must redouble our efforts against drug abuse everywhere, especially among our children. earlier this year, the president appointed general barry mccaffrey to lead the nation's war on drugs. general mccaffrey is implementing an aggressive four part strategy to reach young children and prevent drug use in the first place; to catch and punish drug users and dealers; to provide treatment to those who need help; and to cut drugs off at the source before they cross the border and pollute our neighborhoods. but every adult in america must take responsibility to set a good example, and to teach children that drugs are wrong, they are illegal, and they are deadly. ending domestic violence. when it strikes, nothing is a more dangerous threat to the safety of our families than domestic violence, because it is a threat from within. unfortunately, violence against women is no stranger to america, but a dangerous intruder we must work together to drive from our homes. we know that domestic violence is not a 'family problem"" or ""a women's problem."" it is america's problem, and we must all fight it. the violence against women act in the crime bill helps police officers, prosecutors, and judges to understand domestic violence. recognize it when they see it, and know how to deal with it. in february, the president launched a hour, seven-day, toll-free hotline so women in trouble can find out how to get emergency help, find shelter, and report abuse to the authorities. the number is -safe. everyone who knows it should pass it on to anyone who might need it. every american must take the responsibility to stop this terrible scourge. as we fight it, we must remember that the victims are not to blame. this is a crime to be punished, not a secret to be concealed. we must do everything we can to make sure that the victims of violent crime are treated with the respect and the dignity they deserve. we support the president's call for a constitutional amendment to protect the rights of victims. we believe that when a plea bargain is entered in public. a criminal is sentenced, or a defendant is let out on bail, the victims ought to know about it. and have a say. a constitutional amendment is the only way to protect those rights in every courtroom in america. immigration. democrats remember that we are a nation of immigrants. we recognize the extraordinary contribution of immigrants to america throughout our history. we welcome legal immigrants to america. we support a legal immigration policy that is pro-family, pro work, pro responsibility, and pro-citizenship, and we deplore those who blame immigrants for a nation of laws. we cannot tolerate illegal immigration and we must stop it. for years before bill clinton became president, washington talked tough but failed to act. in , our borders might as well not have existed. the southwest border was under-patrolled, and what patrols there were, were under-equipped. drugs flowed freely. illegal immigration was rampant. criminal immigrants, deported after committing crimes in america, returned the very next day to commit crimes again. president clinton is making the southwest border a place where the law is respected and drugs and illegal immigrants are turned away. we have increased the border patrol by over percent; in el paso, our border patrol agents are so close together they can see each other. last year alone, the clinton administration removed over , illegal workers from jobs across the country. just since january of , we have arrested more than , criminal aliens and prosecuted them on federal felony charges because they returned to america after having been deported. however as we work to stop illegal immigration, we call on all americans to avoid the temptation to use this issue to divide people from each other. we deplore those who use the need to stop illegal immigration as a pretext for discrimination. and we applaud the wisdom of republicans like mayor giuliani and senator domenici who oppose the mean-spirited and short- sighted effort of republicans in congress to bar the children of illegal immigrants from schools - - it is wrong and forcing children onto the streets is an invitation for them to join gangs and turn to crime. democrats want to protect american jobs by increasing criminal and civil sanctions against employers who hire illegal workers, but republicans continue to favor inflammatory rhetoric over real action. we will continue to enforce labor standards to protect workers in vulnerable industries. we continue to firmly oppose welfare benefits for illegal immigrants. we believe family members who sponsor immigrants into this country should take financial responsibility for them, and be held legally responsible for supporting them. welfare reform. today's democratic party knows there is no greater gap between mainstream american values and modern american government than our failed welfare system. when bill clinton became president, the welfare system undermined the very values -- work, family and personal responsibility -- that it should promote. the welfare system should reflect those values: we want to help people who want to help themselves and their children. over the past four years, president clinton -- acting alone -- has dramatically transformed the welfare system. he has freed states from federal rules and regulations so they can reform their welfare systems. the clinton administration has granted waivers -- more than twice as many waivers as granted in the reagan-bush years. for percent of all americans on welfare, the rules have changed for good already, and welfare is becoming what it should be: a second chance not a way of life. welfare rolls are finally coming down -- there are . million fewer people on welfare today than there were when president clinton took office in january . the president has also taken strong executive action to make sure that the welfare system strengthens families and demands responsibility. he ordered states to require minor mothers to stay in school and turn their lives around so they can get a job and get off welfare for good. he also directed states to require mothers to help identity and find absent fathers so we can make them pay the child support they owe. he challenged all states to require teen mothers to live at home or with a responsible adult. and the president fought to make sure that poor children get health care and nutrition to meet their basic needs. now we must finish the job, and pass national welfare reform. unfortunately, the plan proposed by senator dole and speaker gingrich was weak on work and tough on children. that is the wrong approach. we should be tough on work and demand responsibility, but we should not punish children for their parents' mistakes. a real bipartisan welfare reform plan should require that anyone on welfare who can work, goes to work. and we should provide child care and health care so parents can work. we should impose strict time limits so that no one who can work can stay on welfare forever. we should require minor mothers to live with their parents or another responsible adult. if the republican party puts politics aside, we can finish the job president clinton started, and end welfare as we know it across america. passing legislation is not enough; we should make sure people get the skills they need to get jobs, and that there are jobs for them to go to so they leave welfare and stay off. welfare reform should put more people to work and move them into the economic mainstream, not take jobs away from working families. child support. nobody has the right to walk away from the responsibility to care for his or her children. if you owe child support, paying it fully and promptly is just the first step in living up to your responsibility as a parent. the clinton administration has made a determined effort to crack down on deadbeat parents, collecting a record $ billion in through tough enforcement -- almost a percent increase over . president clinton issued an executive order to track down federal workers who fail to pay child support, and force them to pay. president clinton, congressional democrats, and democratic governors all know that the toughest possible child support enforcement must be a central part of any real welfare reform plan -- including the president's plan to deny drivers licenses and professional licenses to people who do not pay their child support. we must tell deadbeats: if you neglect your responsibility to your children, we will suspend your license, garnish your wages, track you down, and make you pay. teen pregnancy. for the first time in years, the teen pregnancy rate has leveled off and begun to drop. but we all know it is still far too high. government alone cannot solve this problem. that is why president clinton challenged community, business, and religious leaders together to form a national campaign to keep the teen pregnancy rate going down. and he expanded support for community-based prevention programs that teach abstinence and demand responsibility. we must send the strongest possible signal to young people that it is wrong to get pregnant or father a child until they are married and ready to support that child and raise that child. we also know that half of all underage mothers were made pregnant by a man in his twenties, or even older. statutory rape is a crime, but unfortunately the laws that protect young women from it are almost never enforced. we echo the president's call to america's prosecutors: enforce the statutory rape laws vigorously against men who prey on underage women. choice. the democratic party stands behind the right of every woman to choose, consistent with roe v. wade, and regardless of ability to pay. president clinton took executive action to make sure that the right to make such decisions is protected for all americans. over the last four years. we have taken action to end the gag rule and ensure safety at family planning and women's health clinics. we believe it is a fundamental constitutional liberty that individual americans -- not government -- can best take responsibility for making the most difficult and intensely personal decisions regarding reproduction. the democratic party is a party of inclusion. we respect the individual conscience of each american on this difficult issue, and we welcome all our members to participate at every level of our party. our goal is to make abortion less necessary and more rare, not more difficult and more dangerous. we support contraceptive research, family planning, comprehensive family life education, and policies that support healthy childbearing. for four years in a row, we have increased support for family planning. the abortion rate is dropping. now we must continue to support efforts to reduce unintended pregnancies, and we call on all americans to take personal responsibility to meet this important goal. reinventing government. the american people have a right to demand that responsibility is the order of the day in washington. the mission of today's democratic party is to expand opportunity, not bureaucracy. we have worked hard over the last four years to rein in big government, slash burdensome regulations, eliminate wasteful programs, and shift problem- solving out of washington and back to people and communities who understand their situations best. in the last four years, president clinton, working with the national performance review chaired by vice president gore, has cut the federal government by almost , positions, making the smallest federal government in years. the federal government is eliminating , pages of outdated and unnecessary regulations, has abolished programs and projects. and saved taxpayers billions of dollars. the president fought for and signed unfunded mandates legislation. this stops congress from requiring state and local governments to implement expensive policies without providing any means to pay for them, and encourages better partnerships and more balance of resources and responsibilities. after presidents since ulysses s. grant tried to get the line-item veto and failed, president clinton signed landmark legislation that will give the president this powerful tool to cut pork-barrel spending from bills passed by congress. for years. republicans talked about making government smaller while letting it grow -- democrats are doing it. for years, republicans talked about cutting the deficit while letting it climb democrats are doing it. for years, republicans talked about shifting power back to states and communities -- democrats are doing it. for years, republicans talked about making government more businesslike and efficient -- democrats are doing it. democrats are bringing responsibility back to washington. in the last two years, republicans under senator dole and speaker gingrich shut the federal government down in an irresponsible attempt at partisan blackmail. democrats under president clinton said, and america agreed: partisan threats are no way to run a government. nobody should ever shut down the government again. the republican shutdown cost the taxpayers $. billion. democrats believe government should work better and cost less -- not work less and cost more. the republican shutdown was an affront to the hardworking public servants in our cities, towns, states. and nation who devote their lives to improving life in our country. thanks to them our streets are safer, our water is cleaner, and our nation is secure. front-line federal workers committed to providing quality services have joined the president's efforts to make government work better for the american people. with their help, we are saving money for the taxpayers and improving services for our people. in the last four years, we have transformed the federal emergency management agency from an outdated bureaucracy into a swift and effective agent of relief for victims of earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, or other disasters. americans with life-threatening diseases like cancer and aids gain access to new drugs faster, because the food and drug administration has streamlined its approval process, become more flexible in certifications, and eliminated unnecessary paperwork. the small business administration has eliminated half of its regulations. cut loan applications as long as pages down to one, and doubled its loan volume -- all helping americans to produce record numbers of small businesses in each of the last three years. american home buyers are saving an average of $, in closing costs because the department of housing and urban development has eliminated paperwork and other unnecessary burdens. over the next four years, the democratic party will continue to make responsibility the rule in washington: cutting bureaucracy further, improving customer service, demanding better performance, holding people and agencies accountable for producing the best results, ensuring all americans have access to high quality public services, and forging new partnerships with the private sector including small, minority, and women-owned businesses, and with state and local governments. political reform. today's democratic party knows we have a responsibility to make our democracy work better for america, by limiting the influence of special interests and expanding the influence of the american people. special interests have too much power in the halls of government. they often operate in secret and have special privileges ordinary americans do not even know exist. elections have become so expensive that big money can sometimes drown out the voices of ordinary voters -- who should always speak the loudest. shortly after bill clinton took office, he implemented the toughest ethics code on executive officials in history: senior appointees are barred from lobbying their own agencies for five years after they leave, and they can never lobby for foreign governments. after years of republican delay, democrats passed and the president signed the motor voter bill to make it easier for people to participate in our democracy and exercise their civic responsibility in the voting booth. the president led the fight to repeal the tax loophole that let lobbyists deduct the cost of their activities, and prevailed. in , after a republican filibuster, congress finally answered the president's call to stop taking gifts, meals, and trips from lobbyists; to bring lobbyists out from dark rooms and into the bright light of public scrutiny by requiring full disclosure; and to apply to itself the laws that apply to the rest of the country. but we must take further strong action. the president and the democratic party support the bipartisan mccain-feingold campaign finance reform bill. it will limit campaign spending, curb the influence of pacs and lobbyists, and end the soft money system. perhaps most important of all, this bill provides free tv time for candidates, so they can talk directly to citizens about real issues and real ideas. unfortunately, republicans in congress will not even let this bill come up for a vote. we call on them to stop stonewalling. it is time to take the reins of democracy away from big money and put them back in the hands of the american people, where they belong. we applaud efforts by broadcasters and private citizens alike, to increase candidates' direct access to voters through free tv. finally, we believe all americans have a right to fair political representation -- including the citizens of the district of columbia which deserves statehood. we recognize the existing status of the commonwealth of puerto rico and the strong economic relationship between the people of puerto rico and the united states. we pledge to support the right of the people of the commonwealth of puerto rico to choose freely, and in concert with the u.s. congress their relationship with the united states, either as an enhanced commonwealth, a state or an independent nation. security, freedom, and peace the firm, sustained use of american might and diplomacy helped win the greatest victory for freedom in this half of the century -- the end of the cold war. but to meet the challenges of this new era of promise and peril, america needed leadership that was able to see the contours of the new world -- and willing to act with steadiness, strength, and flexibility in the face of change to make the most of it. president clinton and vice president gore have seized the opportunities of the post cold war era over the past four years, their leadership has made america safer, more prosperous, and more engaged in solving the challenges of a new era. four years ago, thousands of russian nuclear weapons were aimed at american cities. today. not a single russian missile points at our children, and through the start treaties, we will cut american and russian nuclear arsenals by two-thirds from their cold war height. four years ago, the forces of reform in the former soviet union were embattled. today, peace initiatives are helping democracy and free markets take root throughout the region, russian troops are out of the baltics, and democracy has triumphed in russia's elections. four years ago, the middle east process had not moved beyond a set of principles, and there were no signs of peace in northern ireland. today, in the middle east we have seen real agreements toward peace, and handshakes of history, and the people of northern ireland have seen a cease-fire and the first negotiations among the parties. four years ago, the north koreans were operating a dangerous nuclear program. today, that program is frozen, under international inspection, and slated to be dismantled. four years ago, the north atlantic treaty organization -- the bulwark of western security during the cold war -- was losing direction and support. today, nato is keeping the peace in bosnia with its partnership for peace allies and, as a result of american leadership, preparing to welcome new members from central europe. four years ago, america stood aloof as war and genocide spread through the former yugoslavia. today, thanks to nato airstrikes, american diplomacy and the deployment of troops from the u.s. and other nations, the war has stopped and bosnia has its first real chance for a lasting peace. four years ago, dictators ruled in haiti, abusing human rights and leaving thousands of its citizens desperate to flee to our shores. today, the dictators are gone, democracy has been restored, and haiti's mass-exodus has stopped. four years ago, south africa was struggling under political violence associated with apartheid. now, following the elections -- which the united states strongly supported -- there is a national unity government and south africa is free and democratic. four years ago, there was good reason to worry that the world was dividing into separate, isolated, regional trading blocks. today, thanks to clinton administration efforts to find new markets for american products and strengthen our existing ties, america's relations with our trading parties around the world are stronger than ever. we applaud efforts like the summit of the americas, the asian pacific economic cooperation meetings, and, especially, the extraordinary leadership of commerce secretary ron brown on behalf of american industry and workers everywhere. ron brown will always be remembered with great pride and the deepest gratitude by the democratic party and by all americans. the clinton-gore administration's record of leadership has deterred america's adversaries and earned respect from our allies and partners. the dole-gingrich congress and the republican party have a different approach to america's security. too often they would force america to go it alone -- or not at all. their shortsighted approach has cut resources for diplomacy that could strengthen our security, and reflects an inadequate understanding of the threats and opportunities of this new era. today's democratic party is unwilling to surrender to the voices of retreat and indifference. we believe the only way to ensure america's security and prosperity over the long run is to continue exerting american leadership across a range of military, diplomatic, and humanitarian, challenges around the world. led by president clinton and vice president gore, today's democratic party has set a far reaching agenda to strengthen our security, and promote peace and freedom. strengthening our security. the highest imperative for our security is the protection of our people, our territory, and our key interests abroad. while both parties share a commitment to strong security, there is a real difference. the republican desire to spend more money on defense than the pentagon requests cannot obscure their inability to recognize the challenges of a new era and build the balanced defenses we need to meet them. today's democratic party is committed to strengthening our military and adapting it to new challenges; reducing the threat of weapons of mass destruction; and meeting new challenges to our security such as terrorism, international crime, and drug trafficking. strengthening our military. over the past four years, the administration has undertaken the most successful restructuring of our military forces in history. even as the size of our forces has decreased, their capabilities, readiness and qualitative edge have increased. the administration has ensured that america is prepared to fight alongside others when we can, and alone when we must. we have defeated attempts to cut our defense budget irresponsibly. three times in three years, president clinton has increased our defense spending plans -- a total of almost $ billion -- for readiness, force modernization, and quality of life improvements. we will continue our work to ensure that the men and women who wear american uniforms receive adequate pay and support, including: childcare, housing, and access to quality health care for themselves and their families. the administration defense plan reverses the downward trend in procurement with a % real increase for weapons modernization by . at the same time, as part of its reinventing government program, the administration has fundamentally reformed government procurement rules in order to get the most for our money. use of force. the united states must be prepared to use military force ecisively when necessary to defend our vital interests. the burdens of ollective security in a new era must be shared fairly, and we should ncourage multilateral peacekeeping through the united nations and other nternational efforts. preventing and containing conflict. american olicy must be focused on averting military threats as well as meeting them. to alt the spread of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, we must lead renewed international effort to get tough with companies that peddle nuclear nd chemical warfare technologies, strengthen the international atomic energy gency, and enforce strong sanctions against governments that violate nternational restraints. a comprehensive test ban would strengthen our bility to stop the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries, which may be ur greatest future security threat. we must press for strong international imits on the dangerous and wasteful flow of conventional arms to troubled egions. we will encourage congress to ratify the start ii treaty with russia, hich will reduce nuclear stockpiles by another %. repeatedly during the past four years -- from the persian gulf to bosnia -- our men and women in uniform have proven they are the best trained, best equipped, best prepared fighting force in the world. the democratic party is committed to build on this record by fully funding the pentagon's -year defense plan; undertaking a second fundamental review of our defense structure; finding new ways for our service branches to work jointly to increase our war fighting capabilities; and ensuring that our troops can dominate the battlefield of the future. we honor america's veterans; they put their lives on the line to protect our way of life and promote our values around the world. today's democratic party will stand by america's duty to our veterans. president clinton and vice president gore have fought hard to protect veterans' benefits; to expand disability benefits for vietnam veterans exposed to agent orange; aggressively responding to veterans of the persian gulf war suffering from undiagnosed illnesses; promoting veterans employment; and improving and strengthening the medical system of the veterans administration. reducing the threat of weapons of mass destruction. strengthening our security also requires an aggressive effort against weapons of mass destruction -- nuclear, chemical, and biological -- and their means of delivery. from the nuclear weapons programs in iraq and north korea to the sarin gas attack in the tokyo subway, our nation has seen that this threat is clear and present. to meet it, we must seize the opportunities presented by the end of the cold war to cut weapons of mass destruction stockpiles while working to prevent lethal weapons and materials from falling into the wrong hands. president clinton and vice president gore have pursued the most far reaching arms control and non-proliferation agenda in history. they negotiated an agreement to end the targeting of russian nuclear missiles on american cities and citizens. they secured ratification of start ii which, along with start i will reduce russian and american arsenals by two- thirds. they prevented the breakup of the soviet union from yielding three new nuclear weapons states, by convincing ukraine, belarus, and kazakhstan to give up their nuclear weapons. they secured the indefinite and unconditional extension of the nuclear non- proliferation treaty. they acted to freeze north korea's nuclear program. the democratic party supports efforts to sign a comprehensive test ban treaty this year and to bring it into force as soon as possible. we support immediate ratification of the chemical weapons convention -- delayed too long by the dole senate. we support full funding of the nunn-lugar cooperative threat reduction program to ensure that nuclear materials in the former soviet union do not fall into the wrong hands. we support vigilant efforts, in cooperation with the republic of korea, japan, and others, to ensure north korea fully abides by its agreements to dismantle its nuclear program, and we support the administration's vigorous efforts to prevent iraq, iran, and other dangerous states from acquiring or developing weapons of mass destruction. the democratic party is committed to a strong and balanced national missile defense program. the administration is spending $ billion a year on six different systems to protect our troops in the field and our allies from short and medium range missiles. to prepare for the possibility of a long range missile attack on american soil by a rogue state, the clinton administration is committed to developing by the year a defensive system that could be deployed by , well before the threat becomes real. the democratic party opposes the republican nmd plan - spending up to $ billion on a revival of the star wars program that would force us to choose a costly system today that could be obsolete tomorrow. the republican plan would waste money, weaken america's defenses and violate existing arms control agreements that make us more secure. it is the wrong way to defend america. meeting new challenges. today's democratic party knows that stronger security requires vigorous efforts to address the new dangers of this era. chief among these are the interwoven threats of terrorism, drug trafficking, and international crime. we have seen the terrible toll they have exacted -- the murder of american soldiers in their barracks in saudi arabia and of innocent civilians on buses in israel; corruption and crime from the former soviet union to latin america. we know these vicious criminals pay no heed to borders; we have seen flrsthand the awful, evil work of the forces of terror at the world trade center and in oklahoma city. and we know all too well the havoc drugs wreak when they cross our borders and flow through our neighborhoods. the clinton-gore administration has mounted the most aggressive effort in american history to combat terrorism, drug trafficking, and international crime. we captured and convicted the perpetrators of the world trade center bombing. we enacted a strong new anti- terrorism law, in spite of foot dragging by the republican congress. we convened an historic summit of mideast leaders at sharm el-sheik to coordinate anti-terrorism efforts, and made anti- terrorism a centerpiece of the g- summit. we imposed or maintained strong sanctions against states that sponsor terrorism, including iran, iraq, libya, and sudan, and made clear to syria that normal relations depend on concrete steps to end its support for groups involved with terrorism. we opposed irresponsible cuts to u.s. intelligence programs and supported efforts to reorganize and strengthen the full range of intelligence agencies and programs. we opened fbi centers to provide anti-crime and anti-terrorism training. we made colombia ineligible for most american assistance after that country's leadership failed to cooperate with american anti- narcotics efforts. today's democratic party is determined to keep the war on global terrorism, narcotics, and crime at the center of our security agenda. we will seek increased cooperation from our allies and friends abroad in fighting these threats. we will continue to work aggressively to shut off foreign drug flows, eradicate foreign drug crops, and assist countries that demonstrate active cooperation. promoting peace and democracy. today's democratic party knows that peace and democracy are products of decisive strength and active diplomacy. that diplomacy must protect our interests while also projecting our values. the republican party too often has neglected diplomatic opportunities, slashed the budgets necessary for diplomatic successes, and overlooked the importance to our own security of democracy and human rights abroad. at its core, the republican party is locked in a cold war mentality, and lacks a coherent strategy to nurture and strengthen the global progress toward peace and democracy. the democratic party believes a key to strengthening peace is stable and peaceful relations among the world's major powers. that has been the driving force behind much of the clinton-gore administration's work, from its peace initiative in bosnia to new security agreements with japan. we are committed to promoting democracy in regions and countries important to america's security, and to standing with all those willing to take risks for peace, from the middle east to northern ireland. and we are committed to doing it with all the tools we have: with diplomacy where possible, with force where necessary, and working with others where appropriate --our allies, willing partners, the u.n. and other security organizations -- to share the risks and costs of our leadership. europe and the former soviet union. today's democratic party knows that the security of europe remains a vital american interest. we applaud the clinton-gore administration's efforts to foster a peaceful, democratic and undivided europe -- including expanded support for reform in former communist states; dramatically increased assistance to ukraine; the partnership for peace program of military cooperation with europe's new democracies; its steady, determined work to add new central european members to nato in the near future; and its efforts to resolve regional disputes such as between greece and turkey. we support continued efforts to secure a just and lasting peace in bosnia, northern ireland and cyprus. we are committed to the success of independence in ukraine and the baltics. and we support the continuing evolution of a prosperous and peaceful russia. and as part of our effort to support we will pursue a relationship in which we seek cooperation when we can, and frankly express disagreements where they exist, such as on chechnya. asia. we know that many of america's most pressing security challenges and most promising commercial opportunities lie in the asia pacific region. the democratic party applauds the important new security charter with japan, the administration's close cooperation with the republic of korea toward the goal of a unified and non-nuclear peninsula, and the deployment of an american naval task force to the taiwan straits to ensure that china's military exercises did not imperil the security of the region. the party supports the administration's policy of steady engagement to encourage a stable, open and prosperous china-- a china that respects human rights throughout its land and in tibet, that joins international efforts against weapons proliferation, and that plays by the rules of free and fair trade. today's democratic party strongly supports continued american troop presence in east asia and efforts to promote increased regional security. and we are committed to building long-term relationships with india. pakistan, and others in south asia in order to advance america's diverse interests in that region, from democracy and commerce to nuclear non-proliferation. the middle east. president clinton has overseen a remarkable record of achievement toward peace and security in the middle east -- the israeli-palestinian accords; the peace agreement between israel and jordan; new regional security and investment summits; israel's increased acceptance throughout the middle east and the world; the dual containment of iraq and iran. the democratic party is committed to help build on this record, knowing that peace and security are indivisible. the democratic party remains committed to america's long-standing special relationship with israel, based on shared values, a mutual commitment to democracy and a strategic alliance that benefits both nations. the united states should continue to help israel maintain its qualitative edge so that israel has the confidence to pursue peace. jerusalem is the capital of israel and should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths. we also support close ties with states and peoples in the arab and islamic world committed to non- aggression and willing to take risks for peace. latin america. the clinton-gore administration forged an historic partnership with the democracies of the western hemisphere, as reflected in the summit of the americas. today. every country in the hemisphere is a democracy except cuba. because democratic stability and prosperity in the countries to our south are in their interest and ours, president clinton took bold steps to bolster mexico's economy when it was threatened by crisis; worked to resolve internal and border conflicts in the hemisphere; joined with regional partners to combat narcotics trafficking; and maintained a tough embargo against cuba while reaching out to its people. the democratic party is committed to further consolidating democracy, stability, and open markets throughout the hemisphere. africa. the clinton administration championed south africa's democratic transition; supported africa's many emerging democracies and led international efforts to speed the return of democracy in nigeria; helped save countless lives in somalia, rwanda, and elsewhere through conflict resolution, removal of land mines, and humanitarian relief; and took steps to help sub- saharan africa's million people develop into strong economies and markets. the democratic party believes that continuing to help the people of africa nurture their continent's extraordinary potential and address its serious problems is both the right thing to do and profoundly in america's interest. promoting democracy. america remains a beacon of hope to all who cherish democracy and human rights, and america's security benefits from the enlargement of the community of market democracies. the clinton-gore administration has actively promoted the consolidation and spread of democracy and human rights: in russia and throughout the former soviet union, central europe, latin america, asia and africa. president clinton directed vice president gore to lead bi national efforts to establish trading relationships to help promote democracy in three strategic areas: russia, south africa, and egypt. the democratic party supports the aspirations of all those who seek to strengthen civil society and accountable governance. to this end. we support continued funding for the national endowment for democracy, radio free europe/radio liberty, the asia pacific network, radio marti and other efforts to promote democracy and the free flow of ideas. promoting democracy discussion resources for diplomacy. there is a price to be paid for america's security and its leadership in world affairs -- and the republican party now refuses to pay that price. even though less than one percent of the federal budget goes to foreign policy spending, the republican party has savaged our diplomatic readiness, defaulted on treaty obligations to pay dues to the united nations, slashed assistance to the poorest and most vulnerable populations on earth, and pushed the united states to dead last among developed nations in the global fight against starvation, infant mortality, natural disasters and environmental degradation and other worldwide problems. the democratic party understands that these efforts strengthen our security and express our values, and strongly supports the clinton-gore administration's work to ensure adequate resources for american foreign policy. community across america, in far too many places, the bonds of community that tie us together and remind us that we rise or fall together, have too often frayed. today's democratic party believes we must reawaken the strong sense of community that has helped america to prosper for years. america is uniquely suited to lead the world into the 21st century because of our great diversity and our shared values. we must never let our differences divide us from each other; instead we must come together on a new common ground, based on the enduring values we share. when americans work together -- in our homes, our schools, our houses of worship, our civic groups. our businesses -- we can meet any challenge, and realize every dream. putting families first. the first and most sacred responsibility of every parent is to cherish our children and strengthen our families. the family is the foundation of american life. after years of all family-values-talk and no family-values-action by the republicans, president clinton took office determined to put families first. we support the fundamental themes of the families first agenda -- promoting paycheck, health care, retirement, and personal security: creating greater educational and economic opportunity; and requiring greater responsibility from individuals, businesses, and government. standing up for parents. in the first month of bill clinton's presidency, the democratic party ended eight years of republican gridlock and enacted the family and medical leave act. americans blessed with a new child or troubled by a family health crisis can no longer be forced to choose between their families and their jobs. a bipartisan panel reported that million workers have already been able to live up to their family obligations without risking their jobs. and almost percent of businesses found that complying with this law cost them little or nothing. despite how important this is to american families, senator dole led republican opposition to it and still insists it was wrong. this law is good for families, it is good for america. and it would not be the law today without the democratic party. now we want to take the next step. we believe parents should be able to take unpaid leave from work and choose flex time so they can do their job as parents: to do things like go to parent-teacher conferences or take a child to the doctor. we support tax credits to encourage adoption, because every child deserves a mother and father who will love them and raise them. responsible entertainment. president clinton and vice president gore have led the fight to help parents control what their children see on television. because of their leadership, congress passed a law requiring all new televisions to include a device called a v-chip that will block violent programs when it is activated by an adult. senator dole likes to talk about tv violence, but when it came time to act, he stood with a small minority to oppose the bipartisan v-chip bill. the president achieved a breakthrough agreement with the media and entertainment industries to develop a rating system for tv shows similar to the motion picture rating system, so parents can make informed decisions about what they want their children to watch. when parents control the remote, it is not censorship, it is personal responsibility for their children's upbringing. we believe in public support for the arts, and especially for high-quality, family-friendly programming. we are proud to have stopped the republican attack on the corporation for public broadcasting -- we want our children to watch sesame street, not power rangers. and we echo the president's call to the entertainment industry: work harder to develop and promote movies, music, and tv shows that are suitable -- and educational -- for children. tobacco. cigarette smoking is rapidly becoming the single greatest threat to the health of our children. we know that , young people start smoking every day, and , of them will lead shorter lives because of it. despite that, senator dole and other republicans continue to ignore volumes of medical research to make baffling claims that cigarettes are not addictive. they even argue with distinguished republican experts like president reagan's surgeon general c. everett koop. president clinton and vice president gore understand that we have a responsibility to protect our children's future by cracking down on illegal sales of tobacco to minors and by curbing sophisticated advertising campaigns designed to entice kids to start smoking before they are old enough to make an informed decision. the president has proposed measures to cut off children's access to cigarettes, crack down on those who sell tobacco to minors illegally. and curtail advertising designed to appeal to children. we believe tobacco companies should market to adults if they wish, but take the responsibility to draw the line on children. parents responsibility. all of this is important, and we pledge to continue to fight for ways to strengthen our families. but today's democratic party knows that governments do not raise children, parents do. that is why president clinton and vice president gore took action to order all federal agencies to make sure everything government does for children promotes responsibility from all parents, fathers as well as mothers. now we challenge every parent to put their children first: to help them with their homework, to read to them, to know their teachers, and above all, to teach their children right from wrong and set the best example. community empowerment. today's democratic party understands that we cannot rebuild our poorest communities by imposing cookie-cutter solutions from washington. we have to give communities the tools they need to create opportunity. citizens, local government, the private sector, and civic groups must come together and take the responsibility to rebuild their communities from the bottom up. encouraging private sector investment, and community-based solutions. after over a decade of sustained republican neglect and empty republican promises, president clinton and democrats in congress launched a comprehensive strategy to unleash economic growth and restore opportunity to our distressed neighborhoods. without a single republican vote, we created empowerment zones and enterprise communities. this effort, chaired by vice president gore, is bringing jobs and businesses to our poorest urban and rural areas. thousands of new businesses have already moved into these areas, or expanded existing operations, bringing new hope and new jobs to these neighborhoods. we reformed the community reinvestment act to shift the focus from process toward results; we implemented low income mortgage purchase requirements on fannie mae and freddie mac; and we created a community development financial institutions fund. together, these efforts are unleashing billions of dollars in new private sector lending and investment for housing and economic development in our inner cities and poorest rural areas. the president and vice president have created a brownfields initiative to bring life back to abandoned and contaminated property by reforming outdated regulations and providing incentives for cleanup. over the next four years, we want a second round of empowerment zones to bring economic growth to more american communities; a significant expansion of the community development financial institutions fund to spur more private sector investment in local economies: and a new tax incentive to encourage further cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields. today's democratic party knows that the best way to bring jobs and growth back to our poorest neighborhoods is to harness the job-creating power of the private sector. helping people afford safe, secure housing. safe, secure housing is an essential part of strong communities and strong families. we are proud that after four years of a democrat in the white house, the percentage of people who own their own house climbed faster than it has in years. bill clinton took executive action to make it easier and cheaper for working and middle- class home buyers to get a home loan. we pledge to stand against republican efforts to repeal the deductibility of home mortgage interest payments. fulfilling his pledge, president clinton made the low-income housing tax credit permanent, encouraging private developers to build more affordable housing. this tax credit is making it easier for families to get housing, and we will stand against republican attacks on it. the clinton administration has made sweeping changes to transform the nation's public housing system after decades of neglect. in the last four years, democrats demolished more units of unlivable public housing than republicans did in the previous twelve years, replacing them with lower-density developments that can serve as anchors for neighborhood renewal. in the next four years, we want to transform the worst public housing from a system that traps people in rundown, crime-ridden projects into one which gives families the freedom to choose where they live by providing vouchers to help them with housing costs. we have dramatically increased help for the homeless, and shifted focus from temporary shelters toward permanent solutions designed to move people back into the mainstream, into jobs and a home of their own. agriculture and the rural community. america has the most abundant agricultural economy on earth, and it must be preserved and strengthened as we enter a new century. president clinton and the democrats have worked hard to promote economic growth in rural areas, protect the family farm, and ensure that farmers get a fair return for their labor and investment and consumers can continue to count on safe and nutritious foods. in the face of republican efforts to gut food safety, the clinton administration has revolutionized meat inspection and set a new standard of consumer protection. president clinton has reinvented the agriculture department, reducing regulations and bureaucracy and improving service. the clinton administration has cracked down on food stamp fraud, and approved experiments in state after state to reform the food stamp program. president clinton and democrats in congress supported new voluntary conservation programs and saved economic development programs for rural areas through the farm bill. we are committed to expanding agricultural exports by reducing unfair subsidies and trade barriers around the world. protecting our environment. today's democratic party wants all americans to be able to enjoy america's magnificent natural heritage -- and we want our people to know that the air they breathe is pure, the water they drink is clean, and the land they live on is safe from hazard. we understand we have a sacred obligation to protect god's earth and preserve our quality of life for our children and our children's children. for the republican years before bill clinton and al gore took office, protecting the environment was far from a priority. and in the last two years, years of bipartisan environmental progress -- started by a democratic congress under a republican president -- has come under attack from the far right. time and again, president clinton and the democratic party have stood firm against this onslaught. the republican congress, under senator dole and speaker gingrich, voted to cut environmental enforcement by percent. president clinton and democrats in congress said no. we believe government has a responsibility to enforce the laws that help keep toxic chemicals from our water, pesticides from our food, and smog from our air. the republican congress, under senator dole and speaker gingrich, let lobbyists for the polluters write their own loopholes into bills to weaken laws that protect the health and safety of our children. president clinton and democrats in congress said no. we believe america's elected officials have a responsibility to protect america's families from threats to their health, and that trust must never be abdicated -- especially not by placing control of environmental safeguards in the hands of the very polluters those safeguards are meant to keep in line. the republican congress, under senator dole and speaker gingrich, tried to make taxpayers pick up the tab for toxic wastes, and let polluters who caused the problem and can afford to fix it off the hook. president clinton and democrats in congress said no. we believe america should insist that toxic waste cleanup is paid for by those responsible for it in the first place -- and not foisted off on the taxpayers. in the last four years, president clinton and vice president gore have taken strong action to make our air and water cleaner. they reformed the superfund program -- in each of the last two years nearly as many toxic dumps were cleaned as in the previous decade. they dramatically strengthened community right-to-know efforts, because americans should be informed about toxic chemicals being released into the air and water so they can take steps to protect themselves and their families. they took measures to cut toxic air pollution from chemical plants by percent, and after years of republican neglect they cleaned up hundreds of nuclear weapons sites and are committed to finishing the job. today's democratic party knows that we can protect the environment and expand the economy. we believe we can create more jobs over the long run by cleaning the environment. we want to challenge businesses and communities to take more initiative in protecting the environment, and we want to make it easier for them to do it. president clinton and vice president gore launched project xl which tells businesses: if you can find a cheaper, more efficient way than government regulations require to meet even tougher pollution goals, do it -- as long as you do it right. this new approach offers business flexibility, incentives, and accountability. environmental protection should include more education on compliance for small and medium sized business, more strategies to increase compliance for all businesses, and tough enforcement -- including criminal prosecution -- for those who put human health and the environment at risk. we are committed to protecting the majestic legacy of our national parks and enhancing recreational opportunities; restoring the florida everglades; preserving our wildlife refuges and fighting off any effort to open the arctic national wildlife refuge to oil and gas drilling. we will be good stewards of our old-growth forests, oppose new offshore oil drilling and mineral exploration and production in our nation's many environmentally critical areas, and protect our oceans from oil spills and the dumping of toxic and radioactive waste. the president and vice president announced an historic partnership with the big three american automakers to develop the technology to produce cars up to three times more fuel efficient than those made today -- cleaner cars for a cleaner environment. we will continue to support responsible recycling, and encourage energy efficiency that makes our economy more efficient and less reliant on foreign oil. we believe that investments in better mass transit, cleaner cars, and renewable energy sources are good for the environment and good for the economy. after years in which republicans neglected the global environment, the clinton administration has made america a leader in the fight to meet environmental challenges that transcend national borders and require global cooperation. the clinton-gore administration led the world in calling for a global ban on ocean-dumping of low-level radioactive waste and for a legally binding treaty to phase out persistent organic pollutants such as ddt and pcbs. we will seek a strong international agreement to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. we are committed to preserving the planet's biodiversity, repairing the depleted ozone layer. and working with other nations to stabilize population growth. democrats recognize that sustainable development is the key to protecting the environment and promoting economic growth. that is why the clinton-gore administration has reformed our foreign aid programs to focus on sustainable development. at home, democrats know that sound economic development means sound environmental protection. the american community. today's democratic party knows that when america is divided we will likely fail, but when america is united we will always prevail. americans will always have differences, and when we reach across those differences, we are stronger for it. and we share an abiding set of values that define us as americans. our task is to draw strength from both -- from our great diversity and our constant values -- to fashion the future we want for our children. fighting discrimination and protecting civil rights. today's democratic party knows we must renew our efforts to stamp out discrimination and hatred of every kind, wherever and whenever we see it. we deplore the recent wave of burnings that has targeted african-american churches in the south, as well as other houses of worship across the country, and we have established a special task force to help local communities catch and prosecute those responsible, prevent further arsons, and rebuild their churches. we must remember we do not have an american to waste. we continue to lead the fight to end discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, age, ethnicity, disability, and sexual orientation. the democratic party has always supported the equal rights amendment, and we are committed to ensuring full equality for women. we support continued efforts, like the employment non-discrimination act, to end discrimination against gay men and lesbians and further their full inclusion in the life of the nation. over the last four years, president clinton and the democrats have worked aggressively to enforce the letter and spirit of civil rights law. the president and vice president remain committed to an administration that looks like america, and we are proud of the administration's extraordinary judicial appointments -- they are both more diverse and more qualified than any previous administration. we know there is still more we can do to ensure equal opportunity for all americans, so all people willing to work hard can build a strong future. president clinton has led the way in reforming affirmative action so that it works, it is improved, and promotes opportunity, but does not accidentally hold others back in the process. when it comes to affirmative action, we should mend it, not end it. religious freedom. today's democratic party understands that all americans have a right to express their faith. the constitution prohibits the state establishment of religion, and it protects the free exercise of religion. the president fought for and signed the religious freedom restoration act, to reaffirm the great protection the constitution gives to religious expression, and to recognize the historic role people of faith have played in america. americans have a right to express their love of god in public, and we applaud the president's work to ensure that children are not denied private religious expression in school. whenever the religious rights of our children -- or any american -- are threatened, we will stand against it. responsibility to our community and our country. today's democratic party believes every american has a duty and a responsibility to give something back to their community and their country. in the past three years, , americans have performed national service as part of the americorps program president clinton and the democrats fought so hard to create -- and we commend senator grassley and other republicans who joined a bipartisan effort to preserve americorps when speaker gingrich's house tried to kill it. we applaud the american spirit of voluntarism and charity. as we balance the budget, we must work even harder in our own lives to live up to the duties we owe one another. we must shrink the government, but we cannot shrink from our challenges. we believe every school and college in america should make service a part of its basic ethic, and we want to expand national service by helping communities give scholarships to high school students for community service. we challenge americans in all walks of life to make a new commitment to taking responsibility for themselves, their families, their communities, and their country. if we do our job, we will make the next american century as great as each one that has come before it. we will enter the 21st century with the american dream alive for all, with america still the world's strongest force for peace and freedom, and with the american community coming together, enriched by our diversity and stronger than ever. america's best days lie ahead, as we renew our historic pledge to uphold and advance the promise of america -- one nation, under god, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.","['meeting', 'america', 'challenges', 'protecting', 'america', 'values',
