tion that the great American dream of life, liberty
and pursuit of happiness, will be realized only
under Socialism, a society in which the means of
production will be collectively owned and oper-
ated under a government led by the working
class.’ Only such a society can forever banish war,
poverty and race hatred. Only in such a society
can there be the full realization of the dignity of
man and the full development of the individual.
Only such a society can permanently protect the
integrity of the home and family. Only a Socialist
society can realize in life the vision of the brother-
hood of man.
Fellow Americans:

We live in times of great danger.

Fascism and war now threaten our country.

But the common people of America, and in
the first place the working people, can defeat
these dangers. They can turn our country to
the path of democracy and peace, to the path
of social progress.

The 1948 elections will help decide which
way America will go.

Your united action in this election, your de-
termined defense of your rights, can become
powerful forces for peace and progress. The
future of our country is in your hands.

Democratic Party Platform 1948

The Democratic Party adopts this platform in
the conviction that the destiny of the United

States is to provide leadership in the world to--

ward a realization of the Four Freedoms.

We chart our future course as we charted our
course under the leadership of Franklin D. Roose-
velt and Harry S. Truman in the abiding belief
that democracy—when dedicated to the service of
all and not to a privileged few—proves its superi-
ority over all other forms of government.

Our party record of the past is assurance of its
policies and performance in the future.

Ours is the party which was entrusted with re-
sponsibility when twelve years of Republican neg-
lect had blighted the hopes of mankind, had
squandered the fruits of prosperity and had
‘plunged us into the depths of depression and
despair. .

Ours is the party which rebuilt a shattered
economy, rescued our banking system, revived

our agriculture, reinvigorated our industry, gave
labor strength and security, and led the American
people to the broadest prosperity in our history.

Ours is the party which introduced the spirit
of humanity into our law, as we outlawed. child
labor and the sweatshop, insured bank deposits,
protected millions of home-owners and farmers
from foreclosure, and established national social
security, ;

Ours is the party under which this nation before
Pearl Harbor gave aid and strength to those
countries which were holding back the Nazi and
Fascist tide.

Ours is the party which stood at the helm and
led the nation to victory in the war.

Ours is the party which, during the war, pre-
pared for peace so well that when peace came
reconversion promptly led to the greatest produc-
tion and employment in this nation’s life.

Ours is the party under whose leadership farm
owners’ income in this nation increased from less
than $2.5 billions in 1933 to more than, $18 bil-
lions in 1947; independent business and profes-
sional income increased from less than $8 billions
in 1938 to more than $22 billions in 1947; em-
ployees’ earnings increased from $29 billions in
1983 to more than 128 billions in 1947; and em-
ployment grew from 39 million jobs in 1933 to
a record of 60 million jobs in 1947.

Ours is the party under which the framework
of the world. organization for peace and justice
was formulated and created.

Ours is the party under which were conceived
the instruments. for resisting Communist aggres-
sion and for rebuilding the economic. strength of
the democratic countries of Europe and Asia—
the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. They
are the materials with which we must build ‘the
peace. ,

Ours is the party which first proclaimed that
the actions and policies of this nation in the for-
eign field are matters of national. and not just
party concern. We shall go forward on the course
charted by President Roosevelt and President Tru-
man and the other leaders of Democracy.

We reject the principle—which we have always
rejected, but which the Republican 80th Congress
enthusiastically accepted—that government exists
for the benefit of the privileged few.

To serve the interests of all and not the few; to
assure a world in which peace and justice can


prevail; to achieve security, full production, and
full employment—this is our platform.

Our ForeiIcn Pouicy

Wre declared in 1944 that the imperative duty
of the United States was to wage the war to final
triumph and to join with the other United Na-
tions in the establishment of an international
organization for the prevention of aggression and
the maintenance of international peace and se-
curity.

Under Democratic ‘leadership, those pledges
were gloriously redeemed.

When the United States was treacherously and
savagely attacked, our great Democratic President,
Franklin D. Roosevelt, and a Democratic Congress
preserved the nation’s honor, and with high cour-
age and with the invincible might of the Ameri-
can people, the challenge was accepted. Under
his inspiring leadership, the nation created the
greatest army that ever assembled under the flag,
the mightiest air force, the most powerful navy
on the globe, and the largest merchant marine in
_ the world.

The nation’s gallant sons on land, on sea, and
in the air, ended the war in complete and over-
whelming triumph. - Armed aggression against
peaceful peoples was resisted and crushed. Ar-
rogant and powerful war lords were vanquished
and forced to unconditional surrender.

Before the end of the war the Democratic ad-
ministration turned to the task of establishing
measures for peace and the prevention of aggres-
sion and the threat of another war. Under the
leadership of a Democratic President and _ his
Secretary of State, the United Nations was organ-
ized at San Francisco. The charter was ratified
by an overwhelming vote of the Senate. We sup-
port the United Nations fully and we pledge our
whole-hearted aid toward its growth and develop-
ment. We will continue to lead the way toward
curtailment of the use of the veto. We shall favor
_such amenglments and modifications of the charter
as experience may justify. We will continue our
efforts toward the establishment of an interna-

tional armed force to aid its authority. We advo-
cate the grant of a loan to the United Nations
recommended by the President, but denied by the
Republican Congress, for. the construction of the
United Nations headquarters in this country.

We pledge our best endeavors to conclide

CAMPAIGN OF 1948 431

treaties of peace with our former enemies. Al-

ready treaties have been made with Italy, Hun- |

gary, Bulgaria and Rumania. We shall strive to
conclude treaties with the remaining enemy states,
based on justice and with guarantees against the
revival of aggression, and for the preservation of
peace:

We advocate the maintance of an adequate
Army, Navy and Air Force to protect the nation’s
vital interests and to assure our security against
aggression. ~ ‘

We advocate the effective international control
of weapons of mass destruction, including the
atomic bomb, and we approve continued and
vigorous efforts’ within the United Nations. to
bring about the ‘successful: consummation of the
proposals which our Government has advanced.

The adoption of these proposals would be a
vital and most important step toward safe and
effective world disarmament and world peace
under a_ strengthened: United Nations which
would then truly constitute a more effective
parliament of the world’s peoples.

Under the leadership of a Democratic Presi-
dent, the United States has demonstrated its
friendship for other peace-loving nations and its
support of their freedom and independence. Un-
der the Truman doctrine vital aid has been ex-
tended to China, to Greece, and to Turkey. Un-
der the Marshall Plan generous sums have been
provided for the relief and rehabilitation of Euro-
pean nations striving to rebuild their economy
and to secure and strengthen their safety and
freedom. The Republican leadership in the House
of Representatives, by its votes in the 80th Con-
gress, has shown its reluctance to provide funds
to support this program, the greatest move for
peace and recovery made since the end of World
War II.

We pledge a sound, humanitarian administra-
tion of the Marshall Plan. .

We pledge support not only for these princi-
ples—we pledge further that we will not with-
hold necessary funds by which these principles
can be achieved. Therefore, we pledge that we
will implement with appropriations the commit-
ments which are made in this nation’s foreign
program.

We pledge ourselves to restore the Reciprocal
Trade Agreements program formulated in 1934
by Secretary of State Cordell Hull and operated


432 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

successfully for 14 years—until crippled by the
Republican 80th Congress. Further, we strongly
endorse our country’s adherence to the Interna-
tional Trade Organization.

A great Democratic President established the
Good Neighbor Policy toward the nations of the
Western Hemisphere. The Act of Chapultepec
was negotiated at Mexico City under Democratic
leadership. It was carried forward in the Western
_Hemisphere defense pact concluded at Rio de
Janeiro, which implemented the Monroe Doctrine
and united the Western Hemisphere in behalf of
peace.

We pledge continued economic cooperation
with the countries of the Western Hemisphere.
We pledge continued support of regional arrange-
ments within the United Nations Charter, such
as the Inter-American Regional Pact and the de-
. veloping Western European Union.

President Truman, by granting immediate rec-
ognition to Israel, led the world in extending
friendship and welcome to a people who have
long sought and justly deserve freedom and inde-
pendence.

We pledge full recognition to the State of
Israel. We affirm our pride that the United States
under the leadership of President Truman played
a leading role in the adoption of the resolution
of November 29, 1947, by the United Nations
General Assembly for the creation of a Jewish
State.

We approve the claims of the State of Israel
to the boundaries set forth in the United Nations
resolution of November 29th and consider that
modifications thereof should be made only if
fully acceptable to the State of Israel.

We look forward to the admission of the State
of Israel to the United Nations and its full partici-
pation in the international community of nations.
We pledge appropriate aid to the State of Israel
in developing its economy and resources.

We favor the revision of the arms embargo to
accord to the State of Israel the right of self-
defense. We pledge ourselves to work for the
modification of any resolution of the United Na-
tions to the extent that it may prevent any such
revision.

We continue to support, within the framework
of the United Nations, the internationalization of
Jerusalem and the protection of the Holy Places
in Palestine.

The United States has: traditionally been in
sympathy with the efforts of subjugated countries
to attain their independence, and to establish a
democratic form of government. Poland is an out-
standing example. After a century and a half of
subjugation, it was resurrected after the first
World War by our great Democratic President,
Woodrow Wilson. We look forward to develop-
ment of these countries as prosperous, free, and
democratic fellow members of the United Nations.

Our Domestic PoLicies

The Republican 80th Congress is directly re-
sponsible for the existing and ever increasing high
cost of living. It cannot dodge that responsibility.
Unless the Republican candidates are defeated
in the approaching elections, their mistaken poli-
cies will impose greater hardships and suffering
on large numbers of the American people. Ade-
quate food, clothing and shelter—the bare necessi-
ties of life—are: becoming too expensive for the
average wage earner and the prospects are more
frightening each day. The Republican 80th
Congress has lacked the courage to face this vital
problem.

We shall curb the Republican inflation. We
shall put a halt to the disastrous price rises which
have come as a result of the failure of the Re-
publican 80th Congress to take effective action on
President Truman’s recommendations, setting forth
a comprehensive program to control the high cost
of living.

We shall enact comprehensive housing legisla-
tion, including provisions for slum clearance and
low-rent housing projects initiated by local agen-
cies. This nation is shamed by the failure of the
Republican 80th Congress to pass the vitally
needed general housing legislation as recom-
mended by the President. Adequate housing will
end the need for rent contro]. Until then, it must
be continued.

We pledge the continued maintenance of those
sound fiscal policies which under Democratic
leadership have brought about.a balanced budget
and reduction of the public debt by $28 billion
since the close of the war.

We favor the reduction of taxes, whenever it
is possible to do so without unbalancing the
nation’s economy, by giving a full measure of
relief to those millions of low-income families on |
whom the wartime burden of taxation fell most


heavily. The form of tax reduction adopted by
the Republican 80th Congress gave relief to those
who need it least and ignored those who need it
most.

We shall endeavor to remove tax inequities and
to continue to reduce the public debt.

We are opposed to the imposition of a general
federal sales tax.

We advocate the repeal of the Taft-Hartley
Act. It was enacted by the Republican 80th Con-
gress over the President’s veto. That act was
proposed with the promise that it would secure
“the legitimate rights of both employees and
employers in their relations affecting commerce.”.
It has failed. The number of labor-management
disputes has increased. The number of cases be-
fore the National Labor Relations Board has more
than doubled since the Act was passed, and
efficient and prompt administration is becoming
more and more difficult. It has encouraged liti-
gation in labor disputes and undermined the estab-
lished American policy of collective bargaining.
Recent decisions by the courts prove that the
Act was so poorly drawn that its application is
uncertain, and that it is probably, in some pro-
visions, unconstitutional. ,

We advocate such legislation as is desirable to
‘establish a just body of rules to assure free and
effective collective bargaining, to determine, in
the public interest, the rights of employees and
employers, to reduce to a minimum their conflict
of .interests, and to enable unions to keep their
membership free from communistic influences.

We urge that the Department of Labor be re-
built and strengthened, restoring to it the units,
ineluding the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service and the United States Employment Serv-
ice, which properly belong to it, and which the
Republican 80th Congress stripped from it over
the veto of President Truman. We urge that the
Department’s facilities for collecting and dissemi-
nating economic information be expanded, and
that a Labor Education Extension Service be
established in the Department of Labor.

We favor the extension of the coverage of the
Fair Labor Standards Act as recommended by
President Truman, and the adoption of a minimum
wage of at least 75 cents an hour in place of the
present obsolete and inadequate minimum of 40
cents 2n hour.

We favor legislation assuring that the workers

CAMPAIGN OF 1948 433

of our nation receive equal pay for equal work,
regardless of sex.

We favor the extension of the Social Security
program established under Democratic leadership,
to provide additional protection against the haz-
ards of old age, disability, disease or death. We
believe that this program should include:

Increases in old-age and survivors’ insurance
benefits by at least 50 percent, and reduction of
the eligibility age for women from 65 to 60 years;
extension of old-age and survivors’ and unemploy-
ment insurance to all workers not now covered;
insurance against loss of earnings on account of
illness or disability; improved public assistance for
the needy.

We favor the enactment of a national health
program for expanded medical research, medical
education, and hospitals and clinics.

We will continue our efforts to aid the blind
and other handicapped persons to become self-
supporting. -

We will continue our efforts to expand maternal
care, improve the health of the nation’s children,
and reduce juvenile delinquency.

We approve the purposes of the Mental Health
Act and we favor such appropriations as may be
necessary to make it effective.

We advocate federal aid for education adminis-
tered by and under the control of the states. We
vigorously support the authorization, which was
so shockingly ignored by the. Republican 80th
Congress, for the appropriation of $300 million

as a beginning of Federal aid to the states to assist —

them in meeting the present educational needs.
We insist upon the right of every American child
to obtain a good education.

The nation can never discharge its debt to its
millions of war veterans. We pledge ourselves to
the continuance and improvement of our national

‘program of, benefits for veterans and_ their

families.

We are proud of the sound and comprehensive
program conceived, developed and administered
under Democratic leadership, including the GI
Bill of Rights, which has proved beneficial to
many millions. ,

The level of veterans’ benefits must be con-
stantly re-examined in the light of the decline in
the purchasing power of the dollar brought about
by. inflation.

Employment and economic security must be

afforded all veterans.
housing for veterans at prices they can afford to
pay.

The disabled veteran must be provided with
medical care and hospitalization of the highest
possible standard.

We pledge our efforts to maintain continued
farm prosperity, improvement of the standard of
living and the working conditions of the farmer,
and to preserve the family-size farm.

Specifically, we favor'a permanent system of
flexible price supports for agricultural products,
to maintain farm income on a parity with farm
operating costs; an intensified soil conservation
program; an extended crop insurance program; im-
provement of methods of distributing agricultural
products; development and maintenance of stable
export markets; adequate financing for the school
lunch program; the use of agricultural surpluses
to improve the diet of low-income families in case
of need; continued expansion of the rural electrifi-
cation program; strengthening of all agricultural
credit programs; intensified research to improve
agricultural practices, and to find new uses for
farm products.

We strongly urge the continuance of maximum
farmer participation in all these programs.

We favor the repeal of the discriminatory taxes
on the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine.

We will encourage farm cooperatives and op-
pose any revision of federal law designed to cur-
tail their most effective functioning as a means of
achieving economy, stability and security for
American agriculture.

We favor provisions under which our fishery
resources and industry will be afforded the bene-
fits that will result from more scientific research
and exploration.

We recognize the importance of ‘small business
in a sound American economy. It must be pro-

tected against unfair discrimination and monopoly,

and be given equal opnortunities with competing
enterprises to expand its capital structure.
We favor non-discriminatory transportation

charges and declare for the early correction of
inequalities in such charges.

We pledge the continued full and unified re-
gional development of the water, mineral, and
other natural resources of the nation, recognizing
that the progress already achieved under the
initiative of the Democratic Party in the arid and

We pledge a program of -

semi-arid states of the West, as well as in the
Tennessee Valley, is only an indication of still
greater results which can be accomplished. Our
natural resources are the heritage of all our people
and must not be permitted to become the private
preserves of monopoly,

The irrigation of .arid land, the establishment
of new, independent, competitive business and
the stimulation of new industrial opportunities for
all of our people depends upon the development
and transmission of electric energy in accordance
with the program and the projects so successfully
launched under Democratic auspices during the
past sixteen years.

We favor acceleration of the Federal Recla-
mation Program, the maximum beneficial use of
water in the several states for: irrigation and
domestic supply. In this connection, we propose
the establishment and maintenance of new family-
size farms for veterans and others seeking settle-
ment opportunities, the development of hydro-
electric power and its widespread distribution
over publicly owned transmission lines to assure
benefits to the water users in financing irrigation
projects, and to the power users for domestic and
industrial purposes, with preference to public
agencies and R.E.A. cooperatives.

These are the aims of the Democratic Party
which in the future, as in the past, will place the
interest of the people as individual citizens first.

We ‘will continue to improve the navigable

waterways and harbors of the nation.

We pledge to continue the policy initiated’ by
the Democratic Party of adequate appropriations
for flood control for the protection of life and
property.

In addition to practicing false economy on flood.
control, the Republican-controlled 80th Congress .
was so cruel as even to deny emergency federal
funds for the relief of individuals and municipali-
ties victimized by recent great floods, tornadoes
and other disasters.

We shall expand our programs for forestation,
for the improvement of grazing lands, public and
private, for the stockpiling of strategic minerals
and the encouragement of a sound. domestic
mining industry. We shall carry forward experi-
ments for the broader utilization of mineral re-
sources in the highly beneficial manner already
demonstrated in the program for the manufacture
of synthetic liquid fuel from our vast deposits of

\


coal and oil shale and from our agricultural re-
sources.

We pledge an intensive enforcement of the anti-
trust laws, with adequate appropriations.

We advocate the strengthening of existing anti-
trust laws by closing the gaps which experience
has shown have been used to promote concentra-
tion of economic power.

We pledge a positive program to promote
competitive business and to foster the develop-
rent of independent trade and commerce.

We support the right of free enterprise and the
right of all persons to work together in coopera-
tives and other democratic associations for the
purpose of carrying out any proper business opera-
tions free from any arbitrary and discriminatory
restrictions.

The Democratic Party is responsible for the
great civil rights gains made in recent years in
eliminating unfair and illegal discrimination based
on race, creed or color.

The Democratic Party commits itself to con-
tinuing its efforts to eradicate all racial, religious
and economic discrimination. :

We again state our belief that racial and re-
ligious minorities must have the right to live, the
right to work, the right to vote, the full and equal
protection of the laws, on a basis of equality with
all citizens as guaranteed by the Constitution.

We highly commend President Harry S. Tru-
man for his courageous stand on the issue-of civil
rights.

We call upon the Congress to support our
President in guaranteeing these basic and funda-
mental American Principles: (1) the right of full
and equal political participation; (2) the right to
equal opportunity of employment; (3) the right
of security of person; (4) and the right of equal
treatment’ in the service and defense of our
nation.! .

We pledge ourselves to legislation to admit a
minimum of 400,000 displaced persons. found
eligible for United States citizenship without dis-
crimination as to race or religion. We condemn

Congress in passing an inadequate and bigoted
bill for this purpose, which law imposes un-
American restrictions based on race and religion

‘upon such admissions.

We urge immediate statehood for Hawaii and
Alaska; immediate determination by the people
of Puerto Rico as to their form of government and
their ultimate status with respect to the United
States; and the maximum degree of local self-
government for the Virgin Islands, Guam and
Samoa.

We recommend to Congress the submission of
a constitutional amendment on equal rights for
women.

We favor the extension of the right of suffrage
to the people of the District.of Columbia.

We pledge adherence to the principle cf non-
partisan civilian administration of atomic energy,
and the development of atomic energy for peace-
ful purposes through free scientific inquiry for the
benefit of all the people.

We urge the vigorous promotion of wor ld-wide
freedom in. the gathering and dissemination of
news by press, radio, motion pictures, newsreels
and television, with complete confidence that an
informed people will determine wisely the course
of domestic and foreign policy.

We believe the primary step. toward the
achievement of world-wide freedom is access by
all peoples to the facts and the truth. To that
end, we will encourage the greatest possible vigor
on the part of the United Nations Commission on ,
Human Rights and the United Nations Economic
and Social Council to establish the foundations
on which freedom can exist in every nation.

We deplore the repeated attempts of Republi-
cans in the 80th Congress to impose thought con-

’ trol upon the American people and to encroach

on the freedom of speech and press.

We pledge the early establishment of a national
science foundation under principles which will
guarantee the most effective utilization of public
and private research facilities.

We will continue our efforts to improve and
strengthen our federal civil service, and provide
adequate compensation.

We will continue to maintain an adequate
American merchant marine.

We condemn Communism and other forms of
totalitarianism and their destructive activity over-
seas and at home. We shall continue to build firm

defenses against Communism by strengthening
the economic and social structure of our own
democracy. We reiterate our pledge to expose
and prosecute treasonable activities of anti-demo-
cratic and un-American organizations which would
sap our strength, paralyze our will to defend our-
selves, and destroy our unity, inciting race against
race, class against class, and the people against
free institutions. ,

We shall continue vigorously to enforce the
laws against subversive activities, observing at all
times the constitutional guarantees which protect
free speech, the free press and honest political
activity. We shall strengthen our laws against
subversion to the full extent necessary, protecting
at all times our traditional individual freedoms.

We recognize that the United States has be-
come the principal protector of the free world.
The free peoples of the world look to us for sup-
port in maintaining their freedoms. If we falter
in our leadership, we may endanger the peace of
the world—and we shall surely endanger the wel-
fare of our own nation. For these reasons it is
imperative that we maintain our military strength
until world peace with justice is secure. Under
the leadership of President Truman, our military
departments have been united and our Govern-
ment organization for the national defense greatly
strengthened. We pledge to maintain adequate
military strength, based on these improvements,
sufficient to fulfill our responsibilities in occupation
zones, defend our national interests, and to bolster
those free nations resisting Communist aggression.

This is our platform. These are our principles.
They form a political and economic policy which
has guided our party and our nation.

The American people know these principles
well. Under them, we have enjoyed greater se-
curity, greater prosperity, and more effective
world leadership than ever before.

Under them and with the guidance of Divine
Providence we can proceed to higher levels of
prosperity and security; we can advance to a
better life at home; we can continue our leader-
ship in the world with ever-growing prospects for
lasting peace.

Progressive Party Platform, 1948

PREAMBLE

Three years after the end of the second world

war, the drums are beating for a third. Civil
liberties are being destroyed. Millions cry out
for relief from unbearably high prices. The
American way of life is in danger.
' The root cause of this crisis is Big Business
control of our economy and government.

With toil and enterprise the American people
have created from their rich resources the ‘world’s

‘ greatest productive machine. This machine no

longer belongs to the people. Its ownership is
concentrated in the hands of a few and its prod-

“uct used for their enrichment.

Never before have so few owned so much at
the expense of so many. .

Ten years ago Franklin Delano Roosevelt
warned: “The liberty of a democracy is not safe
if the people tolerate the growth of private power
to a point where it becomes stronger than their
democratic state. That, in its essence, is fascism.”

Today that private power has constituted itself
an invisible government which pulls the strings
of its puppet Republican and Democratic parties.
Two sets of candidates compete for votes under
the outworn emblems of the old parties. But
both represent a single program—a program of
monopoly profits through war preparations, lower
living standards, and suppression of dissent.

For generations the common man of America
has resisted this concentration of economic and
political power in the hands of a few. The great-
est of America’s political leaders have led the
people into battle against the money power, the
railroads, the trusts, the economic royalists.

We of the Progressive Party are the present-
day descendants of these people’s movements and
fighting leaders. We are the political heirs of
Jefferson, Jackson and Lincoln — of Frederick
Douglass, Altgeld and Debs—of “Fighting Bob”
LaFollette, George Norris, and Franklin Roose-
velt.

Throughout our history new parties have arisen

when the old parties have betrayed the people.

As Jefferson headed a new party to defeat the
reactionaries of his day, and as Lincoln led a new
party to victory over the slave-owners, so today
the people, inspired and led by Henry Wallace,
have created a new party to secure peace, free-

‘dom, and abundance.

stitution of the United States set forth all funda-",31578,5069,"national party platforms tion that the great american dream of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, will be realized only under

industry, gave labor strength and security, and led the american people to the broadest prosperity in our history. ours is the party which introduced the spirit of humanity into our law, as we outlawed. child labor and the sweatshop, insured bank deposits, protected millions of home-owners and farmers from foreclosure, and established national social security, ; ours is the party under which this nation before pearl harbor gave aid and strength to those countries which were holding back the nazi and fascist tide. ours is the party which stood at the helm and led the nation to victory in the war. ours is the party which, during the war, pre- pared for peace so well that when peace came reconversion promptly led to the greatest produc- tion and employment in this nation’s life. ours is the party under whose leadership farm owners’ income in this nation increased from less than $. billions in to more than, $ bil- lions in ; independent business and profes- sional income increased from less than $ billions in to more than $ billions in ; em- ployees’ earnings increased from $ billions in to more than billions in ; and em- ployment grew from million jobs in to a record of million jobs in . ours is the party under which the framework of the world. organization for peace and justice was formulated and created. ours is the party under which were conceived the instruments. for resisting communist aggres- sion and for rebuilding the economic. strength of the democratic countries of europe and asia— the truman doctrine and the marshall plan. they are the materials with which we must build ‘the peace. , ours is the party which first proclaimed that the actions and policies of this nation in the for- eign field are matters of national. and not just party concern. we shall go forward on the course charted by president roosevelt and president tru- man and the other leaders of democracy. we reject the principle—which we have always rejected, but which the republican 80th congress enthusiastically accepted—that government exists for the benefit of the privileged few. to serve the interests of all and not the few; to assure a world in which peace and justice can prevail; to achieve security, full production, and full employment—this is our platform. our foreiicn pouicy wre declared in that the imperative duty of the united states was to wage the war to final triumph and to join with the other united na- tions in the establishment of an international organization for the prevention of aggression and the maintenance of international peace and se- curity. under democratic ‘leadership, those pledges were gloriously redeemed. when the united states was treacherously and savagely attacked, our great democratic president, franklin d. roosevelt, and a democratic congress preserved the nation’s honor, and with high cour- age and with the invincible might of the ameri- can people, the challenge was accepted. under his inspiring leadership, the nation created the greatest army that ever assembled under the flag, the mightiest air force, the most powerful navy on the globe, and the largest merchant marine in _ the world. the nation’s gallant sons on land, on sea, and in the air, ended the war in complete and over- whelming triumph. - armed aggression against peaceful peoples was resisted and crushed. ar- rogant and powerful war lords were vanquished and forced to unconditional surrender. before the end of the war the democratic ad- ministration turned to the task of establishing measures for peace and the prevention of aggres- sion and the threat of another war. under the leadership of a democratic president and _ his secretary of state, the united nations was organ- ized at san francisco. the charter was ratified by an overwhelming vote of the senate. we sup- port the united nations fully and we pledge our whole-hearted aid toward its growth and develop- ment. we will continue to lead the way toward curtailment of the use of the veto. we shall favor _such amenglments and modifications of the charter as experience may justify. we will continue our efforts toward the establishment of an interna- tional armed force to aid its authority. we advo- cate the grant of a loan to the united nations recommended by the president, but denied by the republican congress, for. the construction of the united nations headquarters in this country. we pledge our best endeavors to conclide campaign of treaties of peace with our former enemies. al- ready treaties have been made with italy, hun- | gary, bulgaria and rumania. we shall strive to conclude treaties with the remaining enemy states, based on justice and with guarantees against the revival of aggression, and for the preservation of peace: we advocate the maintance of an adequate army, navy and air force to protect the nation’s vital interests and to assure our security against aggression. ~ ‘ we advocate the effective international control of weapons of mass destruction, including the atomic bomb, and we approve continued and vigorous efforts’ within the united nations. to bring about the ‘successful: consummation of the proposals which our government has advanced. the adoption of these proposals would be a vital and most important step toward safe and effective world disarmament and world peace under a_ strengthened: united nations which would then truly constitute a more effective parliament of the world’s peoples. under the leadership of a democratic presi- dent, the united states has demonstrated its friendship for other peace-loving nations and its support of their freedom and independence. un- der the truman doctrine vital aid has been ex- tended to china, to greece, and to turkey. un- der the marshall plan generous sums have been provided for the relief and rehabilitation of euro- pean nations striving to rebuild their economy and to secure and strengthen their safety and freedom. the republican leadership in the house of representatives, by its votes in the 80th con- gress, has shown its reluctance to provide funds to support this program, the greatest move for peace and recovery made since the end of world war ii. we pledge a sound, humanitarian administra- tion of the marshall plan. . we pledge support not only for these princi- ples—we pledge further that we will not with- hold necessary funds by which these principles can be achieved. therefore, we pledge that we will implement with appropriations the commit- ments which are made in this nation’s foreign program. we pledge ourselves to restore the reciprocal trade agreements program formulated in by secretary of state cordell hull and operated national party platforms successfully for years—until crippled by the republican 80th congress. further, we strongly endorse our country’s adherence to the interna- tional trade organization. a great democratic president established the good neighbor policy toward the nations of the western hemisphere. the act of chapultepec was negotiated at mexico city under democratic leadership. it was carried forward in the western _hemisphere defense pact concluded at rio de janeiro, which implemented the monroe doctrine and united the western hemisphere in behalf of peace. we pledge continued economic cooperation with the countries of the western hemisphere. we pledge continued support of regional arrange- ments within the united nations charter, such as the inter-american regional pact and the de- . veloping western european union. president truman, by granting immediate rec- ognition to israel, led the world in extending friendship and welcome to a people who have long sought and justly deserve freedom and inde- pendence. we pledge full recognition to the state of israel. we affirm our pride that the united states under the leadership of president truman played a leading role in the adoption of the resolution of november , , by the united nations general assembly for the creation of a jewish state. we approve the claims of the state of israel to the boundaries set forth in the united nations resolution of november 29th and consider that modifications thereof should be made only if fully acceptable to the state of israel. we look forward to the admission of the state of israel to the united nations and its full partici- pation in the international community of nations. we pledge appropriate aid to the state of israel in developing its economy and resources. we favor the revision of the arms embargo to accord to the state of israel the right of self- defense. we pledge ourselves to work for the modification of any resolution of the united na- tions to the extent that it may prevent any such revision. we continue to support, within the framework of the united nations, the internationalization of jerusalem and the protection of the holy places in palestine. the united states has: traditionally been in sympathy with the efforts of subjugated countries to attain their independence, and to establish a democratic form of government. poland is an out- standing example. after a century and a half of subjugation, it was resurrected after the first world war by our great democratic president, woodrow wilson. we look forward to develop- ment of these countries as prosperous, free, and democratic fellow members of the united nations. our domestic policies the republican 80th congress is directly re- sponsible for the existing and ever increasing high cost of living. it cannot dodge that responsibility. unless the republican candidates are defeated in the approaching elections, their mistaken poli- cies will impose greater hardships and suffering on large numbers of the american people. ade- quate food, clothing and shelter—the bare necessi- ties of life—are: becoming too expensive for the average wage earner and the prospects are more frightening each day. the republican 80th congress has lacked the courage to face this vital problem. we shall curb the republican inflation. we shall put a halt to the disastrous price rises which have come as a result of the failure of the re- publican 80th congress to take effective action on president truman’s recommendations, setting forth a comprehensive program to control the high cost of living. we shall enact comprehensive housing legisla- tion, including provisions for slum clearance and low-rent housing projects initiated by local agen- cies. this nation is shamed by the failure of the republican 80th congress to pass the vitally needed general housing legislation as recom- mended by the president. adequate housing will end the need for rent contro]. until then, it must be continued. we pledge the continued maintenance of those sound fiscal policies which under democratic leadership have brought about.a balanced budget and reduction of the public debt by $ billion since the close of the war. we favor the reduction of taxes, whenever it is possible to do so without unbalancing the nation’s economy, by giving a full measure of relief to those millions of low-income families on | whom the wartime burden of taxation fell most heavily. the form of tax reduction adopted by the republican 80th congress gave relief to those who need it least and ignored those who need it most. we shall endeavor to remove tax inequities and to continue to reduce the public debt. we are opposed to the imposition of a general federal sales tax. we advocate the repeal of the taft-hartley act. it was enacted by the republican 80th con- gress over the president’s veto. that act was proposed with the promise that it would secure “the legitimate rights of both employees and employers in their relations affecting commerce.”. it has failed. the number of labor-management disputes has increased. the number of cases be- fore the national labor relations board has more than doubled since the act was passed, and efficient and prompt administration is becoming more and more difficult. it has encouraged liti- gation in labor disputes and undermined the estab- lished american policy of collective bargaining. recent decisions by the courts prove that the act was so poorly drawn that its application is uncertain, and that it is probably, in some pro- visions, unconstitutional. , we advocate such legislation as is desirable to ‘establish a just body of rules to assure free and effective collective bargaining, to determine, in the public interest, the rights of employees and employers, to reduce to a minimum their conflict of .interests, and to enable unions to keep their membership free from communistic influences. we urge that the department of labor be re- built and strengthened, restoring to it the units, ineluding the federal mediation and conciliation service and the united states employment serv- ice, which properly belong to it, and which the republican 80th congress stripped from it over the veto of president truman. we urge that the department’s facilities for collecting and dissemi- nating economic information be expanded, and that a labor education extension service be established in the department of labor. we favor the extension of the coverage of the fair labor standards act as recommended by president truman, and the adoption of a minimum wage of at least cents an hour in place of the present obsolete and inadequate minimum of cents 2n hour. we favor legislation assuring that the workers campaign of of our nation receive equal pay for equal work, regardless of sex. we favor the extension of the social security program established under democratic leadership, to provide additional protection against the haz- ards of old age, disability, disease or death. we believe that this program should include: increases in old-age and survivors’ insurance benefits by at least percent, and reduction of the eligibility age for women from to years; extension of old-age and survivors’ and unemploy- ment insurance to all workers not now covered; insurance against loss of earnings on account of illness or disability; improved public assistance for the needy. we favor the enactment of a national health program for expanded medical research, medical education, and hospitals and clinics. we will continue our efforts to aid the blind and other handicapped persons to become self- supporting. - we will continue our efforts to expand maternal care, improve the health of the nation’s children, and reduce juvenile delinquency. we approve the purposes of the mental health act and we favor such appropriations as may be necessary to make it effective. we advocate federal aid for education adminis- tered by and under the control of the states. we vigorously support the authorization, which was so shockingly ignored by the. republican 80th congress, for the appropriation of $ million as a beginning of federal aid to the states to assist — them in meeting the present educational needs. we insist upon the right of every american child to obtain a good education. the nation can never discharge its debt to its millions of war veterans. we pledge ourselves to the continuance and improvement of our national ‘program of, benefits for veterans and_ their families. we are proud of the sound and comprehensive program conceived, developed and administered under democratic leadership, including the gi bill of rights, which has proved beneficial to many millions. , the level of veterans’ benefits must be con- stantly re-examined in the light of the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar brought about by. inflation. employment and economic security must be | arrests tms hea rat rrr sr! national party platforms. afforded all veterans. housing for veterans at prices they can afford to pay. the disabled veteran must be provided with medical care and hospitalization of the highest possible standard. we pledge our efforts to maintain continued farm prosperity, improvement of the standard of living and the working conditions of the farmer, and to preserve the family-size farm. specifically, we favor'a permanent system of flexible price supports for agricultural products, to maintain farm income on a parity with farm operating costs; an intensified soil conservation program; an extended crop insurance program; im- provement of methods of distributing agricultural products; development and maintenance of stable export markets; adequate financing for the school lunch program; the use of agricultural surpluses to improve the diet of low-income families in case of need; continued expansion of the rural electrifi- cation program; strengthening of all agricultural credit programs; intensified research to improve agricultural practices, and to find new uses for farm products. we strongly urge the continuance of maximum farmer participation in all these programs. we favor the repeal of the discriminatory taxes on the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine. we will encourage farm cooperatives and op- pose any revision of federal law designed to cur- tail their most effective functioning as a means of achieving economy, stability and security for american agriculture. we favor provisions under which our fishery resources and industry will be afforded the bene- fits that will result from more scientific research and exploration. we recognize the importance of ‘small business in a sound american economy. it must be pro- tected against unfair discrimination and monopoly, and be given equal opnortunities with competing enterprises to expand its capital structure. we favor non-discriminatory transportation charges and declare for the early correction of inequalities in such charges. we pledge the continued full and unified re- gional development of the water, mineral, and other natural resources of the nation, recognizing that the progress already achieved under the initiative of the democratic party in the arid and we pledge a program of - semi-arid states of the west, as well as in the tennessee valley, is only an indication of still greater results which can be accomplished. our natural resources are the heritage of all our people and must not be permitted to become the private preserves of monopoly, the irrigation of .arid land, the establishment of new, independent, competitive business and the stimulation of new industrial opportunities for all of our people depends upon the development and transmission of electric energy in accordance with the program and the projects so successfully launched under democratic auspices during the past sixteen years. we favor acceleration of the federal recla- mation program, the maximum beneficial use of water in the several states for: irrigation and domestic supply. in this connection, we propose the establishment and maintenance of new family- size farms for veterans and others seeking settle- ment opportunities, the development of hydro- electric power and its widespread distribution over publicly owned transmission lines to assure benefits to the water users in financing irrigation projects, and to the power users for domestic and industrial purposes, with preference to public agencies and r.e.a. cooperatives. these are the aims of the democratic party which in the future, as in the past, will place the interest of the people as individual citizens first. we ‘will continue to improve the navigable waterways and harbors of the nation. we pledge to continue the policy initiated’ by the democratic party of adequate appropriations for flood control for the protection of life and property. in addition to practicing false economy on flood. control, the republican-controlled 80th congress . was so cruel as even to deny emergency federal funds for the relief of individuals and municipali- ties victimized by recent great floods, tornadoes and other disasters. we shall expand our programs for forestation, for the improvement of grazing lands, public and private, for the stockpiling of strategic minerals and the encouragement of a sound. domestic mining industry. we shall carry forward experi- ments for the broader utilization of mineral re- sources in the highly beneficial manner already demonstrated in the program for the manufacture of synthetic liquid fuel from our vast deposits of \ coal and oil shale and from our agricultural re- sources. we pledge an intensive enforcement of the anti- trust laws, with adequate appropriations. we advocate the strengthening of existing anti- trust laws by closing the gaps which experience has shown have been used to promote concentra- tion of economic power. we pledge a positive program to promote competitive business and to foster the develop- rent of independent trade and commerce. we support the right of free enterprise and the right of all persons to work together in coopera- tives and other democratic associations for the purpose of carrying out any proper business opera- tions free from any arbitrary and discriminatory restrictions. the democratic party is responsible for the great civil rights gains made in recent years in eliminating unfair and illegal discrimination based on race, creed or color. the democratic party commits itself to con- tinuing its efforts to eradicate all racial, religious and economic discrimination. : we again state our belief that racial and re- ligious minorities must have the right to live, the right to work, the right to vote, the full and equal protection of the laws, on a basis of equality with all citizens as guaranteed by the constitution. we highly commend president harry s. tru- man for his courageous stand on the issue-of civil rights. we call upon the congress to support our president in guaranteeing these basic and funda- mental american principles: () the right of full and equal political participation; () the right to equal opportunity of employment; () the right of security of person; () and the right of equal treatment’ in the service and defense of our nation.! . we pledge ourselves to legislation to admit a minimum of , displaced persons. found eligible for united states citizenship without dis- crimination as to race or religion. we condemn the undemocratic action of the republican 80th 1when this platform was presented to the con- . vention, this section stated: “we again call upon.the congress to exert its full authority to the limit of its constitutional powers to assure and protect these rights.” the lest two paragraphs in the text above were inserted as an amendment to the platform by a vote of % to %. campaign of congress in passing an inadequate and bigoted bill for this purpose, which law imposes un- american restrictions based on race and religion ‘upon such admissions. we urge immediate statehood for hawaii and alaska; immediate determination by the people of puerto rico as to their form of government and their ultimate status with respect to the united states; and the maximum degree of local self- government for the virgin islands, guam and samoa. we recommend to congress the submission of a constitutional amendment on equal rights for women. we favor the extension of the right of suffrage to the people of the district.of columbia. we pledge adherence to the principle cf non- partisan civilian administration of atomic energy, and the development of atomic energy for peace- ful purposes through free scientific inquiry for the benefit of all the people. we urge the vigorous promotion of wor ld-wide freedom in. the gathering and dissemination of news by press, radio, motion pictures, newsreels and television, with complete confidence that an informed people will determine wisely the course of domestic and foreign policy. we believe the primary step. toward the achievement of world-wide freedom is access by all peoples to the facts and the truth. to that end, we will encourage the greatest possible vigor on the part of the united nations commission on , human rights and the united nations economic and social council to establish the foundations on which freedom can exist in every nation. we deplore the repeated attempts of republi- cans in the 80th congress to impose thought con- ’ trol upon the american people and to encroach on the freedom of speech and press. we pledge the early establishment of a national science foundation under principles which will guarantee the most effective utilization of public and private research facilities. we will continue our efforts to improve and strengthen our federal civil service, and provide adequate compensation. we will continue to maintain an adequate american merchant marine. we condemn communism and other forms of totalitarianism and their destructive activity over- seas and at home. we shall continue to build firm national party platforms defenses against communism by strengthening the economic and social structure of our own democracy. we reiterate our pledge to expose and prosecute treasonable activities of anti-demo- cratic and un-american organizations which would sap our strength, paralyze our will to defend our- selves, and destroy our unity, inciting race against race, class against class, and the people against free institutions. , we shall continue vigorously to enforce the laws against subversive activities, observing at all times the constitutional guarantees which protect free speech, the free press and honest political activity. we shall strengthen our laws against subversion to the full extent necessary, protecting at all times our traditional individual freedoms. we recognize that the united states has be- come the principal protector of the free world. the free peoples of the world look to us for sup- port in maintaining their freedoms. if we falter in our leadership, we may endanger the peace of the world—and we shall surely endanger the wel- fare of our own nation. for these reasons it is imperative that we maintain our military strength until world peace with justice is secure. under the leadership of president truman, our military departments have been united and our govern- ment organization for the national defense greatly strengthened. we pledge to maintain adequate military strength, based on these improvements, sufficient to fulfill our responsibilities in occupation zones, defend our national interests, and to bolster those free nations resisting communist aggression. this is our platform. these are our principles. they form a political and economic policy which has guided our party and our nation. the american people know these principles well. under them, we have enjoyed greater se- curity, greater prosperity, and more effective world leadership than ever before. under them and with the guidance of divine providence we can proceed to higher levels of prosperity and security; we can advance to a better life at home; we can continue our leader- ship in the world with ever-growing prospects for lasting peace. progressive party platform, preamble three years after the end of the second world war, the drums are beating for a third. civil liberties are being destroyed. millions cry out for relief from unbearably high prices. the american way of life is in danger. ' the root cause of this crisis is big business control of our economy and government. with toil and enterprise the american people have created from their rich resources the ‘world’s ‘ greatest productive machine. this machine no longer belongs to the people. its ownership is concentrated in the hands of a few and its prod- “uct used for their enrichment. never before have so few owned so much at the expense of so many. . ten years ago franklin delano roosevelt warned: “the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state. that, in its essence, is fascism.” today that private power has constituted itself an invisible government which pulls the strings of its puppet republican and democratic parties. two sets of candidates compete for votes under the outworn emblems of the old parties. but both represent a single program—a program of monopoly profits through war preparations, lower living standards, and suppression of dissent. for generations the common man of america has resisted this concentration of economic and political power in the hands of a few. the great- est of america’s political leaders have led the people into battle against the money power, the railroads, the trusts, the economic royalists. we of the progressive party are the present- day descendants of these people’s movements and fighting leaders. we are the political heirs of jefferson, jackson and lincoln — of frederick douglass, altgeld and debs—of “fighting bob” lafollette, george norris, and franklin roose- velt. throughout our history new parties have arisen when the old parties have betrayed the people. as jefferson headed a new party to defeat the reactionaries of his day, and as lincoln led a new party to victory over the slave-owners, so today the people, inspired and led by henry wallace, have created a new party to secure peace, free- ‘dom, and abundance. with the firm conviction that the principles of the declaration of independence and of the con- stitution of the united states set forth all funda-","['national', 'party', 'platforms', 'tion', 'great', 'american',

delivered by the liquor power. American govern-
ment is. party government. There are constitu-
tional reasons why this is so. To overcome the
liquor ,power it is necessary to employ the agency
of a political party unitedly committed to Prohi-
bition.

We summon the voters of America to help elect
the Prohibition party to power. We will then
marshal the resources of the government, legis-
lative. executive and judicial, to overcome the
liquor power.

Republican Party Platform of 1948

I
DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES

To establish and maintain peace, to build a
country in which every citizen can earn a good
living with the promise of real progress for him-
self and his family, and to uphold as a beacon
light for mankind everwwhere, the inspiring
American tradition of liberty, opportunity and
justice for all—that is the Republican platform.

To this end we propose as a guide to definite
action the following principles:

Maximum voluntary cooperation between citi-
zens and minimum dependence on law; never,
however, declining courageous recourse to law if
necessary.

Our competitive system furnishes vital oppor-
tunity for youth and for all enterprising citizens;
it makes possible the productive power which is
the unique weapon of our national defense; and
is the mainspring of material well-being and
political freedom.

Government, as the servant of such a system,
should take all needed steps to strengthen and
develop public health, to promote scientific re-
search, to provide security for the aged, and to
promote a stable economy so that men and women
nee) not fear the loss of their jobs or the threat
of economic hardships through no fault of their

own.

The rights and obligations of workers are com-
mensurate with the rights and obligations of em-
plovers and they are interdependent, these rights
should be protected against coercion and exploita-
tion from whatever quarter and with due regard
for the general welfare of all.

| id

' The soil as'our basic natural resource must be
conserved with increased effectiveness; and farm
prices should be supported on a just basis.

Development of the priceless national heritage
which is in our West is vital to our nation.

Administration of government must be eco-
nomical and cHective.

Faulty governmental policies share an impor-
tant responsibility for the present cruelly high
cost of living. We pledge prompt action to correct
these policies. There must be decent living at
decent wages. -

Our common defense must be strengthened and
unified.

Our foreign policy is dedicated to preserving
a free America in a free world of free men. This
calls for strengthening the United Nations and
primary recognition of America’s self-interest in
the liberty of other peoples. Prudently conserving
our own resources, we shall cooperate on a self-
help basis with other peace-loving nations.

Constant and effective insistence on the per-
sonal dignity of the individual, and his right to
complete justice without regard to race, creed or
color, is a fundamental American principle.

We aim always to unite and to strengthen;
never to weaken or divide. In such a brotherhood
will we Americans get results. Thus we will over-
come all obstacles.

I

In the past eighteen months, the Republican
Congress, in the face of frequent obstruction from
the Executive Branch, made a record of solid
achievement. Here are some of the accomplish-
ments of this Republican Congress:

The long trend of extravagant and ill-arivised
Executive action reversed;

the budget balanced:

taxes reduced;

limitation of Presidential tenure to two terms
passed;

assistance to veterans, their widows and orphans
provided;

assistance to agriculture and business enacted;

elimination of the poll tax as a requisite to
soldier voting;

a sensible reform of the labor law, protecting
all rights of Labor while safeguarding the entire
community against those breakdowns in essential


industries which endanger the health and liveli-
hood of all,

a long-range farm program enacted;

unification of the armed services launched;

a military manpower law enacted;

the United Nations fostered;

a haven for displaced persons provided;

the most far-reaching measures in history
adopted to aid the recovery of the free world on
a basis of self-help and with prudent regard for
our own resources;

and, finally, the development of intelligent plans
and party teamwork for the day when the Ameri-
can people entrust the Executive as well as the
Legislative branch of our National Government
to the Republican Party.

We shall waste few words on the tragic lack of
foresight and general inadequacy of those now in
charge of the Executive Branch of the National
Government; they have lost the confidence of citi-
zens of all parties.

Il

Present cruelly high prices are due in large
part to the fact that the government.has not
effectively used the powers it possesses to combat
inflation, but has deliberately encouraged higher
prices.

We pledge an attack upon the basic causes of
inflation, including the following measures:

progressive reduction of the cost of government
through elimination of waste;

stimulation of production as the surest way to
lower prices:

fiscal policies to provide increased incentives -

for production and thrift;

a sound currency;

reduction of the public debt.

We pledge further, that in the management of
our National Government, we shall achieve the
abolition of overlapping, duplication, extrava-
gance. and excessive centralization;

the more efficient assignment of functions within
the government:

and the rooting out of Communism wherever
found.

These things are fundamental.

IV
We must, however, do more.

CAMPAIGN OF 1948 451

The Constitution gives us the affirmative man-
date “to establish justice.”

In Lincoln's words: The dogmas of the quiet
past are inadequate to the stormy present. The
occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must
rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so
we must think anew and act anew.

The tragic experience of Europe tells .us that
popular government disappears when it is ineffec-
tive and no longer can translate into action the
aims and the aspirations of the people.

Therefore, in domestic affairs, we propose:

The maintenance of armed services for air. land
and sea, to a degree which will insure our national
security; and the achievement of effective unity in
the Department of National Defense so as to
insure maximum economy in money and man-
power, and maximum effectiveness in case of war.
We favor sustained effective action to procure
suficient manpower for the services, recognizing
the American principle that every citizen has an
obligation of service to his country.

An adequate privately operated merchant
marine, the continued development of our harbors
and waterways, and the expansion of privately
operated air transportation and communication
systems,

The maintenance of Federal finances in a
healthy condition and continuation of the efforts
so well started by the Republican Congress to re-
duce the enormous burden of taxation in order to
provide incentives for the creation of new indus-
tries and new jobs, and to bring relief from
inflation. We favor intelligent integration of
Federal-State faxing and spending policies de-
signed to eliminate wasteful duplication, and in
order that the State and loca! governments may
be able to assume their separate responsibilities,
the Federal government shall as soon as practica-
ble withdraw or reduce those taxes which can be
best administered by local governments, with par-
ticular consideration of excise and inheritance
taxes; and we favor restoring to America a work-
ing federalism.

Small business, the bulwark of American enter-
prise, must be encouraged through aggressive anti-
monopoly action, elimination of unnecessary con-
trols, protection against discrimination, correction
of tax abuses, and limitation of competition by
governmental organizations.

452 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS
Collective bx- .ining is an obligation as well as
a right. apply:: . equally to workers and em-

plovers: and the fundamental right to strike is
subordinate only to paramount considerations of
public health and safety. Government's chief
function in this field is to promote good will, en-
courage cooperation, and where resort is had to
intervention. to be impartial, preventing violence
and requiring obedience to all law by all parties
invelved. We pledge continuing study to improve
labor-management legislation in the light of ex-
perience and changing conditions.

There must be a long-term program in the in-
terest of agriculture and the consumer which
should include: An accelerated program of
sounder soil conservation; effective protection of
reasonable market prices through flexible support
prices, commodity loans, marketing agreements,
together with such other means as may be neces-
sary, and the development of sound farm credit;
encouragement of family-size farms; intensified
research to discover new crops, new uses for ex-
isting crops, and control of hoof and mouth and
other animal diseases and crop pests: support of
the principle of bona fide farmer-owned and
farmer-operated cooperatives, and sound rural
electrification.

We favor progressive development of the
Nation's water resources for navigation, food con-
trol and power, with immediate action in critical
areas.

We favor conservation of all our natural re-
sources and believe that conservation and stock-
piling of strategic and critical raw materials is
indespensable to the security of the United States.

We urge the full development of our forests on
the basis of cropping and sustained yield with
cooperation of States and private owners for con-
servation and fire protection.

We favor a comprehensive reclamation program
for arid and semi-arid areas with full protection of
the rights and interests of the States in the use
and control of water for irrigation, power develop-
ment incidental thereto and other beneficial uses;
withdrawal or acquisition of lands for public pur-
poses only by Act of Congress and after due con-
sideration of local problems; development of proc-
esses for the extraction of oil and other substances
from oil shale and coal; adequate representation
of the West in the National Administration.

Recognizing the Nation's solemn obligation :o

all veterans, we propose a realistic and adequate
adjustment of benefits on a cost-of-living basis for
service-connected disabled veterans and their de.
pendents, and for the widows, orphans and de-
pendents of veterans who died in the service of
their country. All disabled veterans should have
ample opportunity for suitable, self-sustaining
employment. We demand good-faith compliance
with veterans preference in Federal service with
simplification and codification of the hundreds of
piecemeal Federal laws affecting veterans, and
efficient and businesslike management of the Vet-
erans Administration. We pledge the highest
possible standards of medical care and hospitaliza-
tion.

Housing can best be supplied and financed by
private enterprise; but government can and should
encourage the building of better homes at less
cost. We recommend Federal aid to the States
for local slum clearance and low-rental housing
programs only where there is a need that cannot
be met either by private enterprise or by the
States and localities.

Consistent with the vigorous existence of our
competitive economy, we urge: extension of the
Federal Old Age and Survivors’ Insurance pro-
gram and increase of the benefits to a more
realistic level; strengthening of Federal-State
programs designed to provide more adequate
hospital facilities, too improve methods of treat-
ment for the mentally ill, to advance maternal
and child health and generally to foster a healthy
America.

Lynching or any other form of mob violence
anywhere is a disgrace to any civilized state, and
we favor the prompt enactment of legislation to
end this infamy.

One of the basic principles of this Republic is
the equality of all individuals in their right to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This princi-
ple is enunciated in the Declaration of Independ-
ence and embodied in the Constitution of the
United States; it was vindicated on the field of
battle and became the cornerstone of this Re-
public. This right of equal opportunity to work
and to advance in life should never be limited in
any individual because of race, religion, color, or
country of origin. We favor the enactment and
just enforcement of such Federal legislation as
may be necessary to maintain this right at all
times in every part of this Republic.


We favor the abolition of the poll tax as a
requisite to voting.

We are opposed to the idea of racial segregation
in the armed services of the United States.

Vv

We pledge a vigorous enforcement of existing
laws against Communists and enactment of such
new legislation as may be necessary to expose the
treasonable activities of Communists and defeat
their objective of establishing here a godless dic-
tatorship controlled from abroad.

We favor a revision of the procedure for the
election of the President and Vice President which
will more exactly reflect the popular vote.

We recommend to Congress the submission of
a constitutional amendment providing equal rights
for women.

We favor equal pay for equal work regardless
of sex.

We propose a well-paid and efficient Federal
career service.

We favor the elimination of unnecessary Fed-
eral bureaus and of the duplication of the func-
tions of necessary governmental agencies.

We favor equality of educational opportunity
for all and the promotion of education and edu-
cational facilities.

We favor restoration to the States of their his-
toric rights to the tide and submerged lands, tribu-
tary waters, lakes, and streams.

We favor eventual statehood for Hawaii, Alaska
and Puerto Rico. We urge development of Alas-
kan land communications and natural resources.

We favor self-government for the residents of
the nation’s capital.

VI

We dedicate our foreign policy to the preserva-
tion of a free America in a free world of free men.
With neither malice nor desire for conquest, we
shall strive for a just peace with all nations.

America is deeply interested in the stability,
security and liberty of other independent peoples.
Within the prudent limits of our own economic
welfare, we shall cooperate, on a basis of self-help
and mutual aid, to assist other peace-loving
nations to restore their economic independence
and the human rights and fundamental freedoms
for which we fought two wars and upon which
dependable peace must build. We shall insist on

CAMPAIGN OF 1948 453

businesslike and efficient administration of all
foreign aid.

We welcome and encourage the sturdy progress
toward unity in Western Europe.

We shall erect our foreign policy on the basis
of friendly firmness which comes cooperation
but spurns appeasement. We shall pursue a con-
sistent foreign policy which invites steadiness and
reliance and which thus avoids the misunderstand-
ings from which wars result. We shall protect
the future against the errors of the Democrat
Administration, which has too often lacked clarity,
competence or consistency in our vital inter-
national relationships and has too often abandoned
justice.

We believe in collective security against ag-
gression and in behalf of justice and freedom. We
shall support the United Nations as the world’s
best hope in this direction, striving to strengthen
it and promote its effective evolution and use. The
United Nations should progressively establish
international law, be freed of any veto in the
peaceful settlement of international disputes, and
be provided with the armed forces contemplated
by the Charter. We particularly commend the
value of regional arrangements as prescribed by
the Charter; and we cite the Western Hemispheric
Defense Pact as a useful model.

We shall nourish these Pan-American agree.
ments in the new spirit of cooperation which
implements the Monroe Doctrine.

We welcome Israel into the family of nations
and take pride in the fact that the Republican
Party was the first to call for the establishment of
a free and independent Jewish Commonwealth.
The vacillation of the Democrat Administration on
this question has undermined the prestige of the
United Nations. Subject to the letter and spirit of
the United Nations Charter, we pledge to Israel
full recognition, with its boundaries as sanctioned
by the United Nations and aid in developing its
economy.

We will foster and cherish our historic policy
of friendship with China and assert our deep
interest in the maintenance of its integrity and
freedom.

We shall seek to restore autonomy and self-
sufficiency as rapidly as possible in our post-war
occupied areas, guarding always against any re-
birth of aggression.

We shall relentlessly pursue our aims for the


454 NATIONAL PARTY PLATFORMS

universal limitation and control of arms and imple-
ments of war on a basis of reliable disciplines
against bad faith.

At all times safeguarding our own industry and
agriculture, and under efficient administrative pro-
cedures for the legitimate consideration of do-
mestic needs, we shall support the system of
reciprocal trade and encourage international com-
merce.

We pledge that under a Republican Administra-
tion all foreign commitments shall be made public
and subject to constitutional ratification. We shall
say what we mean and mean what we say. In
all of these things we shall primarily consult the
national security and welfare of our own United
States. In all of these things we shall welcome
the world’s cooperation. But in none of these
things shall we surrender our ideals or our free
institutions.

We are proud of the part that Republicans have
taken in those limited areas of foreign policy in
which they have been permitted to participate.
We shall invite the Minority Party to join us under
the next Republican Administration in stopping
partisan politics at the water's edge.

We faithfully dedicate ourselves to peace with
justice.

vu

Guided by these principles, with continuing
faith in Almighty God; united in the spirit of
brotherhood; and using to the full the skills, re-
sources and blessings of liberty with which we are
endowed; we, the American people, will coura-
geously advance to meet the challenge of the
future.

Socialist Party Platform—-1948
PREAMBLE

Mankind is haunted by new fears. In the
crowded metropolis and on the distant farm, men
ask themselves whether, under freedom, depres-
sion can be avoided, poverty vanquished and war
uprooted.

Starvation stalks much of the world, and in our
own land men dread the insecurity that tomorrow
may bring. While millions go in rags, the world’s
looms are again knitting the uniforms that will
shroud new victims to be offered on the altars of
nationalism, imperialism and tyranny.

In 1948, we face the elemental question of

survival. The atomic revolution has burst upon
the world and a new unity has been forged among
the human race: men who have refused to be
brothers one of another may now become children
of a common doom.

. . . Unless we learn to reorganize our society
for survival and not for mutual extinction;

.. . Unless we learn new techniques of co-
operation to replace the old policies of competi-
tion;

.. . Unless we move rapidly toward socializa-
tion by which alone the individual can be pre-
served in the inter-dependent world of the turbine,
the plane, the steel mill and the uranium pile:

. . . Unless we move rapidly to a world order
without greed, profit and hate.

The American people, because of the accidents
of geography, will make the decision for mankind.
Our mines and factories were not devastated by
the physical havoc of the last war. For America,
and consequently the world, it is not too late.

Three forces today are competing for the
loyalty of men. And in this race, the stakes are
the survival of mankind.

On the one hand, an economic system calling
itself “free enterprise” asserts that it can lead to
the salvation of humanity. It has brought us re-
peatedly to depressions and wars, yet its spokes-
men in the Democratic and Republican Parties
still pretend they have solutions.

They have, in fact, betrayed the promises with
which they woo the American people every four
years. They offered prosperity and delivered de-
pression. They pledged peace and delivered war.
They promised to increase our standard of living
and are now raising the cost of living. They
promised freedom to organized labor and hobbled
it with new bonds.

They have sought partisan advantage and
jeopardized national welfare. The dominant wings
in their parties have combined to destroy price
control and give us inflation, to undermine re-
straints on greed and give us shortage, to favor
the rich and deny the poor, to cut the taxes of
the wealthy and insult the common man with a
crumb.

There is a second force in the world—which
promises security and speaks of freedom but de-
livers only economic bondage and dictatorship. It
is the force of totalitarianism. Yesterday its most
sinister front was Fascism; today it is Communism.

In the United States, it marches under masked",21335,3405,"- meow national party platforms delivered by the liquor power. american govern- ment is. party government. there are constitu- tional reasons why this is so. to overcome the liquor ,power it is necessary to employ the agency of a political party unitedly committed to prohi- bition. we summon the voters of america to help elect the

currency; reduction of the public debt. we pledge further, that in the management of our national government, we shall achieve the abolition of overlapping, duplication, extrava- gance. and excessive centralization; the more efficient assignment of functions within the government: and the rooting out of communism wherever found. these things are fundamental. iv we must, however, do more. campaign of the constitution gives us the affirmative man- date “to establish justice.” in lincoln's words: the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. the occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion. as our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. the tragic experience of europe tells .us that popular government disappears when it is ineffec- tive and no longer can translate into action the aims and the aspirations of the people. therefore, in domestic affairs, we propose: the maintenance of armed services for air. land and sea, to a degree which will insure our national security; and the achievement of effective unity in the department of national defense so as to insure maximum economy in money and man- power, and maximum effectiveness in case of war. we favor sustained effective action to procure suficient manpower for the services, recognizing the american principle that every citizen has an obligation of service to his country. an adequate privately operated merchant marine, the continued development of our harbors and waterways, and the expansion of privately operated air transportation and communication systems, the maintenance of federal finances in a healthy condition and continuation of the efforts so well started by the republican congress to re- duce the enormous burden of taxation in order to provide incentives for the creation of new indus- tries and new jobs, and to bring relief from inflation. we favor intelligent integration of federal-state faxing and spending policies de- signed to eliminate wasteful duplication, and in order that the state and loca! governments may be able to assume their separate responsibilities, the federal government shall as soon as practica- ble withdraw or reduce those taxes which can be best administered by local governments, with par- ticular consideration of excise and inheritance taxes; and we favor restoring to america a work- ing federalism. small business, the bulwark of american enter- prise, must be encouraged through aggressive anti- monopoly action, elimination of unnecessary con- trols, protection against discrimination, correction of tax abuses, and limitation of competition by governmental organizations. dew ewe national party platforms collective bx- .ining is an obligation as well as a right. apply:: . equally to workers and em- plovers: and the fundamental right to strike is subordinate only to paramount considerations of public health and safety. government's chief function in this field is to promote good will, en- courage cooperation, and where resort is had to intervention. to be impartial, preventing violence and requiring obedience to all law by all parties invelved. we pledge continuing study to improve labor-management legislation in the light of ex- perience and changing conditions. there must be a long-term program in the in- terest of agriculture and the consumer which should include: an accelerated program of sounder soil conservation; effective protection of reasonable market prices through flexible support prices, commodity loans, marketing agreements, together with such other means as may be neces- sary, and the development of sound farm credit; encouragement of family-size farms; intensified research to discover new crops, new uses for ex- isting crops, and control of hoof and mouth and other animal diseases and crop pests: support of the principle of bona fide farmer-owned and farmer-operated cooperatives, and sound rural electrification. we favor progressive development of the nation's water resources for navigation, food con- trol and power, with immediate action in critical areas. we favor conservation of all our natural re- sources and believe that conservation and stock- piling of strategic and critical raw materials is indespensable to the security of the united states. we urge the full development of our forests on the basis of cropping and sustained yield with cooperation of states and private owners for con- servation and fire protection. we favor a comprehensive reclamation program for arid and semi-arid areas with full protection of the rights and interests of the states in the use and control of water for irrigation, power develop- ment incidental thereto and other beneficial uses; withdrawal or acquisition of lands for public pur- poses only by act of congress and after due con- sideration of local problems; development of proc- esses for the extraction of oil and other substances from oil shale and coal; adequate representation of the west in the national administration. recognizing the nation's solemn obligation :o all veterans, we propose a realistic and adequate adjustment of benefits on a cost-of-living basis for service-connected disabled veterans and their de. pendents, and for the widows, orphans and de- pendents of veterans who died in the service of their country. all disabled veterans should have ample opportunity for suitable, self-sustaining employment. we demand good-faith compliance with veterans preference in federal service with simplification and codification of the hundreds of piecemeal federal laws affecting veterans, and efficient and businesslike management of the vet- erans administration. we pledge the highest possible standards of medical care and hospitaliza- tion. housing can best be supplied and financed by private enterprise; but government can and should encourage the building of better homes at less cost. we recommend federal aid to the states for local slum clearance and low-rental housing programs only where there is a need that cannot be met either by private enterprise or by the states and localities. consistent with the vigorous existence of our competitive economy, we urge: extension of the federal old age and survivors’ insurance pro- gram and increase of the benefits to a more realistic level; strengthening of federal-state programs designed to provide more adequate hospital facilities, too improve methods of treat- ment for the mentally ill, to advance maternal and child health and generally to foster a healthy america. lynching or any other form of mob violence anywhere is a disgrace to any civilized state, and we favor the prompt enactment of legislation to end this infamy. one of the basic principles of this republic is the equality of all individuals in their right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. this princi- ple is enunciated in the declaration of independ- ence and embodied in the constitution of the united states; it was vindicated on the field of battle and became the cornerstone of this re- public. this right of equal opportunity to work and to advance in life should never be limited in any individual because of race, religion, color, or country of origin. we favor the enactment and just enforcement of such federal legislation as may be necessary to maintain this right at all times in every part of this republic. we favor the abolition of the poll tax as a requisite to voting. we are opposed to the idea of racial segregation in the armed services of the united states. vv we pledge a vigorous enforcement of existing laws against communists and enactment of such new legislation as may be necessary to expose the treasonable activities of communists and defeat their objective of establishing here a godless dic- tatorship controlled from abroad. we favor a revision of the procedure for the election of the president and vice president which will more exactly reflect the popular vote. we recommend to congress the submission of a constitutional amendment providing equal rights for women. we favor equal pay for equal work regardless of sex. we propose a well-paid and efficient federal career service. we favor the elimination of unnecessary fed- eral bureaus and of the duplication of the func- tions of necessary governmental agencies. we favor equality of educational opportunity for all and the promotion of education and edu- cational facilities. we favor restoration to the states of their his- toric rights to the tide and submerged lands, tribu- tary waters, lakes, and streams. we favor eventual statehood for hawaii, alaska and puerto rico. we urge development of alas- kan land communications and natural resources. we favor self-government for the residents of the nation’s capital. vi we dedicate our foreign policy to the preserva- tion of a free america in a free world of free men. with neither malice nor desire for conquest, we shall strive for a just peace with all nations. america is deeply interested in the stability, security and liberty of other independent peoples. within the prudent limits of our own economic welfare, we shall cooperate, on a basis of self-help and mutual aid, to assist other peace-loving nations to restore their economic independence and the human rights and fundamental freedoms for which we fought two wars and upon which dependable peace must build. we shall insist on campaign of businesslike and efficient administration of all foreign aid. we welcome and encourage the sturdy progress toward unity in western europe. we shall erect our foreign policy on the basis of friendly firmness which comes cooperation but spurns appeasement. we shall pursue a con- sistent foreign policy which invites steadiness and reliance and which thus avoids the misunderstand- ings from which wars result. we shall protect the future against the errors of the democrat administration, which has too often lacked clarity, competence or consistency in our vital inter- national relationships and has too often abandoned justice. we believe in collective security against ag- gression and in behalf of justice and freedom. we shall support the united nations as the world’s best hope in this direction, striving to strengthen it and promote its effective evolution and use. the united nations should progressively establish international law, be freed of any veto in the peaceful settlement of international disputes, and be provided with the armed forces contemplated by the charter. we particularly commend the value of regional arrangements as prescribed by the charter; and we cite the western hemispheric defense pact as a useful model. we shall nourish these pan-american agree. ments in the new spirit of cooperation which implements the monroe doctrine. we welcome israel into the family of nations and take pride in the fact that the republican party was the first to call for the establishment of a free and independent jewish commonwealth. the vacillation of the democrat administration on this question has undermined the prestige of the united nations. subject to the letter and spirit of the united nations charter, we pledge to israel full recognition, with its boundaries as sanctioned by the united nations and aid in developing its economy. we will foster and cherish our historic policy of friendship with china and assert our deep interest in the maintenance of its integrity and freedom. we shall seek to restore autonomy and self- sufficiency as rapidly as possible in our post-war occupied areas, guarding always against any re- birth of aggression. we shall relentlessly pursue our aims for the national party platforms universal limitation and control of arms and imple- ments of war on a basis of reliable disciplines against bad faith. at all times safeguarding our own industry and agriculture, and under efficient administrative pro- cedures for the legitimate consideration of do- mestic needs, we shall support the system of reciprocal trade and encourage international com- merce. we pledge that under a republican administra- tion all foreign commitments shall be made public and subject to constitutional ratification. we shall say what we mean and mean what we say. in all of these things we shall primarily consult the national security and welfare of our own united states. in all of these things we shall welcome the world’s cooperation. but in none of these things shall we surrender our ideals or our free institutions. we are proud of the part that republicans have taken in those limited areas of foreign policy in which they have been permitted to participate. we shall invite the minority party to join us under the next republican administration in stopping partisan politics at the water's edge. we faithfully dedicate ourselves to peace with justice. vu guided by these principles, with continuing faith in almighty god; united in the spirit of brotherhood; and using to the full the skills, re- sources and blessings of liberty with which we are endowed; we, the american people, will coura- geously advance to meet the challenge of the future. socialist party platform—- preamble mankind is haunted by new fears. in the crowded metropolis and on the distant farm, men ask themselves whether, under freedom, depres- sion can be avoided, poverty vanquished and war uprooted. starvation stalks much of the world, and in our own land men dread the insecurity that tomorrow may bring. while millions go in rags, the world’s looms are again knitting the uniforms that will shroud new victims to be offered on the altars of nationalism, imperialism and tyranny. in , we face the elemental question of survival. the atomic revolution has burst upon the world and a new unity has been forged among the human race: men who have refused to be brothers one of another may now become children of a common doom. . . . unless we learn to reorganize our society for survival and not for mutual extinction; .. . unless we learn new techniques of co- operation to replace the old policies of competi- tion; .. . unless we move rapidly toward socializa- tion by which alone the individual can be pre- served in the inter-dependent world of the turbine, the plane, the steel mill and the uranium pile: . . . unless we move rapidly to a world order without greed, profit and hate. the american people, because of the accidents of geography, will make the decision for mankind. our mines and factories were not devastated by the physical havoc of the last war. for america, and consequently the world, it is not too late. three forces today are competing for the loyalty of men. and in this race, the stakes are the survival of mankind. on the one hand, an economic system calling itself “free enterprise” asserts that it can lead to the salvation of humanity. it has brought us re- peatedly to depressions and wars, yet its spokes- men in the democratic and republican parties still pretend they have solutions. they have, in fact, betrayed the promises with which they woo the american people every four years. they offered prosperity and delivered de- pression. they pledged peace and delivered war. they promised to increase our standard of living and are now raising the cost of living. they promised freedom to organized labor and hobbled it with new bonds. they have sought partisan advantage and jeopardized national welfare. the dominant wings in their parties have combined to destroy price control and give us inflation, to undermine re- straints on greed and give us shortage, to favor the rich and deny the poor, to cut the taxes of the wealthy and insult the common man with a crumb. there is a second force in the world—which promises security and speaks of freedom but de- livers only economic bondage and dictatorship. it is the force of totalitarianism. yesterday its most sinister front was fascism; today it is communism. in the united states, it marches under masked","['meow', 'national', 'party', 'platforms', 'delivered', 'liquor', 'power', 'american', 'ment', 'party', 'government', 'tional', 'reasons', 'overcome',
