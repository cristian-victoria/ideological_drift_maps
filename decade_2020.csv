We honor the communities native to this continent, and recognize that our country was built on Indigenous homelands. We pay our respects to the millions of Indigenous people throughout history who have protected our lands, waters, and animals. We respectfully acknowledge that we present this Platform at our 2020 Democratic National Convention on the lands of the Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians, the Forest County Potawatomi Community, the Ho-Chunk Nation, the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, the Menominee Nation, the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin, the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, the St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin, the Sokaogon Chippewa Community, and the Stockbridge-Munsee Community, Band of Mohican Indians. PREAMBLE America is an idea—one that has endured and evolved through war and depression, prevailed over fascism and communism, and radiated hope to far distant corners of the earth. Americans believe that diversity is our greatest strength. That protest is among the highest forms of patriotism. That our fates and fortunes are bound to rise and fall together. That even when we fall short of our highest ideals, we never stop trying to build a more perfect union. When the American people go to the polls this fall, we will be choosing more than a candidate. Character is on the ballot in this election. The character of our President, yes, but more than that: the character of our democracy, our society, and our leadership in the world. The challenges before us—the worst public health crisis in a century, the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, the worst period of global upheaval in a generation, the urgent global crisis posed by climate change, the intolerable racial injustice that still stains the fabric of our nation—will test America’s character like never before. The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare deep-seated problems in our society— the fragility of our economy and social safety net, the risks posed by growing inequality, the impacts of racial and economic disparities on health and well-being, and the profound consequences of deepening polarization and political paralysis. The bill has come due on the Trump Administration’s hollowing out of our public institutions: the sidelining of experts, the rejection of science, the underinvestment in research, and the gross corruption and abuses of power. President Trump’s dereliction of duty has caused the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans, the loss of tens of millions of American jobs, and lasting harm to our children’s education and future. And it has revealed, at tragic economic and human cost, the emptiness of the Republican Party’s “America First” foreign policy. Under President Trump, America stands alone. Friends and foes alike neither admire nor fear President Trump’s leadership—they dismiss and ridicule it. The Republican Party under President Trump has made America small— when we are a people called to do the greatest things. Democrats will fight to repair the soul of this nation. To unite and to heal our country. To turn this crisis into a crucible, from which we will forge a stronger, brighter, and more equitable future. We must right the wrongs in our democracy, redress the systemic injustices that have long plagued our society, throw open the doors of opportunity for all Americans, and reinvent our institutions at home and our leadership abroad. We do not simply aspire to return our country to where we were four years ago. We know we must be bolder and more ambitious. We must once again stop another Republican recession from becoming a second Great Depression. President Trump and the Republican Party have rigged the economy in favor of the wealthiest few and the biggest corporations, and left working families and small businesses out in the cold. Democrats will forge a new social and economic contract with the American people—a contract that creates millions of new jobs and promotes shared prosperity, closes racial gaps in income and wealth, guarantees the right to join or form a union, raises wages and ensures equal pay for women and paid family leave for all, and safeguards a secure and dignified retirement. We must guarantee health care not as a privilege for some, but as a right for every single American. For a century, Democrats have fought to secure universal health care. In the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, President Trump and the Republican Party are trying to tear health care away from millions of people who depend on it for survival. Democrats will not allow that to happen. We will not rest until every American can access quality health care and affordable prescription drugs. We must steel and strengthen our democracy, not distort and debase it. Democrats believe there is nothing to fear from the voices and votes of the American people. We will restore the full power of the Voting Rights Act and stamp out voter suppression in all its forms. We will curb the corrupting influence of money in politics and protect the integrity of our elections from all enemies, foreign and domestic. We will never accept political gridlock as our fate. We will never tire in our fight to deliver results and create opportunity for all Americans. And we will end the war on government that has politicized our institutions, denigrated public service, and left the American people on their own instead of working to make them whole. We must heal our nation’s deepest wounds, not fan the flames of hate. Democrats will root out structural and systemic racism in our economy and our society, and reform our criminal justice system from top to bottom, because we believe Black lives matter. We will ensure that our nation continues to prize diversity and compassion, and welcomes those who yearn to participate in our great democratic experiment by creating a humane, 21st century immigration system that benefits all Americans. We will give hate no safe harbor. We will never amplify or legitimize the voices of racism, misogyny, anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim bigotry, or white supremacy. Democrats will protect and promote the equal rights of all our citizens—women, LGBTQ+ people, religious minorities, people with disabilities, Native Americans, and all who have been discriminated against in too many ways and for too many generations. We commit ourselves to the vision articulated by Frederick Douglass of “a Government founded upon justice, and recognizing the equal rights of all.” We must lead the world in taking on the climate crisis, not deny the science and accelerate the damage. From Houston, Texas, to Mexico Beach, Florida; from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Davenport, Iowa, the last four years have seen record-breaking storms, devastating wildfires, and historic floods. Democrats will rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement and go further, building a thriving, equitable, and globally competitive clean energy economy that puts workers and communities first, and leaves no one behind. We must provide a world-class education in every ZIP code, to every child, because education is a critical public good. Democrats believe in universal early childhood education, and affordable, high-quality child care. We will shut down the school-to-prison pipeline, and build a school-to-opportunity pipeline in its place. We will make college affordable again, and give Americans relief from crushing student debt. We commit to a foreign policy that accelerates our domestic renewal, not undermines it. We will focus on what matters most to Americans—more and better jobs, greater security , a cleaner environment, and a more inclusive and resilient society. Democrats will lead with diplomacy as our tool of first resort and mobilize our allies and partners to meet the tests none of us can meet on our own. We will stand up to the forces of authoritarianism, not aid and abet their rise, and we will speak and act with clarity and purpose on behalf of human rights wherever they are under threat. And we will honor our sacred covenant with our women and men in uniform, our veterans, and our military families who have carried the burdens of wars that must—at long last—come to an end. Above all, Democrats still believe in the American idea—its principles, its purpose, and its promise. We know that four more years of the crass, craven, corrupt leadership we have seen from Donald Trump and the Republican Party will damage our character and our country beyond repair. We pray, as Langston Hughes did, “O, let America be America again—the land that never has been yet—and yet must be—the land where every man is free.” Democrats call on all Americans to come together and seize this last, best chance to restore the soul of our nation —and vote this November to ensure our greatest days are still to come. PROTECTING AMERICANS AND RECOVERING FROM THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC When we do not have competent, experienced, compassionate leaders in government, the American people suffer. That is the case with the novel coronavirus. President Trump and his Administration missed multiple opportunities to protect the American people from this deadly pathogen. Instead of recognizing the danger and confronting it head-on, President Trump lied to the American people about the disease’s severity, its transmissibility, and the threat it posed to lives and livelihoods. Make no mistake: President Trump’s abject failure to respond forcefully and capably to the COVID-19 pandemic—his failure to lead—makes him responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans. COVID-19 has laid bare deep fault lines in our economy, our society, and our health care system. Disparities in health care access, in access to paid sick leave, in environmental quality, in the employment market, and in housing have contributed to disproportionate rates of infection and death among Black Americans, Native Americans, Latinos, and certain Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. President Trump’s failure to pay attention to early intelligence reports about the pandemic wasted critical weeks in which we could have prepared for the outbreak. Once the pandemic began spreading in the United States, the President’s failure to lay out clear, consistent guidelines for cities, states, businesses, and school districts to control the spread of COVID-19 created widespread confusion and chaos. His reckless disregard for the advice of public health experts has made it harder for mayors and governors to protect the American people. Rather than surge the production of personal protective equipment and other critical supplies where they were needed most, the Administration held life-saving resources hostage for political obeisance. Instead of bringing Americans together, President Trump tried to divide us, using racist and xenophobic rhetoric that has contributed to an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. And in the midst of the pandemic, the Trump Administration is arguing in court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act and rip health coverage away from tens of millions of people. President Trump and his Administration have also failed to drive an economic response that is commensurate with the scale of the challenge before us, preferring to act as though the recession caused by his incompetent mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic will correct itself. He has hung small businesses out to dry while cutting blank checks to the largest corporations; failed to enact adequate support for public school systems, colleges, universities, and state and local governments to maintain public services and jobs; endangered the health of essential workers by failing to enact workplace safety standards; and neglected to protect working families from economic ruin. Democrats will save lives by using every available tool to beat back this pandemic, which continues to sicken and kill hundreds of Americans per day, and lead a global effort to prevent, detect, and respond to future pandemic threats. We must start by making COVID-19 testing widely available, convenient, and free to everyone. We must also expand funding so state and local public health departments can hire sufficient staff to conduct contact tracing for everyone who tests positive for the novel coronavirus. Only through widespread, regular testing and tracing can we hope to understand the scope of the pandemic and contain it. In a public health crisis, we all have to rely on each other. That’s why Democrats support making COVID-19 testing, treatment, and any eventual vaccines free to everyone, regardless of their wealth, insurance coverage, or immigration status. We are all only as safe from this disease as are the most vulnerable among us. It has always been a crisis that tens of millions of Americans have no or inadequate health insurance—but in a pandemic, it’s catastrophic for public health. The current crisis would be even worse without the Affordable Care Act in place. But in the COVID-19 pandemic, Americans need even more help, which is why Democrats will take immediate action to preserve and expand health insurance coverage. We will provide direct, increased support to states to enroll eligible adults in Medicaid, have the federal government cover a higher percentage of the bill, and add incentives for states which have not yet expanded Medicaid to do so. For people who risk losing their insurance coverage if they lose their jobs in this pandemic and in President Trump’s recession, Democrats believe the federal government should pick up 100 percent of the tab for COBRA insurance, which keeps people on their employer-sponsored plans, without restrictions. We will re-open the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, even outside of the normal open enrollment season, and expand subsidies to make it easier for people to buy health coverage. Democrats will also make available on the marketplace a public option administered through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) which includes a platinum-level choice, with low fees and no deductibles. Low-income Americans will be automatically enrolled in the public option at zero cost to them, though they may choose to opt out at any time. We will keep these emergency measures in place until the pandemic ends and unemployment falls significantly. And should the United States find itself in another pandemic or severe economic downturn in the future, these protections will be made automatically available, so Americans are never again left to fend for themselves in times of crisis. Democrats are appalled that President Trump failed to act on the advice of Congress to maintain a strong stockpile of critical medical supplies, including personal protective equipment, or adequately surge U.S. manufacturing of needed equipment through tools like the Defense Production Act. The resulting equipment shortages endangered millions of lives, including those of our brave frontline health care workers and other essential workers. Such shortages are unacceptable and must never happen again. Democrats will direct the federal government to work with private-sector manufacturers to dramatically scale up the United States’ domestic manufacturing capacity for both personal protective equipment and essential medicines. We will restore federal leadership to ensure medical supplies are distributed according to need, not political favoritism, and never put states in the position of having to compete against each other for life-saving materials. Democrats will aggressively enforce non-discrimination protections in the Americans with Disabilities Act and other civil rights laws, especially when designing emergency management systems and new facilities and services in response to the pandemic. Democrats will prohibit unjustified segregation of patients with disabilities, and additionally prohibit rationing of health care that refuses or diverts hospitalization, treatment, or supplies based on a patient’s disability. We recognize people with disabilities living in group homes and other care facilities are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19, and that people with disabilities may require additional resources to protect their health, well-being, and independence during the pandemic. We will improve oversight and expand protections for residents and staff at nursing homes, which have seen some of the worst COVID-19 outbreaks. And we will expand support for telemedicine, so Americans do not have to go without essential health care during the pandemic. America must never again be left vulnerable to a global pandemic. Democrats believe we must follow the informed advice of scientists and public health experts, and will take steps to protect federal scientists from political influence. Democrats will act swiftly to stand up a comprehensive, national public health surveillance program for COVID-19 and future infectious diseases. We will recruit at least 100,000 contact tracers with support from trusted local organizations in the communities most at risk to help state and local health departments use culturally competent approaches to identify people at risk of contracting or spreading the coronavirus. Democrats believe we must reverse decades of underinvestment in America’s public health infrastructure. We will substantially increase funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and for state and local public health departments, many of which suffered deep budget cuts during the Great Recession and are at risk of further cuts as a result of President Trump’s recession. State and local public health departments should be given sufficient resources to address pandemic diseases and other public health crises through coordinated efforts that are inclusive of underrepresented groups who may be disproportionately impacted. Democrats will support medical and public health research grants for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), which are particularly well suited to research health disparities in the context of COVID-19. Solving the public health crisis posed by the pandemic is the surest way to get the economy back on track. Countries that have taken aggressive measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic and stop chains of infection from spreading are poised to have stronger, faster recoveries than the United States. But containing the pandemic won’t be enough to repair the damage President Trump has done to our economy and to the American people—or to build back better. During acute economic downturns, Democrats believe that we must take care of our workforce and aim to keep workers whole. We will reform the current unemployment insurance system to enable more workers to remain attached to their jobs, including by promoting payroll support and work-sharing programs with generous rates of wage replacement and requirements that employers maintain workers’ benefits. For those workers who do lose their jobs, we will expand the unemployment insurance system to cover more workers, including independent contractors and gig, part-time, and tipped workers; make sure platform companies and companies that misclassify employees as contractors pay in to support the system like other employers do ; and raise wage replacement rates, which are far too low in many states. We will expand, not cut, nutrition assistance and food security programs that millions of Americans are relying on in this crisis. Democrats will also make long-overdue investments to upgrade and modernize states’ unemployment system technology and ensure the Department of Labor conducts strong oversight of state unemployment systems to make sure that unemployed workers can quickly and efficiently access the benefits they are owed. To prevent President Trump’s recession from becoming a depression, Democrats believe we must act immediately to make ambitious investments that will support and create jobs. We urgently need to support state and local governments, which are suffering severe budget shortfalls due to declines in tax revenues while being asked to shoulder the burden of COVID-related services and rising unemployment. State and local budget cuts translate quickly into lost jobs in education, health care, and social services—all fields where we need to be adding jobs to meet the needs of the American people. Democrats will extend significant aid to state and local governments, school districts , and public and nonprofit colleges and universities, including HBCUs and MSIs, to address these budget shortfalls and secure jobs. We will condition state and federal aid on maintaining and expanding public-sector employment, including provisions to protect workers’ rights. In states and cities across the country, too many parents are being forced to choose between keeping their jobs and keeping their children safe. Democrats believe that making child care affordable and widely available is essential to recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. We will provide funding to stabilize the sector and ensure child care and educational settings are able to meet the highest possible public health and worker safety standards to protect the health of care workers, children, parents, and the broader community. The United States is facing an unprecedented housing crisis as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and President Trump's recession, with millions of families at risk of being evicted. We support state and local measures to freeze rent increases, evictions, utility shutoffs, and late fees for rent, to prevent families from becoming homeless and making the pandemic even worse. The COVID-19 pandemic has hit small businesses especially hard. Democrats support making significant, immediate grants and loans to help small businesses make payroll, pay rent and other expenses, and keep their doors open when possible. Some estimates indicate as many as 40 percent of Black-owned small businesses may not survive President Trump’s recession, and small businesses owned by Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and Latinos are also at risk. Democrats will prioritize support for Black entrepreneurs and other entrepreneurs of color, as well as women entrepreneurs , including by expanding funding for Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and other proven programs that invest in low-income communities and communities of color. We will impose rigorous oversight on big corporations seeking financial assistance to weather the pandemic and President Trump’s recession, to ensure that federal dollars support keeping workers on payroll, not enriching CEOs or shareholders. Taxpayer money should not be used to pay out dividends, fund stock buybacks, or give raises to executives. No one should have to choose between protecting their health and earning a living. Paid sick leave is a necessity even under normal circumstances, but in a pandemic, it’s a matter of national security. This is especially true for the Black, Latino, Asian American and Pacific Islander, Native American, and low-income workers who are less likely to be able to work from home. We will immediately enact robust paid sick leave protections as part of the COVID-19 response for all workers in the economy, including contractors, gig workers, domestic workers, and the self-employed. And Democrats will take immediate action to protect essential workers on the job where the Trump Administration has neglected them, from agriculture to meatpacking plants to manufacturing facilities to hospitals, including by issuing and enforcing effective infectious disease workplace safety standards through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. As millions of Americans have stayed at home to prevent the spread of the pandemic, it is plain to see that in the 21st century, an accessible internet is not optional: it is a vital tool for receiving an education and for participating in the economy, and all Americans need access to high-speed, affordable broadband service. Democrats will take action to prevent states from blocking municipalities and rural co-ops from building publicly-owned broadband networks, and increase federal support for municipal broadband while requiring that funding recipients adhere to policies that support good jobs and include strong protections for workers’ right to organize. We will increase public investment in rural, urban, and Tribal broadband infrastructure, offer low-income Americans subsidies for accessing high-speed internet , and invest in digital literacy training programs, so children and families and people with disabilities can fully participate in school, work, and life from their homes. And Democrats will restore the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) clear authority to take strong enforcement action against broadband providers who violate net neutrality principles through blocking, throttling, paid prioritization, or other measures that create artificial scarcity and raise consumer prices for this vital service. President Trump and his Administration have not only failed the American people, they have failed the world. In past public health crises, including the Ebola epidemic, disciplined American diplomacy shaped and led a common global response, rallied public and private resources, accelerated research into treatments and vaccines, and directed global emergency aid. In the COVID-19 pandemic, President Trump not only failed to lead, he actively sabotaged global efforts to slow the pandemic. He refused to work with our partners to identify and coordinate manufacture of potential vaccines; allegedly tried to poach exclusive rights to a vaccine candidate from our ally Germany; cut CDC and State Department programs for early identification of infectious pathogens; withdrew funding and support for the World Health Organization (WHO); and tried to distract from his dereliction of duty by drawing from the authoritarian playbook he so admires —using racist rhetoric to blame “outsiders” and stoke divisions at home. Democrats will take the opposite tack by restoring American leadership, driving a coordinated global health and economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and ensuring that we’re far better prepared for future global health emergencies. BUILDING A STRONGER, FAIRER ECONOMY The economy is not working for the American people. In a matter of weeks, the abject failure of President Trump and his Administration to competently respond to the COVID-19 pandemic erased all the job gains made since the Obama-Biden Administration pulled the country out of the Great Recession, and plunged the economy into recession once more. President Trump inherited the longest economic expansion in American history from the Obama-Biden Administration, and he squandered it. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, President Trump was presiding over a recession in the manufacturing sector, after years of growth in the Obama-Biden Administration. He had the audacity to pay for a permanent tax cut for big business by raising taxes on working families. He launched a reckless trade war with China that cost more than 300,000 American jobs and sent farmers into bankruptcy, decimating the American heartland. He has left our communities vulnerable and exposed to the impacts of climate change, let other countries outpace us in the clean energy revolution America should be leading , and completely failed to fulfill his campaign promise to the American people to invest in rebuilding and modernizing our nation’s crumbling infrastructure. But our economy was rigged against working families and the middle class even before the novel coronavirus sickened millions and killed more than 150,000 Americans and counting. Working families’ incomes have been largely stagnant for decades, while the cost of basic needs—from housing to health care, higher education to child care—keep rising at precipitous rates. Meanwhile, the rich have been capturing a larger and larger share of the economic pie, with incomes for the top one percent growing five times faster than those of the bottom 90 percent. America bills itself as the land of opportunity, but intergenerational mobility has plummeted; children born in the United States are less likely to move up the income ladder than those in Canada, Denmark, or the United Kingdom. Women still earn just 82 cents to every dollar men earn, with even greater disparities for women of color. Median incomes are lower and poverty rates are higher for Black Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and certain Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, compared to median white households. And there is a persistent, pernicious racial wealth gap that holds millions of Americans back, with the typical white household holding six times more wealth than the typical Latino family and 10 times more wealth than the typical Black family. President Trump’s recession threatens to deepen existing inequities, as Black and Latino workers are less likely to work in jobs that can be done safely from home, less likely to have savings to fall back on, and less likely to be able to access unemployment insurance and other emergency programs electronically. That’s bad for our economy, bad for our democracy , and bad for the soul of our nation. That is why Democrats commit to forging a new social and economic contract with the American people— a contract that invests in the people and promotes shared prosperity , not one that benefits only big corporations and the wealthiest few. One that affirms housing is a right and not a privilege, and which makes a commitment that no one will be homeless or go hungry in the richest country on earth. A new economic contract that raises wages and restores workers’ rights to organize, join a union, and collectively bargain. One that at last supports working families and the middle class by securing equal pay for women and paid family leave for all. A new economic contract that provides access for all to reliable and affordable banking and financial services. A new social and economic contract that at last grapples honestly with America’s long and ongoing history of racism and disenfranchisement, of segregation and discrimination, and invests instead in building equity and mobility for the people of color who have been left out and left behind for generations. Democrats stand ready to take immediate, decisive action to pull the economy out of President Trump’s recession by investing in infrastructure , care work, clean energy, and small businesses to put Americans to work in good-paying jobs ; shoring up state and local budgets to save jobs and protect public health in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and enacting fundamental reforms to address structural and systemic racism and entrenched income and wealth inequality in our economy and our banking system. Protecting Workers and Families and Creating Millions of Jobs Across America Americans deserve an economy that works for everyone—not just for the wealthy and the well-connected. But our system has been rigged against the American people. Democrats believe that it is a moral and an economic imperative that we support working families by rebuilding the American middle class for the 21st century, making sure this time that everyone can make it and thrive, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, national origin, age, or ZIP code. Raising Wages and Promoting Workers’ Rights Democrats will fight to raise wages for working people and improve job quality and security, including by raising the federal minimum wage so it reaches $15 an hour by 2026. Raising the federal minimum wage, so fewer workers are forced to hold down multiple jobs to make ends meet, will significantly decrease risks of infection from COVID-19 and in the future. We know that strong American labor unions help increase wages and job standards for workers across the economy, which is why Democrats will prioritize passing the PRO Act and restoring workers’ rights, including the right to launch secondary boycotts. We will repeal so-called “right to work” laws that undermine worker power and lead to lower wages and less protection for workers across the economy, and ensure those who have been left without wage and hour protections for decades—including domestic workers and farmworkers—have the same rights as other workers. Democrats will support legislation to strengthen whistleblower and anti-retaliation protections for workers who speak for themselves or their coworkers. And we will take action to rein in anti-competitive corporate power by rewriting the rules that have undermined workers’ ability to advocate for themselves, including non-compete clauses, no-poaching agreements, and contracts that force workers into mandatory arbitration to resolve violations of employment laws. Democrats will recognize unions with majority sign-up—via “card check” processes— and ban captive audience meetings, which employers use to bully and browbeat workers. We will hold executives personally accountable if they interfere in workers’ efforts to organize, including issuing criminal penalties for intentional obstruction. We will take action to guarantee that when workers come to the table, they are able to bargain with the employers who actually hold the power, including franchisors, and penalize companies that bargain in bad faith with their workers. Democrats will vigorously protect all private-sector workers’ right to strike without fear of coercion, interference, and undue delay. We will also establish the federal government's role in promoting and facilitating collective bargaining and helping the parties bring their negotiations to a rapid and successful conclusion, committing to a high standard for intervening in strikes, including under the Railway Labor Act. The right of workers to come together and form a union is under attack. We must unrig the rules that block workers from having the union they want and update our labor laws to make it more possible. We must change labor law so that it is easier for unions and employers to enter into multi-employer agreements establishing minimum workplace standards related to wages, benefits, and working conditions. Democrats believe taxpayer dollars should never flow to employers who steal workers’ wages, violate labor laws, engage in union-busting, or exploit immigrant workers to depress working conditions for all workers. We will increase funding and staffing at the Department of Labor to aggressively enforce wage, hour, health, and safety rules across the economy. Democrats believe employees who are being misclassified, including gig and platform workers, deserve wage and workplace protections including minimum wage and overtime pay, and we support using the ABC test to determine employee status. Democrats believe that all workers should be able to hold their employers accountable for unpaid or underpaid wages, regardless of corporate structure. We support using grants and collaborative relationships with community organizations to ensure that workers know their rights and responsibilities under the law. Democrats will strengthen labor rights for the more than 20 million public-sector employees in the United States by passing the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act, which would provide a federal guarantee for public-sector employees to bargain for better pay and benefits and the working conditions they deserve. We cannot hope to raise wages without taking on the profound racial biases at work in our employment system. The wage gap between Black workers and white workers is higher today than it was 20 years ago. It takes a typical Black woman 19 months to earn what a typical white man earns in 12 months—and for typical Latinas and Native American women, it takes almost two years. Democrats believe we need to be much more proactive and aggressive in rooting out discrimination in our employment system. We will increase funding to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and increase its authority to initiate directed investigations into civil rights violations, violations of the rights of people with disabilities, and violations against LGBTQ+ people, especially transgender women of color. Federal contractors should be required to develop and disclose plans to recruit and promote people of color, women, LGBTQ+ people, people with disabilities, and veterans —and be held accountable for delivering. Enacting Robust Work-Family Policies The United States is alone among advanced economies in guaranteeing neither paid sick leave nor paid family leave for all workers. This puts excessive burdens on working families, and especially working mothers, even in the best of times, and is catastrophic for public health in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats will implement paid sick days and a high-quality, comprehensive, and inclusive paid family and medical leave system that protects workers from the unfair choice between attending to urgent health or caretaking needs and earning a paycheck. We will fight to ensure workers are guaranteed at least 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave for all workers and family units, to enable new parents to recover from childbirth and bond with their newborns, foster or adopted children, and allow all workers to take extended time off to care for themselves or ailing loved ones.. Finding and paying for high-quality child care is an emotional, logistical, and financial tightrope for too many parents, and that needs to change. Working parents shouldn’t have to choose between keeping their kids safe and earning a paycheck. Democrats will make major investments in quality, affordable child care, including by significantly increasing the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and providing access to affordable, high-quality child care on a sliding scale by boosting funding for grants to states to help low-income and middle-class families afford child care. We will improve compensation and benefits for child care providers and enact universal, high-quality pre-K programs for three- and four-year-olds. We will also invest in expanding long-term services and supports and home and community-based care for seniors and people with disabilities. Democrats will increase wages and benefits for paid caregivers in all settings, which will improve working conditions and quality of care while enabling family members to rejoin the workforce. Investing in the Engines of Job Creation Democrats believe the COVID-19 pandemic, and President Trump’s recession, demand unprecedented, transformational federal investments to create family-sustaining and union jobs. We believe that the world’s richest nation should have the world’s best infrastructure system. That’s why we will invest in resilient, sustainable, and inclusive infrastructure. Democrats will launch a clean energy revolution through historic investments in clean energy, clean transportation, energy efficiency, and advanced manufacturing. We will repair, modernize, and expand our highways, roads, bridges, and airports, including by installing 500,000 public charging stations for electric vehicles , ensuring our passenger transportation systems are resilient to the impacts of climate change, and using safe, modern design approaches that allow drivers, pedestrians, cyclists, and others to safely share the road. We will launch our country’s second great railroad revolution by investing in high-speed rail and passenger and freight rail systems, and commit to public transportation as a public good , including ensuring transit jobs are good jobs. This railroad revolution will reduce pollution, connect workers to good union jobs , slash commute times, and spur investment in rural communities that will now be better linked to major metropolitan areas. Democrats will invest to ensure passenger transportation, including public transit, is affordable to all and accessible to people with disabilities. We will help transform Amtrak from a laggard to a leader in passenger rail accessibility and ensure people with disabilities can receive compensation when disability equipment, like wheelchairs, are lost or damaged by transportation carriers. Democrats will upgrade our nation’s ports, lock and dam systems, and freight infrastructure to accommodate 21st century cargo, reduce air and water pollution , and create and maintain high-quality, good-paying jobs. We will increase demand for American-made ships by ensuring U.S. cargo is carried on ships flying our flag. We will make sure that every community in America has access to clean, reliable drinking water and safe wastewater systems in their homes, including by replacing dangerous lead pipes. We will increase investment in innovative water technologies, including water use efficiency, water conservation, and water reuse and recycling, that reduce water waste and consumer bills. We will modernize and green our public schools, and ensure they are accessible to students with disabilities. And Democrats will close the digital divide that deprives more than 20 million Americans of high-speed internet access by investing in broadband and 5G technology, including rural and municipal broadband, while ensuring those investments support good jobs and include strong protections for workers’ rights to organize, and restoring the FCC’s authority to take strong enforcement action against internet service providers who violate net neutrality principles. Democrats support the creation of an infrastructure bank, a public bank that will leverage public and private resources to build infrastructure projects of national or regional significance, including in rail and transit, clean energy and water infrastructure, broadband , and affordable housing. Projects that receive assistance from the bank will be required to follow Buy America and Buy Clean provisions, pay Davis-Bacon prevailing wages, utilize project labor agreements, and ensure employers remain neutral in workers’ organizing efforts. All federally supported infrastructure projects, whether existing or newly developed, financed through grants, loans, tax incentives, or a national infrastructure bank, should create good, union jobs that expand the middle class. That is why Democrats will ensure labor protections, Davis-Bacon wage standards, project labor agreements, collective bargaining neutrality, and domestic sourcing requirements are included in any infrastructure legislation, and will block anti-worker provisions, including forced arbitration. As we expand the clean energy technology and infrastructure industry; we will fight to enact legislation that will drive the creation of family sustaining jobs, with the high road labor standards with the provisions defined in the Good Jobs for the 21st Century Energy Act. Democrats support transparent, accountable, and sound management of publicly owned infrastructure and assets, and will ensure that local jurisdictions are adequately protected from partisan power grabs seeking to strip them of those assets. We will ensure robust federal oversight of any proposed transfers of ownership or operations, and will oppose any policy that promotes the privatization of public services or infrastructure. Democrats believe more products in our homes, stores, workplaces, and communities should be stamped “Made in America” and will expand support for American manufacturing. We will end policies that incentivize offshoring, and instead accelerate onshoring of critical supply chains , including in medical supplies and pharmaceuticals. We will expand effective tax credits that support domestic manufacturing and grow rural manufacturing jobs through investments in bio-based manufacturing. We will invest in innovation hubs and government programs to provide small manufacturers with technical and business expertise so they can grow their revenues and their workforces. Democrats support robust Buy America and Buy Clean standards for federally supported projects, which help increase demand for domestically produced and low-pollution raw materials. To ensure all workers can access the good jobs that will be created and supported by these investments and build a diverse pipeline of talent across the economy, Democrats will invest in career and technical education and high-quality job training programs with formal worker representation in program development, including pre-apprenticeship opportunities and registered apprenticeships . We believe in the value of lifelong learning, and will increase investments to support adult literacy and other skills development programs. Democrats know that small businesses are among the best job creators in our country. We will significantly boost funding for state small business grant and lending initiatives that generate tens of billions of dollars of private-sector investment, especially for small businesses owned by women and people of color. We will increase access to credit for small businesses in low-income and rural areas, including for unbanked or underbanked businesses. And we will increase funding for programs supporting businesses owned by women and people of color, including ending the Trump Administration’s effort to starve the Minority Business Development Agency, improving and expanding Small Business Administration (SBA) programs that most effectively support women- and minority-owned businesses, and increasing opportunities for women- and minority-owned businesses to obtain or participate in federal contracts. Democrats will invest in the American heartland and rural communities. We will make it easier for new and beginning farmers, aquaculture farmers, ranchers, and foresters, including returning veterans, to start and grow their operations by expanding U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) ownership and operating loan programs. Recognizing the history of racial discrimination in USDA’s core farming programs, Democrats will continue the reform efforts started under the Obama-Biden Administration to ensure USDA takes a more proactive approach to supporting training and resources for farmers of color. We will protect family farms and promote food security, including by taking steps to limit foreign ownership of U.S. farmland and reforming agricultural subsidies to better support small- and mid-sized farms. Democrats believe farmers should have the right to repair their own farming equipment, rather than being forced to rely on large corporations for even the simplest fixes. And we will expand domestic markets for family farmers and ranchers by developing and growing regional food systems to deliver fresh, American-grown produce to schools, hospitals, Department of Defense installations, and other major public institutions, so small, mid-size, and traditional farmers can stay competitive. Democrats will partner with America’s farmers, ranchers, and foresters to make the U.S. agriculture sector the first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions, which will spark a revolution in agriculture and open up new revenue streams for farmers in energy and waste products , and grow bio-based manufacturing jobs. We will grow the nation’s biofuels manufacturing sector, including by strengthening the Renewable Fuel Standard, supporting E15 blends , and supporting research, development, and deployment of advanced biofuels. We will expand popular, voluntary programs for sustainable and regenerative agricultural practices that help protect clean air and water and support wildlife habitats, including for threatened pollinators. Democrats will invest in research and development to support climate-resilient, sustainable, low-carbon, and organic agricultural methods. America’s farmworkers are essential to our economy, our communities, and our security. We will enforce labor and environmental protections for farmworkers, including overtime and safety rules protecting workers from exposure to pesticides and extreme heat, and ensure farmworkers are able to exercise their right to bargain collectively. Democrats will empower small and mid-size family farms by tackling market concentration in agriculture, including by strengthening enforcement of the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts and the Packers and Stockyards Act. We will also review federal guidelines to improve workers safety at facilities that raise and process meat for consumption, and use the federal government’s procurement power to incentivize the humane treatment of farm animals in accordance with commercially-recognized animal welfare standards. The United States has long been a world leader in science, technology, research, and innovation. Democrats oppose the Trump Administration’s efforts to undermine federal scientific research institutions, apply political screens to research grants, and interfere with the work of career scientists—actions which have a chilling effect on scientific discovery and are damaging to America’s economic competitiveness. Democrats will support historic federal investments in research, development, demonstration, and deployment, which will break new frontiers of science and create jobs across the country in aerospace, artificial intelligence, advanced materials, biotechnology, and clean energy and clean vehicles. Democrats support public investments in technology and innovation that help create a stronger economy for all Americans. We will support women innovators and innovators of color, encourage diversity in technology, and promote business models that reinvest in low-income communities and communities of color. Democrats continue to support the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and are committed to continuing space exploration and discovery. We believe in continuing the spirit of discovery that has animated NASA’s human space exploration, in addition to its scientific and medical research, technological innovation, and educational mission that allows us to better understand our own planet and place in the universe. We will strengthen support for the United States' role in space through our continued presence on the International Space Station, working in partnership with the international community to continue scientific and medical innovation. We support NASA's work to return Americans to the moon and go beyond to Mars, taking the next step in exploring our solar system. Democrats additionally support strengthening NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Earth observation missions to better understand how climate change is impacting our home planet. Building A Fair System of International Trade for Our Workers For too long, the global trading system has failed to keep its promises to American workers. Too many corporations have rushed to outsource jobs, and too many countries have broken their promises to be honest and transparent partners. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the risks of relying too heavily on global supply chains, as shutdowns and shortages have created chaos for workers and consumers and made our public health response even more challenging. The Trump Administration has failed time after time to deliver for American workers on this crucial issue, siding with corporate interests over our workers and launching a trade war with China that they have no plan for winning —creating incredible hardship for American farmers, manufacturers, workers, and consumers in the process. Democrats will pursue a trade policy that puts workers first. We will negotiate strong and enforceable standards for labor, human rights, and the environment in the core text of our trade deals. Future trade agreements should build on the pro-labor provisions added to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) by Democratic members of Congress. Democrats will take aggressive action against China or any other country that tries to undercut American manufacturing by manipulating their currencies and maintaining a misaligned exchange rate with the dollar, dumping products like steel and aluminum in our markets , or providing unfair subsidies. Unlike President Trump, we will stand up to efforts from China and other state actors to steal America’s intellectual property and will demand China and other countries cease and desist from conducting cyberespionage against our companies. We will eliminate President Trump’s tax and trade policies that encourage big corporations to ship jobs overseas and evade paying their fair share of taxes. If companies shut down their operations here and outsource jobs, we’ll claw back any public investments or benefits they received from taxpayers. And we will take immediate action to repair the damage President Trump’s reckless policies have done to American farmers, by working with our allies to stand up to China and negotiate from the strongest possible position. Putting Homeownership in Reach and Guaranteeing Safe Housing for Every American Homeownership is at the center of the American Dream —and yet it has never been in reach for all. Decades of red-lining, rising income inequality, and predatory lending practices targeting low-income families and people of color have made homeownership all but impossible for millions of working families. Homeownership has long been central to building generational wealth, and expanding access to homeownership to those who have been unfairly excluded and discriminated against is critical to closing the racial wealth gap. We have a nationwide shortage of affordable housing units, and tens of millions of Americans live in homes that pose risks to their health and safety. Homelessness has reached crisis proportions in a growing number of states, and housing costs that rise faster than wages have put the squeeze on renters in many of our biggest cities. Housing in America should be stable, accessible, safe, healthy, energy efficient, and, above all, affordable. No one should have to spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing, so families have ample resources left to meet their other needs and save for retirement. Democrats believe the government should take aggressive steps to increase the supply of housing, especially affordable housing, and address long-standing economic and racial inequities in our housing markets. We support innovative approaches to eliminating the racial wealth gap in America. Rehabilitating housing and expansion of housing owned by land trusts will increase the amount of housing available for secure homeownership. We will equalize access to affordable credit and improve access to down payment assistance to help families of color, low-income families, and rural buyers purchase homes. We will increase funding for assistance to first-time purchasers and homeowners to navigate the financing and servicing of their homes. We will create a new tax credit of up to $15,000 to help first-time homebuyers, and will make the tax credit refundable and advanceable, so buyers can get assistance at the time of purchase, instead of having to wait until they file their taxes. Democrats will supercharge investment in the Housing Trust Fund to greatly expand the number of affordable, accessible housing units on the market. We will expand the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit to incentivize private-sector construction of affordable housing, and make sure urban, suburban, and rural areas all benefit. We will make energy efficiency upgrades for millions of low-income households, affordable housing units, and public housing units in metropolitan and rural areas to save families money on their energy bills and provide safe and healthy homes. And Democrats will leverage existing programs, including at USDA, to build more affordable, accessible housing and retrofit existing housing in rural areas. We will ensure all federally supported housing projects, from new builds to retrofits, include mandatory requirements for labor standards, accessibility, and civil rights protections. Democrats are committed to ending homelessness in America. Democrats commit to providing Section 8 housing support for every eligible family, and will enact protections to keep landlords from discriminating against voucher recipients. We will increase investments in public housing to expand availability for the first time since the 1990s, and improve and upgrade existing public housing to ensure safe living conditions for residents , protecting tenants’ rights to return if extensive renovations are needed. Democrats support a housing-first approach to ending homelessness, because having a stable and safe place to live is essential to helping a person tackle any other challenges they may face, from mental illness to substance use disorders to post-traumatic stress disorder. We will act swiftly to end homelessness among veterans and will enact strong protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer youth, especially Black, Latino, and Native American LGBTQ+ youth, who too often find themselves on the streets. Democrats will enact a new Homeowner and Renter Bill of Rights to protect families from abusive lenders and landlords. We will empower renters by working to establish a national tenant right to organize, and support outreach and education to help tenants advocate to preserve and expand affordable housing. And Democrats will provide legal support to fight wrongful evictions. America’s history of using public policy and private lending restrictions to close neighborhoods off to Black families and other people of color and strip equity from their communities is long, painful, and unresolved to this day. The Trump Administration has made matters worse by gutting fair lending and fair housing protections for homeowners. Democrats will vigorously enforce the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act , the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule, and the disparate impact standard, and hold lenders accountable for discriminatory practices. We will also ensure that federal housing programs are better designed to affirmatively further fair housing. We will use the federal government to enforce settlements against discriminatory lenders, and require communities to proactively review housing patterns and remedy local policies that have a discriminatory effect. We will work to ensure that residential property and mortgage ownership records are publicly available and easily accessible, so that homeowners can always know who services their mortgage and who truly owns their debt. Democrats will give local elected officials tools and resources to combat gentrification, penalize predatory lending practices, and maintain homeownership, including exploring targeted rental relief when exorbitant rent increases force long-term residents from their communities and tackling persistent racial bias in appraisals that contributes to the racial wealth gap. Leveling the Economic Playing Field The U.S. economy is rigged against the American people. Time after time, President Trump and the Republicans have rewarded big corporations and their wealthy donors, and left working families behind. Democrats will take decisive action to level the playing field for people of color, working families, women, small business owners, and others who have been left on the sidelines. Reforming the Tax Code to Benefit Working Families Our tax system has been rigged against the American people by big corporations and their lobbyists, and by Republican politicians who dole out tax cuts to their biggest donors while leaving working families to struggle. Democrats will take action to reverse the Trump Administration’s tax cuts benefiting the wealthiest Americans and rewarding corporations for shipping American jobs overseas. We will crack down on overseas tax havens and close loopholes that are exploited by the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations. We will make sure the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes. We will make sure investors pay the same tax rates as workers and bring an end to expensive and unproductive tax loopholes, including the carried interest loophole. Corporate tax rates, which were cut sharply by the 2017 Republican tax cut, must be raised, and “trickle-down” tax cuts must be rejected. Estate taxes should also be raised back to the historical norm. Democrats will reform the tax code to be more progressive and equitable, and reduce barriers for working families to benefit from targeted tax breaks, including the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit. Our program of reform will provide immediate, marked relief for working families, including more generous, refundable tax credits to benefit low- and middle-income families, and easier and more equitable access to tax provisions that help working families build wealth, including by equalizing tax benefits for retirement contributions and providing more accessible tax breaks for homeownership. Curbing Wall Street Abuses The scars of the financial crisis that triggered the Great Recession are still present in our economy and our society. Financial institutions should never be “too big to fail.” Democrats will work to reverse the over-financialization of the American economy and curb Wall Street speculation by maintaining and expanding safeguards that separate retail banking institutions from more risky investment operations, and ensuring Wall Street investors pay their fair share in taxes. We will strengthen and enforce the Obama-Biden Administration’s Dodd-Frank financial reform law, including the Volcker Rule, to protect American workers from the impacts of future financial crises, and will support an updated and modernized version of Glass-Steagall. And when justified by the law, we will back criminal penalties for reckless executives who illegally gamble with the savings and economic security of their clients and American communities. Democrats will expand access to credit by creating a public credit reporting agency to provide a non-discriminatory credit reporting alternative to the private agencies, and will require its use by all federal lending programs, including home lending and student loans. And we will strengthen banking regulations, including the Community Reinvestment Act, to ensure equitable access to credit and banking products for all Americans, and reinvigorate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to ensure that banks, financial institutions, and lenders cannot prey on consumers. We commit to revisit and repeal sections of existing bankruptcy law that frequently lead to debtors losing their home as the result of medical debt, divorce, job loss, or just bad luck. We will also give bankruptcy judges the authority to ""cram down,"" or modify, mortgages for primary residences during bankruptcy proceedings, so working families can benefit from the same debt relief tools currently available to those who own assets like vacation homes and yachts. Ending Poverty Democrats remain committed to ending poverty and enabling all Americans to live up to their God-given potential. We recognize that the official poverty rate, as measured and communicated by the federal government, fails to capture critical needs like housing, education, health care, transportation, energy, and other necessities, and therefore understates the true share of Americans living in poverty. We will support the 10-20-30 funding approach, to direct at least 10 percent of federal funding to communities where 20 percent or more of the population has been living below the poverty line for 30 years or longer. Directing more federal investment to the communities most in need will help create jobs; improve and expand housing; modernize and expand transportation, clean water, wastewater, energy, and broadband infrastructure; and promote shared prosperity. We will raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and guarantee equal pay for women, two measures that in combination will pull millions of families out of poverty. We will make it easier for working families to benefit from targeted tax breaks, including the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, which too often go unclaimed by the lowest-income tax filers. We will significantly expand affordable housing and build new public housing for the first time since the 1990s, and guarantee Section 8 benefits to all who qualify —all of which will help reduce housing costs and increase housing availability for low-income families. Democrats believe health care is a human right. We will incentivize states to expand Medicaid and enroll low-income people who do not otherwise have health insurance in a new, high-quality public option without premiums. We will double investments in community health centers and rural health centers, and expand mobile health units, to make it easier for low-income people to access health care. In the wealthiest country on earth, it is a moral abomination that any child could ever go to bed hungry. Democrats will increase funding for food assistance programs, including SNAP, WIC, and school meals. We will also remove barriers that keep the formerly incarcerated from accessing food assistance. Cuts to the Legal Services Corporation have imperiled access to justice in civil court for low-income defendants and litigants alike in matters concerning access to public benefits and housing, eviction proceedings, and custodial cases. Democrats will significantly increase investment in the Legal Services Corporation to ensure those who cannot afford private representation can nevertheless equitably access the civil justice system and have their day in court. Democrats will provide substantially higher levels of support for programs and institutions that boost economic development in America’s most impoverished communities, including by doubling funding for CDFIs, expanding the Community Development Block Grant, increasing the number of Rural Business Investment Companies, and expanding and making permanent the New Markets Tax Credit. One in four American households are either unbanked or underbanked, putting them at risk of losing money due to exorbitant fees or usurious interest rates. Democrats will support and encourage efforts in Congress to guarantee affordable, transparent, and trustworthy banking services that are language-accessible for low- and middle-income families, including bank accounts and real-time payment systems through the Federal Reserve and easily accessible service locations, like postal banking. Protecting Consumer Rights and Privacy Consumers, workers, students, retirees, and investors who have been mistreated by businesses should never be denied their right to fight for fair treatment under the law. Democrats will support efforts to eliminate the use of forced arbitration clauses in employment and service contracts, which unfairly strip consumers, workers, students, retirees, and investors of their right to their day in court. In the 21st century—and especially in the COVID-19 pandemic—it is all but impossible for consumers, students, workers, and people with disabilities to opt out of using the internet to shop, socialize, learn, work, bank, and live. Democrats are committed to policies that will protect individuals’ privacy and data rights while continuing to support and enable innovation and improve accessibility in the technology sector. We will update the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights proposed by the Obama-Biden Administration, including adding strong national standards to protect consumers, employees, patients, and students from data breaches, and work with Congress to pass it into law. Democrats will take additional steps to protect student data privacy, particularly in preschool and K-12 settings where most students are under 18, and ensure that data collected in schools is used only for education, not for commercial purposes. And we support updating the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which has not been significantly amended since the 1980s, to afford the same protections to digital content as physical content. Tackling Runaway Corporate Concentration Democrats are concerned that the increase in corporate concentration across a wide range of industries, from hospitals and pharmaceutical companies to agribusiness and retail chains, could be stifling competition and innovation and creating monopoly conditions that harm consumers. We will direct federal regulators to review a subset of the mergers and acquisitions that have taken place since President Trump took office, prioritizing the pharmaceutical, health care, telecommunications, technology, and agricultural industries, to assess whether any have increased market concentration, raised consumer prices, demonstrably harmed workers, increased racial inequality, reduced competition, or constricted innovation, and assign appropriate remedies. Democrats will direct regulators to consider potential effects of future mergers on the labor market, on low-income and marginalized communities, and on racial equity, as well as on consumer prices and market competition. And as a last resort, regulators should consider breaking up corporations if they find they are using their market power to engage in anti-competitive activities. Guaranteeing a Secure and Dignified Retirement Democrats are proud to be the party that advocates retirement security for all. We are the party that created and strengthened Social Security, and defended public and private retirement plans that provide a decent monthly income. And we are fighting to make sure that all workers have the ability to save at work for emergencies and for retirement. Social Security is the most enduring thread in our nation’s social safety net. We will enact policies to make Social Security more progressive, including increasing benefits for all beneficiaries, meaningfully increasing minimum benefit payments, increasing benefits for long-duration beneficiaries, and protecting surviving spouses from benefit cuts. We will eliminate provisions that unfairly reduce public sector workers’ earned Social Security benefits. In light of weakened retirement security for unpaid caregivers and caregivers for family members, who sacrifice not only wages but Social Security benefits when they swap paid labor for unpaid care work, Democrats support Social Security reform which better accounts for the challenges facing unpaid caregivers— including incremental reforms to the benefit formula to mitigate the penalty for unpaid care. Democrats will reject every effort to cut, privatize, or weaken Social Security, including attempts to raise the retirement age, diminish benefits by cutting cost-of-living adjustments, or reduce earned benefits. We will ensure Social Security will be there forever. Democrats will protect Americans’ retirement security, especially in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and take action to protect public and private pensions to ensure workers keep the benefits they have earned, including through multiemployer plans. Democrats oppose changes to the multiemployer pension system that would endanger workers’ and retirees’ pensions, including composite pension plans. We support amending federal bankruptcy laws to protect workers’ earned pensions from being taken away by employers going through bankruptcy. We will also make it easier to save for retirement beyond Social Security. We will support approaches to retirement saving that enable workers and retirees to prepare for and prosper in retirement, including reforms that will allow states and municipalities to create public individual and pooled retirement account options that are easy for workers to access and understand. We will advocate federal legislation to make it easy for all workers to save, not just those in states or municipalities that have established their own programs. Democrats believe that when workers are saving for retirement, the financial advisors they consult should be legally obligated to put their client's best interests first. We will take immediate action to reverse the Trump Administration's regulations allowing financial advisors to prioritize their self-interest over their clients' financial wellbeing. And Democrats will equalize the network of retirement savings tax breaks so that working people can build their nest eggs faster, while also providing more equitable access to these accounts through automatic enrollment and relaxed contribution restrictions for unpaid caregivers. ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL, AFFORDABLE, QUALITY HEALTH CARE Democrats have fought to achieve universal health care for a century. We are proud to be the party of Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act. Because of the Obama-Biden Administration and the Affordable Care Act, more than 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions, from heart disease to asthma, are secure in the knowledge that insurance companies can no longer discriminate against them. Women can no longer be charged more than men just because of their gender. And more Americans are able to get health coverage than ever before. Democrats will keep up the fight until all Americans can access secure, affordable, high-quality health insurance —because as Democrats, we fundamentally believe health care is a right for all, not a privilege for the few. Unfortunately, at every turn, Democrats’ efforts to guarantee health coverage have been met by obstruction and opposition from the Republican Party. It has been Republicans who have embraced junk plans that undermine protections for pre-existing conditions. It was Republican state attorneys general who sued to block Medicaid expansion and Republican governors who refused to extend Medicaid coverage to their citizens, leaving millions of low-income Americans, disproportionately people of color, unable to access health coverage. And in the midst of the worst global pandemic in generations—one that has left more than 150,000 Americans dead and counting—the Trump Administration is fighting in court to invalidate the entirety of the Affordable Care Act and eliminate insurance for tens of millions of people. Overturning the Affordable Care Act remains a central plank of the Republican Party platform. The difference in values between the two parties on this life-or-death issue could not be more stark. The COVID-19 pandemic has made this difference in values painfully, brutally clear. President Trump has repeatedly downplayed the threat of the coronavirus, bullied governors for enacting life-saving public health measures, and left our frontline health care heroes without the equipment they need to protect themselves and the American people. The burdens of this pandemic have not been borne equally, as communities of color have suffered higher rates of infection and death, and struggled to access life-saving care when they need it most. Our essential workers have been deemed expendable by the President and his Administration. As Democrats, we say with one voice: no more. We are going to at last build the health care system the American people have always deserved: one that finally provides universal health care coverage; reduces prescription drug prices, premiums, and out-of-pocket costs ; reins in overall health care expenses; and tackles the deep-seated inequities in our health care system. We will build a health care system that is driven by the needs of patients and the people who care for them, instead of the profit motives of corporations. We will tackle entrenched racial disparities in health care, reduce prescription drug prices by standing up to big pharmaceutical companies , and make it easier to access mental health and substance use disorder treatment and long-term services and supports in metropolitan and rural areas alike. Democrats will always fight to save Americans’ lives by making it easier and more affordable to go to the doctor, get prescription medicines, and access preventive testing and treatments. Generations of Democrats have been united in the fight for universal health care. We are proud our party welcomes advocates who want to build on and strengthen the Affordable Care Act and those who support a Medicare for All approach; all are critical to ensuring that health care is a human right. Securing Universal Health Care Through a Public Option Democrats believe we need to protect, strengthen, and build upon our bedrock health care programs, including the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Veterans Affairs (VA) system. Private insurers need real competition to ensure they have incentive to provide affordable, quality coverage to every American. To achieve that objective, we will give all Americans the choice to select a high-quality, affordable public option through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The public option will provide at least one plan choice without deductibles; will be administered by CMS, not private companies; and will cover all primary care without any co-payments and control costs for other treatments by negotiating prices with doctors and hospitals, just like Medicare does on behalf of older people. Everyone will be eligible to choose the public option or another Affordable Care Act marketplace plan. To help close the persistent racial gap in insurance rates, Democrats will expand funding for Affordable Care Act outreach and enrollment programs, so every American knows their options for securing quality, affordable coverage. The lowest-income Americans, including more than four million adults who should be eligible for Medicaid but who live in states where Republican governors have refused to expand the program, will be automatically enrolled in the public option without premiums; they may opt out at any time. And we will enable millions of older workers to choose between their employer-provided plans, the public option, or enrolling in Medicare when they turn 60, instead of having to wait until they are 65. Democrats are categorically opposed to raising the Medicare retirement age. Democrats will also empower the states, as laboratories of democracy, to use Affordable Care Act innovation waivers to develop locally tailored approaches to health coverage, including by removing barriers to states that seek to experiment with statewide universal health care approaches. We also know that finally covering every American through the public and private insurance system alone is not enough to guarantee universal access. That is why Democrats support doubling investments in community health centers and rural health clinics in underserved urban and rural areas, including increased support for dental care, mental health care, and substance use services like medication-assisted treatment, and why we will increase support for mobile health clinics. We will enact longer, multi-year funding cycles for these critical health services so they can operate with greater certainty, as community health centers are the nation’s only providers that are required by law to be both located in medically underserved areas and required to serve all who seek care, regardless of their ability to pay. And we will leverage innovative payment options through Medicare and Medicaid to help community health centers and rural health clinics keep their doors open. We will expand the National Health Service Corps and Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program to grow a diverse primary care workforce and to address critical shortages of health care providers in medically underserved rural and urban areas, including primary care nurses, dental professionals, and mental health and substance use counselors. Democrats will also increase monitoring and enforcement to ensure that health care facilities are accessible to people with disabilities. Bringing Down Drug Prices and Taking on the Pharmaceutical Industry Too many Americans struggle to afford the prescription drugs they need to get or stay healthy. No American should find themselves foregoing or rationing medications because they can’t afford to pay— especially when taxpayer money underwrites research leading to the development of many prescription drugs in the first place. Democrats will take aggressive action to ensure that Americans do not pay more for prescription drugs than people in other advanced economies, and ensure that all necessary medications are covered. We will empower Medicare to at last be able to negotiate prescription drug prices for all public and private purchasers—for families and businesses, as well as older Americans—no matter where they get their coverage. We will also prevent the price of brand-name and outlier generic drugs from rising faster than the inflation rate. We will cap out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors, and ensure that effective treatments for chronic health conditions are available at little or no cost. For too long, prescription drug companies have gamed the system to justify their price increases by any means available. Democrats will crack down on anti-competitive efforts to manipulate the patent system or collude on prices. And we will eliminate tax breaks for prescription drug advertisements. Reducing Health Care Costs and Improving Health Care Quality The United States spends more per capita on health care than any other advanced economy, and has less to show for it. Health care costs have been increasing for decades, with average premiums for an employer-provided family plan topping $20,000 in 2019. Democrats know we can reduce out-of-pocket costs for families while improving the quality of health care for all. We will make it easier for working families to afford high-quality insurance in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces by ensuring that no one pays more than 8.5 percent of their income in premiums and eliminating the cap on subsidies. Democrats believe that when Americans are in the hospital or an emergency room, they shouldn’t have to worry about whether their health care providers are in-network or not, which is why we will outlaw the predatory practice of surprise medical billing. We will work to increase price transparency in the health care system across all payers, and reduce paperwork through uniform medical billing. And we will vigorously use antitrust laws to fight against mega-mergers in the hospital, insurance, and pharmaceutical industries that would raise prices for patients by undermining market competition. Excessive prescription drug cost-sharing and voids in coverage such as dental, vision, and hearing services can lead to severe health consequences for Medicare patients. Democrats will fight any efforts to cut Medicare benefits, and support finding financially sustainable policies to expand Medicare to cover dental, vision, and hearing. Democrats will support policies that increase the number of primary care practitioners, registered nurses, dentists, and dental therapists, especially in rural and low-income metropolitan areas, so it’s easier for every American to access preventive and primary health care. Democrats value all people and will actively promote wellness programs for all ages in our diverse communities for better overall health. Expanding Access to Mental Health and Substance Use Treatment Every American who needs it should be able to access mental health care or substance use disorder treatment, no matter where they live. Democrats will aggressively enforce the federal mental health and substance use disorder parity law and ensure that health insurers adequately cover mental health and substance use treatment. We will also invest in training and hiring more mental health providers, substance use disorder counselors, and peer support counselors, including by expanding funding for health clinics, especially in rural areas, and increasing access to these services through Medicaid. Trauma has a profound effect on both mental and physical health, and Democrats will support increased training for health care professionals, educators, social workers, and other care workers in trauma-informed care and practices. We will oppose efforts to weaken HIPAA and FERPA privacy rights of people with mental illness. The opioid epidemic has devastated American communities, and the Trump Administration has completely failed in its response, leaving millions of families desperate for help. Democrats will make medication-assisted treatment available to all who need it, and will require publicly supported health clinics to offer medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction and approved treatments for other substance use disorders. We believe we must stop over-prescribing while improving access to effective and needed pain management. Democrats recognize that incarcerated people suffer from serious mental health and substance use disorders at higher rates than the general population, which is why we will support expanded access to mental health and substance use disorder care in prisons and for returning citizens. We will ensure no one is incarcerated solely for drug use, and support increased use of drug courts, harm reduction interventions, and treatment diversion programs for those struggling with substance use disorders. Expanding Long-Term Care Services and Supports The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of people who reside in institutional settings, such as nursing homes and independent living facilities, and made clear that biases within Medicaid create undue barriers to home- and community-based long-term services and supports. Democrats will work to eliminate waiting lists for home and community-based care and the institutional bias within Medicaid, making investments in building the capacity of the Medicaid system to provide home and community-based services. We will modernize Medicaid eligibility so people with disabilities do not have to work low-wage jobs to access needed services, and to ensure the spouses of people with disabilities can maintain a certain level of income and assets. We will also help Americans pay for long-term care by creating a tax credit for informal and family caregivers and increasing the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit. Democrats will also pursue policies to improve nursing home staffing and quality standards, strengthen accreditation processes, and combat corporate abuses in nursing homes and independent living facilities. And Democrats are strongly committed to protecting and enforcing the Americans with Disabilities Act and fulfilling the promise of the Olmstead v. L.C. decision, which found institutional segregation of people with disabilities to be unlawful. Eliminate Racial, Gender, and Geographic Health Inequities The national statistics on American health care mask profound disparities in insurance rates, access to primary and specialized care, and disparate health outcomes, which are a symptom of those disparities in access. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the uninsured rate was nearly three times higher for Latinos and nearly twice as high for Black Americans as it was for whites. Some segments of the Asian American and Pacific Islander population faced uninsured rates rivaling those of Black Americans and Latinos, and more than one in five Native Americans and Alaska Natives was uninsured. Black children are far more likely than white children to suffer from asthma. Latinos, Native Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and Black Americans are diagnosed with diabetes at higher rates than whites. And average life expectancy is more than two years lower for rural Americans compared to those who live in metropolitan areas. We recognize it is not enough to have a commitment to eliminating health disparities: we must have a plan. That is why Democrats will launch a sustained, government-wide effort, with leadership at the highest levels, to eliminate racial, ethnic, gender, and geographic gaps in insurance rates, access to quality care, and health outcomes. That includes tackling the social, economic, and environmental inequities—the social determinants of health like poor housing, hunger, inadequate transportation, mass incarceration, air and water pollution, and gun violence— that contribute to worse health outcomes for low-income Americans and people of color. We can and must fix these inequities by expanding coverage, making health care more affordable, and tackling implicit bias in our health care system. Democrats will ensure that people with disabilities are never denied coverage based on the use of quality-adjusted life year (QALY) indexes. Democrats will ensure federal data collection and analysis is adequately funded and designed to allow for disaggregation by race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, geography, disability status, national origin, and other important variables, so that disparities in health coverage, access, and outcomes can be better understood and addressed. We will expand access to health care for people living and working across the United States by extending Affordable Care Act coverage to Dreamers, and working with Congress to lift the five-year waiting period for Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program eligibility for low-income, lawfully present immigrants. Democrats remain committed to ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which disproportionately affects communities of color and the LGBTQ+ community, and will support critical investments under the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program and the Minority HIV/AIDS Fund. Protecting Native American Health Native American tribes have for too long been forced to cope with insufficient access to health care and mental health services, nutrition services, and modern infrastructure. Democrats are committed to pursuing environmental justice and climate justice, including for Indigenous peoples and communities, and will invest significant new resources in clean water and wastewater infrastructure, clean energy generation and distribution, and sustainable and regenerative agriculture. And we will make mandatory and work toward full funding for the Indian Health Service as part of our commitment to pursuing strong nation-to-nation relationships and honoring the United States’ trust obligations to Native American communities. Securing Reproductive Health, Rights, and Justice Democrats are committed to protecting and advancing reproductive health, rights, and justice. We believe unequivocally, like the majority of Americans, that every woman should be able to access high-quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion. We will repeal the Title X domestic gag rule and restore federal funding for Planned Parenthood, which provides vital preventive and reproductive health care for millions of people, especially low-income people, and people of color, and LGBTQ+ people, including in underserved areas. Democrats oppose and will fight to overturn federal and state laws that create barriers to reproductive health and rights. We will repeal the Hyde Amendment, and protect and codify the right to reproductive freedom. We condemn acts of violence, harassment, and intimidation of reproductive health providers, patients, and staff. We will address the discrimination and barriers that inhibit meaningful access to reproductive health care services, including those based on gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, income, disability, geography, and other factors. Democrats oppose restrictions on medication abortion care that are inconsistent with the most recent medical and scientific evidence and that do not protect public health. We recognize that quality, affordable comprehensive health care; medically accurate, LGBTQ+ inclusive, age-appropriate sex education; and the full range of family planning services are all essential to ensuring that people can decide if, when, and how to start a family. We are proud to be the party of the Affordable Care Act, which prohibits discrimination in health care on the basis of sex and requires insurers to cover prescription contraceptives at no cost. These efforts have significantly reduced teen and unintended pregnancies by making it easier to decide whether, when, and how to have a child. We believe that a person's health should always come first. Democrats will protect the rights of all people to make personal health care decisions, and will reject the Trump Administration’s use of broad exemptions to allow medical providers, employers, and others to discriminate. Protecting and Promoting Maternal Health Black women are more than three times as likely to die from complications of pregnancy and childbirth compared to white women. To save mothers’ lives, Democrats will expand postpartum Medicaid coverage to a full year after giving birth, invest in rural maternal health, promote a diverse perinatal workforce, and implement implicit bias training for health professionals. We will support comprehensive solutions to address every dimension of the Black maternal health crisis in America and eliminate all racial and ethnic disparities in maternal health outcomes, and support policies and approaches that will at least halve our nation’s unacceptably high maternal mortality rate. We strongly and unequivocally support the decision to have a child, including by ensuring a safe and healthy pregnancy and childbirth, and by providing services during pregnancy and after the birth of a child, including adoption and social support services, as well as protections against pregnancy discrimination. We are committed to creating a society where children are safe and can thrive physically, emotionally, educationally, and spiritually. Protecting LGBTQ+ Health We condemn the Trump Administration’s discriminatory actions against the LGBTQ+ community, including the dangerous and unethical regulations allowing doctors, hospitals, and insurance companies to discriminate against patients based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. Democrats will reverse this rulemaking and restore nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ+ people and people living with HIV/AIDS in health insurance, including coverage of all medically necessary care for gender transition. We will also take action to guarantee that LGBTQ+ people and those living with HIV/AIDS have full access to needed health care and resources, including by requiring that federal health plans provide coverage for HIV/AIDS testing and treatment and HIV prevention medications like PrEP and PEP, gender confirmation surgery, and hormone therapy. Democrats support increased community HIV prevention and testing programs which target Latino, Black, Asian American and Pacific Islander, Native American, and other at-risk communities to address the increases of HIV. Democrats will recommit the federal government to ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2025. Democrats are proud that the Obama-Biden Administration lifted the discriminatory lifetime ban on blood donation by healthy gay and bisexual Americans. We will work to ensure blood donation regulations are based on science, not fiction or stigma and that no American, when seeking to donate blood, will face more stringent limitations than any other simply because of who they are. Strengthening and Supporting the Health Care Workforce The COVID-19 pandemic has made plain to people across the country that our health care workers are heroes. Our doctors and nurses, our home health aides and physician’s assistants, our public health professionals, our home care workers and nursing home workers, and our cleaners and service workers have shown up to work every day despite dire shortages of personal protective equipment. Far too many of them have lost their lives to this terrible disease, and untold thousands are suffering the mental and emotional strain of losing far too many patients. And yet, despite the critical role they play in our society and our economy, these frontline workers—a majority of whom are women of color—are often underpaid and lack access to paid sick days, paid family and medical leave, health insurance, and other benefits critical for their own health and the health of patients. Democrats believe that all jobs in the caring economy must come with family-sustaining wages, good benefits, access to paid leave, fair and predictable schedules, access to training and professional development, and the ability to join a union and collectively bargain. We believe all employers funded by taxpayer dollars must pay their workers at least $15 an hour and protect workers’ rights to organize. Although health care jobs are among the fastest growing in the economy, demand for services still far outstrips supply, especially in primary care. We will invest in community health worker care-forces around the nation proven to prevent, manage, and better treat chronic illnesses, and empower first-time mothers with home visiting. We will close provider gaps and increase diversity in the health care profession by creating a robust pipeline of talent with career ladders for advancement. And we will also increase opportunities for community health workers to come from the communities they serve. Investing in Health Science and Research Scientific research is at the heart of medicine—and of health care. Democrats want the United States to be at the forefront of scientific research and discovery for the benefit of our people, our economy, and our global competitiveness. We will support increased and sustainable funding for health and medical research and federal grants across agencies, including at the National Cancer Institute and other components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the CDC, and the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality. We will increase the federal investment in research and development for new medications through the NIH, and make sure that there is a return on that investment for taxpayers. We will also build on the foundation of the Obama-Biden Administration’s Cancer Moonshot to break down silos and accelerate research into cancer and cancer treatments by creating an agency with the sole mission of finding new cures and treatments for cancer and other diseases. Democrats also support increasing funding for research into health disparities by race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, geographic area, and socioeconomic status, with a particular focus on how the social determinants of health contribute to differences in health outcomes. We support fully integrating people with disabilities in all stages of health and medical research to ensure outcomes reflect the true needs of Americans with disabilities. Democrats will take steps to increase the diversity of principal investigators receiving federal grants, as well as of participants in federally supported clinical trials, to improve the quality and applicability of our medical research for women and people of color, who are too often left out of research on disease and medical responses to treatment options. The Trump Administration’s systematic efforts to undermine, discredit, dismiss, fire, disempower, and diminish the contributions of scientists, in health science and other disciplines, have weakened our public institutions, slowed the pace of scientific inquiry, and profoundly damaged America’s standing in the world. Democrats will protect the independence and intellectual freedom of scientists, whether they are employed by the federal government or receiving federal grants in support of their research, and take steps to shield our scientific research agencies from future political interference. PROTECTING COMMUNITIES AND BUILDING TRUST BY REFORMING OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM Our criminal justice system is failing to keep communities safe—and failing to deliver justice. America is the land of the free, and yet more of our people are behind bars, per capita, than anywhere else in the world. Instead of making evidence-based investments in education, jobs, health care, and housing that are proven to keep communities safe and prevent crime from occurring in the first place, our system has criminalized poverty, overpoliced and underserved Black and Latino communities, and cut public services. Instead of offering the incarcerated the opportunity to turn their lives around, our prisons are overcrowded and continue to rely on inhumane methods of punishment. Instead of treating those who have served their time as full citizens upon their return to society, too many of our laws continue to punish the formerly incarcerated, erecting barriers to housing, employment, and voting rights for millions of Americans. Democrats believe we need to overhaul the criminal justice system from top to bottom. Police brutality is a stain on the soul of our nation. It is unacceptable that millions of people in our country have good reason to fear they may lose their lives in a routine traffic stop, or while standing on a street corner, or while playing with a toy in a public park. It is unacceptable that Black parents must have “the talk” with their children, to try to protect them from the very police officers who are supposed to be sworn to protect and serve them. It is unacceptable that more than 1,000 people, a quarter of them Black, have been killed by police every year since 2015. Democrats also recognize that all too often, systematic cuts to public services have left police officers on the front lines of responding to social challenges for which they have not been trained, from homelessness to mental health crises to the opioid epidemic. We can and must do better for our communities. Democrats know we can end the era of mass incarceration and dramatically reduce the number of Americans held in jails and prisons while continuing to reduce crime rates, which have fallen steadily from their peak nearly three decades ago. This is the moment to root out structural and systemic racism in our criminal justice system and our society, and reimagine public safety for the benefit of our people and the character of our country. We must start by preventing people from entering the criminal justice system in the first place. Democrats believe we must break the school-to-prison pipeline that too often relies on arrests and law enforcement to address misbehavior that ought to be handled and deescalated within the school.. We support re-issuing federal guidance from the Department of Education and the Department of Justice to prevent the disparate disciplinary treatment of children of color and children with disabilities in school and educational settings. Democrats believe every school should have sufficient funding to employ guidance counselors, social workers, nurses, or school psychologists to help guarantee age-appropriate and racially equitable student disciplinary practices, rather than turning to police to resolve these issues. A growing number of states have recognized it is unjust—and unjustifiable—to punish children and teenagers as harshly as adults. We believe that if you aren’t old enough to drink, you aren’t old enough to be sentenced to life without parole. The federal government will incentivize states to stop incarcerating kids, and develop community-based alternatives to prison and detention centers for youth and invest in after-school programs, community centers, and summer jobs to provide opportunities for young people at risk. And Democrats believe that children who do enter the juvenile justice system should be given a true second chance, including by automatically sealing and expunging juvenile records. Democrats believe we must ensure real accountability for individual and systemic misconduct in our police departments, prevent law enforcement from becoming unnecessarily entangled in the everyday lives of Americans, and reimagine policing for the benefit and safety of the American people. In recent years, some innovative police departments have enacted evidence-based reforms to change their approach by investing in robust training and putting in place—and, even more crucially, enforcing—strong standards governing conflict resolution, de-escalation, and use of force. We must build on these evidence-based approaches and implement them nationwide. Democrats will establish strict national standards governing the use of force, including banning the use of chokeholds and carotid holds and permitting deadly force only when necessary and a last resort to prevent an imminent threat to life. Americans must feel safe when they are asleep in their own homes. We will work to establish “no-knock warrants” standards. The risk of mistakes and unintended consequences is too great. We will require immediate application of these standards to all federal law enforcement agencies and condition federal grants on their adoption at the state and local level. We will require officer training in effective nonviolent tactics, appropriate use of force, implicit bias, and peer intervention, both at the academy and on the job. And we will ban racial and religious profiling in law enforcement. Democrats will support measures to improve training and education for judges, corrections officers, prosecutors, public defenders, and police officers to ensure transgender and gender non-conforming people receive fair and equitable treatment in the criminal justice system. It is past time to end the failed “War on Drugs,” which has imprisoned millions of Americans —disproportionately Black people and Latinos— and hasn’t been effective in reducing drug use. Democrats support policies that will reorient our public safety approach toward prevention, and away from over-policing —including by making evidence-based investments in jobs, housing, education, and the arts that will make our nation fairer, freer, and more prosperous. Democrats will reinvigorate community policing approaches, so officers on the beat better serve the neighborhoods they work in, and make smart investments to incentivize departments to build effective partnerships with social workers and mental health and substance use counselors to help respond to public health challenges. Body cameras are not a panacea, but Democrats believe they can help improve accountability and transparency; we support their continued use and will take steps to improve compliance, require their use in blended federal-local task forces, and promulgate best practices to protect personal privacy. Democrats believe weapons of war have no place on our streets, and will once again limit the sale and transfer of surplus military weapons to domestic law enforcement agencies —a policy President Trump reversed immediately upon taking office. We cannot create trust without holding those in power accountable for their actions. Democrats will reinvigorate pattern-or-practice investigations into police misconduct at the Department of Justice, and strengthen them through new subpoena powers and expanded oversight to address systemic misconduct by prosecutors. Far too often, the law has shielded police officers who stand accused of heinous violations of civil and human rights. Democrats support lowering the intent standard for federally prosecuting law enforcement officials for civil rights violations. We will also act to ensure that victims of federal, state, or local law enforcement abuses of power can seek justice through civil litigation by reining in the doctrine of qualified immunity. The American people deserve access to timely and accurate data on activities supported by their tax dollars, including policing. We will collect and publish data on the use of force in police departments across the country to promote transparency and accountability. To increase transparency and improve federal, state, and local law enforcement hiring practices, Democrats will also establish a national registry of officers who have been found to have abused their power. Democrats also support measures to increase diversity among the ranks of police departments, so our law enforcement agencies look more like the communities they serve. And we will seek increased funding for officer health and well-being in police departments across the country, including for personal safety equipment and mental health services. Substance use disorders are diseases, not crimes. Democrats believe no one should be in prison solely because they use drugs. Democrats will decriminalize marijuana use and reschedule it through executive action on the federal level. We will support legalization of medical marijuana, and believe states should be able to make their own decisions about recreational use. The Justice Department should not launch federal prosecutions of conduct that is legal at the state level. All past criminal convictions for cannabis use should be automatically expunged. And rather than involving the criminal justice system, Democrats support increased use of drug courts, harm reduction interventions, and treatment diversion programs for those struggling with substance use disorders. Poverty is not a crime, and it should not be treated as one. Democrats support eliminating the use of cash bail and believe no one should be imprisoned merely for failing to pay fines or fees, or have their driver's licenses revoked for unpaid tickets or simple violations. Equal justice under the law should not be contingent on the ability to pay for quality legal representation, which is why we support increasing funding for public defenders and for the Legal Services Corporation. Since 1990, the United States has grown by one-third, the number of cases in federal district courts has increased by 38 percent, federal circuit court filings have risen by 40 percent, and federal cases involving a felony defendant are up 60 percent, but we have not expanded the federal judiciary to reflect this reality in nearly 30 years. Democrats will commit to creating new federal district and circuit judgeships consistent with recommendations from the Judicial Conference. Sentencing decisions should be based on the facts of each case, including the severity of the offense and individuals’ circumstances. Democrats support allowing judges to determine appropriate sentences, which is why we will fight to repeal federal mandatory minimums, incentivize states to do the same, and make all sentencing reductions retroactive so judges can reconsider past cases where their hands were tied. We believe it is long past time to end the federal sentencing disparity between crack and powdered cocaine, which has contributed to the disproportionate imprisonment of people of color. And Democrats continue to support abolishing the death penalty. Our courts should reflect our country. Democrats will appoint people to the bench who are committed to seeing justice be served, and treating each case on its merits. We will nominate and confirm federal judges who have diverse backgrounds and experiences, including as public defenders, legal aid attorneys, and civil rights lawyers. Democrats are proud that the Obama-Biden Administration commuted the sentences of more than 1,700 people serving unjust sentences following thorough review of their individual cases, and we support the continued use of the President’s clemency powers to secure the release of those serving unduly long sentences. We denounce President Trump’s inappropriate use of clemency to help his friends and political cronies avoid justice. We also support establishing an independent clemency board to ensure an appropriate, effective process for using clemency, especially to address systemic racism and other priorities. Private profit should not motivate the provision of vital public services, including in the criminal justice system. Democrats support ending the use of private prisons and private detention centers, and will take steps to eliminate profiteering from diversion programs, commercial bail, electronic monitoring, prison commissaries, and reentry and treatment programs. Democrats believe prisoners should have a meaningful opportunity to challenge wrongful convictions and unconstitutional conditions in prisons. We also believe that too many of our jails and prisons subject people to inhumane treatment, and will work to end practices like solitary confinement for adults and juveniles, ban the use of restraints on pregnant federal inmates, and ban the use of chokeholds and carotid holds. Incarcerated people must not be denied access to vital medical care or unnecessarily exposed to disease, as they have been during the COVID-19 pandemic. And Democrats will pursue a holistic approach to rehabilitation, increasing support for programs that provide educational opportunities, including pursuing college degrees, for those in the criminal justice system, both in prison and upon release. Democrats believe in redemption. We must deepen our commitment to helping those who have served their time re-enter society, earn a good living, and participate in our democracy as the full citizens they are. We support the automatic expungement of certain criminal records for those that have been fully acquitted, wrongfully convicted, or pardoned by the executive. We will aim to ensure access to transitional housing for returning citizens, support expanded access to mental health and substance use treatment, and will stop the practice of reincarcerating people for technical violations of probation or parole. Democrats support federal and state efforts to “ban the box” and will make it easier for returning citizens to access work opportunities through the Job Corps. The formerly incarcerated should not be blocked from exercising their voting rights or accessing public services, including Pell Grants and nutrition assistance, available to other free citizens of the United States. Continuing to punish a person after they have rejoined the community is both cruel and counterproductive. HEALING THE SOUL OF AMERICA Democrats believe in bringing the American people together, not stoking division and distrust. President Trump has denigrated virtually every segment of American society —and in so doing, he has insulted the very idea of America itself. Healing the soul of America means facing up to the deepest inequities in our society, from structural racism to misogyny to discrimination against people with disabilities, and enacting ambitious measures to fix them. Protecting Americans’ Civil Rights Democrats are committed to ending discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, language, gender, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability status. We will appoint U.S. Supreme Court justices and federal judges who look like America, are committed to the rule of law, will uphold individual civil rights and civil liberties as essential components of a free and democratic society, and will respect and enforce foundational precedents, including Brown v. Board of Education and Roe v. Wade . Democrats are committed to restoring the full power of the Voting Rights Act and ensuring every citizen can access the ballot box. We will enforce and strengthen the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, and will end racial and religious profiling in law enforcement. President Trump’s words and actions have given safe harbor and encouragement to racists, anti-Semites, anti-Muslim bigots, and white supremacists. It’s time to root out domestic terrorism in all its forms. We will use federal law enforcement tools and resources to address domestic terrorism, and if necessary work with Congress to pass a domestic terrorism law that is consistent with the Constitutional right to free speech and civil liberties. Achieving Racial Justice and Equity Historic wrongs and abuses perpetrated against Native Americans, two and a half centuries of slavery, a hundred years of Jim Crow segregation, and a history of exclusionary immigration policies have created profound and lasting inequities in income, wealth, education, employment, housing, environmental quality, and health care for communities of color. Democrats are committed to standing up to racism and bigotry in our laws, in our culture, in our politics, and in our society, and recognize that race-neutral policies are not sufficient to rectify race-based disparities. We will take a comprehensive approach to embed racial justice in every element of our governing agenda, including in jobs and job creation, workforce and economic development, small business and entrepreneurship, eliminating poverty and closing the racial wealth gap, promoting asset building and homeownership, education, health care, criminal justice reform, environmental justice, and voting rights. Democrats will ensure federal data collection and analysis is adequately funded and designed to allow for disaggregation by race and ethnicity, among other important factors, to better design policies to address the needs of the most vulnerable communities and make informed policy choices. Hate and its symbols have no home in America. Democrats believe that we can only build a more just and equitable future if we honestly reckon with our history and its legacy in the present. We support removing the Confederate battle flag and statues of Confederate leaders from public properties. We recognize Black history has too often been intentionally suppressed or excluded from our history books, and will invest in recovering, celebrating, and highlighting Black history as American history. Democrats believe Juneteenth (June 19th) represents the end of slavery, the freedom for millions of enslaved Black Americans, and should be recognized as a federal holiday. We believe Black lives matter, and will establish a national commission to examine the lasting economic effects of slavery, Jim Crow segregation, and racially discriminatory federal policies on income, wealth, educational, health, and employment outcomes; to pursue truth and promote racial healing; and to study reparations. We must acknowledge that there can be no realization of the American dream without grappling with the lasting effects of slavery, and facing up to the centuries-long campaign of violence, fear, and trauma wrought upon Black Americans. The extreme gap in household wealth and income between people of color—especially Black Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and certain Asian American and Pacific Islander communities—and white families is hurting our working class and holding our country back. Democrats are committed to improving economic mobility for people of color. We will fight to tackle intergenerational poverty and close the racial wealth gap. Democrats support policies to end discrimination and unfair practices in the housing market, will empower local governments to combat gentrification trends that disproportionately harm long-time residents of color, and will create a Community Restoration Fund to repair the toxic legacy of historic investments in transportation that were designed to enforce racial segregation. We will equalize access to credit and expand support for first-time homebuyers to make homeownership and the wealth-building it creates more accessible for people of color. Democrats recognize that racial wealth gaps are rooted in longstanding discrimination and unjust policies. We will equalize established pathways for building wealth while exploring innovative approaches to closing racial wealth gaps, including policies that provide seed capital in order to access the economic security of asset ownership. The right to organize and collectively bargain benefits all workers, but especially for workers of color. Unions close pay gaps between white workers and people of color. The union wage premium is high for all workers, but remains especially substantial for people of color, including Latinos and Black workers. This is one reason why Black workers represent a higher share of the labor movement than the workforce as a whole. Unemployment rates for people of color are persistently higher than the national average, which is why Democrats support making racial equity part of the mandate of the Federal Reserve. Specifically, we will work with Congress to direct the Chair of the Federal Reserve to report on the extent of racial employment and wage gaps, and how the central bank is countering them, in addition to monitoring, reporting on, and responding to macroeconomic conditions in general. We will invest in low-income communities, urban and rural areas, and communities of color by strengthening the Community Reinvestment Act, improving federal support and access to credit for women- and minority-owned small businesses, expanding and making permanent the New Markets Tax Credit, and doubling funding for CDFIs. We will restore and build on the Obama-Biden Administration’s Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces policy, and use the purchasing power of the federal government to incentivize private companies to recruit and advance people of color, women, people with disabilities, and veterans. Democrats believe it is unacceptable that schools are more segregated today than they were in the late 1960s. We believe education is a critical public good, and will increase investments to guarantee all students can access high-quality public schools, no matter where they live, so students of color are well prepared to thrive in college and careers. We will break the school-to-prison pipeline that sees children of color disproportionately punished by the criminal justice system for disciplinary issues that should be handled by school administrators or counselors. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has disproportionately sickened and killed Black Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and certain Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, has made long-standing racial and geographic disparities in health care and health outcomes into front-page news. Democrats will launch an all-of-government effort to eliminate health disparities, including by achieving universal health coverage through a high-quality, affordable public option; expanding funding for community health centers, rural health centers, and mobile health clinics; and tackling environmental racism that sees communities of color disproportionately impacted by air pollution, water pollution, and toxic chemicals. All people in the United States should be able to easily access public services, and all citizens should be able to exercise their Constitutional right to vote without facing unjust or discriminatory barriers. Democrats will restore the full powers of the Voting Rights Act and go further to roll back discriminatory policies that have been put in place in recent years to prevent people of color from voting. We will ensure all federal agencies produce materials in languages commonly spoken in the United States, including languages spoken by Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, and that voting materials are also easily accessible for citizens with limited English proficiency. Protecting Women’s Rights Democrats will fight to guarantee equal rights for women, including by ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment and at long last enshrining gender equality in the U.S. Constitution. We will take aggressive action to end pay inequality, including by increasing penalties against companies that discriminate against women and passing the Paycheck Fairness Act. Democrats are committed to ending sexual assault, domestic abuse, and other violence against women, including the epidemics of violence against Native American women and transgender women of color. Like the majority of Americans, Democrats believe every woman should be able to access high-quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion. We oppose and will fight to overturn federal and state laws that create barriers to women’s reproductive health and rights, including by repealing the Hyde Amendment and protecting and codifying the right to reproductive freedom. And Democrats will take action to protect the rights of pregnant women in the workplace, including by requiring employers to make reasonable accommodations for pregnant and breastfeeding workers and those who have recently given birth and at last joining other advanced economies by enacting paid sick days and universal paid family and medical leave. Protecting LGBTQ+ Rights Democrats applaud this year’s U.S. Supreme Court decision that made clear that employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity violates the law, but we know we still have work to do to ensure LGBTQ+ people are treated equally under the law and in our society. We will fight to enact the Equality Act and at last outlaw discrimination against LGBTQ+ people in housing, public accommodations, access to credit, education, jury service, and federal programs. We will work to ensure LGBTQ+ people are not discriminated against when seeking to adopt or foster children, protect LGBTQ+ children from bullying and assault, and guarantee transgender students’ access to facilities based on their gender identity. Democrats will ensure federally funded programs for older adults are inclusive for LGBTQ+ seniors. Recognizing that LGBTQ+ youth and adults suffer from significant health disparities, including mental health and substance use disorders, Democrats will expand mental health and suicide prevention services, and ban harmful “conversion therapy” practices. We will ensure that all transgender and non-binary people can procure official government identification documents that accurately reflect their gender identity. We will stop employment discrimination in the federal government, and will restore full implementation of President Obama’s executive order prohibiting discrimination by federal contractors on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Democrats are committed to ending the homelessness crisis, including among LGBTQ+ youth. We will fight to end violence against transgender Americans and particularly against Black transgender women, who are disproportionately victims of assault and homicide , and will prioritize the investigation of hate crimes against transgender and non-binary people. Protecting Disability Rights One in four American adults live with a disability. Democrats believe people with disabilities deserve to lead full, happy, and healthy lives. Democrats will fully enforce the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, and the Help America Vote Act, among other bedrock statutes protecting the rights of people with disabilities. We will oppose any efforts to weaken enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act. We will ensure non-discrimination in access to health care, building on the protections for people with disabilities enshrined in the Affordable Care Act. We will ensure every federal agency aggressively enforces the integration mandate affirmed in the Olmstead decision, and repair the damage done by the Trump Administration. We will rigorously enforce non-discrimination protections for people with disabilities in health care, employment, education, and housing, and ensure equal access to the ballot box. Democrats are committed to supporting the millions of Americans on the autism spectrum and their families. We will expand early childhood screening, particularly in underserved communities, and promote equitable treatment of students on the autism spectrum in schools and educational settings, in keeping with our commitment to providing equal educational opportunities for students with disabilities. By eliminating state waiting lists for home and community-based care, ending the institutional bias in Medicaid, and expanding support for informal caregivers, Democrats will enable more individuals with autism to receive the support they need in their homes and communities. Democrats will phase out the subminimum wage, expand competitive, integrated employment opportunities, and protect and strengthen economic security for people with disabilities. We will take a holistic approach to the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) programs that are essential for millions of Americans with disabilities by increasing SSI benefits, eliminating waiting periods for SSDI, and eliminating the “benefit cliff” for SSDI benefits. We will increase federal funding to expand accessible transportation and accessible, integrated, and affordable housing. We will protect people with disabilities in emergencies and meet the needs of travelers with disabilities. We will ensure new technologies benefit, and are affordable and accessible for, people with disabilities. We will expand access to tax-advantaged ABLE savings accounts, which provide people with disabilities a way to pay for disability-related expenses like housing, education, and transportation. And Democrats will improve access to home- and community-based care for people with disabilities and older Americans, including by enforcing the Medicaid Home and Community-Based Settings Rule, ending the institutional bias within Medicaid, and expanding the home care workforce to end state waiting lists for long-term services and supports. Honoring Indigenous Tribal Nations The U.S. government has a profound legal and moral obligation toward Native American Tribes and Indigenous communities— a trust which has been broken time and again, undermining Tribal nations’ ability to flourish politically, culturally, and economically. Democrats are committed to honoring, upholding, and strengthening the United States’ trust obligations to Tribal Nations and communities, as enshrined in the Constitution, treaties, federal statutes, and case law. Democrats recognize and support the sovereignty of Tribal Nations and pledge to work on a nation-to-nation basis to empower Indigenous peoples, increase economic development in Tribal Nations, and protect Tribal lands, assets, resources, and treaty rights. We honor and support the great Indigenous traditions all across the country. We stand with the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe and all Tribal Nations in rejecting the Trump Administration’s efforts to remove land that had been put into trust by the Obama-Biden Administration. We will fight to enact a clean Carcieri fix and support policies to restore Tribal lands, including culturally significant federal lands, by moving land into trust, streamlining the land-into-trust process, and conducting land buy-backs. We will also support establishment of additional federal co-management agreements with Tribal Nations on federal lands that have cultural and historical significance to Tribes. Democrats believe the federal government must commit to providing full funding to fulfill unmet trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations and Native American peoples. We will work on a nation-to-nation basis to increase funding, resources, and financial tools for Tribes, particularly in the key areas of criminal justice, health care, education, housing, and economic development. Democrats will work to address the predictability of funding for Tribes, and explore pathways including mandatory funding, advanced appropriations, shutdown exemptions, and other mechanisms. The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated Indian Country, with some Tribal communities facing among the highest per capita infection rates in the country. As part of our commitment to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, Democrats will support funding to hire sufficient staff to conduct contact tracing for all who test positive for this deadly disease. We will surge funding to the Indian Health Service and support investments to help Tribal governments address the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic and President Trump’s recession, including investments to support and create jobs in Tribal communities and to support affordable child care, so parents are not forced to choose between keeping their jobs and keeping their children safe. Democrats recognize the security of Native peoples (American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians) is paramount, and will ensure that they have the resources they need to investigate and prosecute crimes against Native peoples and communities, including cooperation from law enforcement agencies outside Tribal lands. We will fight for justice for missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. Democrats will at last reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, reaffirm provisions relating to Tribal jurisdiction, and expand the list of crimes that can be prosecuted under the statute to include stalking, child abuse, and trafficking. We also support Indian Tribal jurisdiction over Tribal lands, and we support further efforts to address the Oliphant decision. We will defend the Indian Child Welfare Act and protect Native families and involve Tribes in child welfare cases. And we will build on federal programs to reduce the disproportionate incarceration of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian men and women, reduce sentencing disparities, and work to ensure all returning citizens have access to housing, employment services, and health care, including mental health and substance use disorder treatment. American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians are uninsured at higher rates and suffer from disparities in health outcomes, including in the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats will make mandatory and work toward full funding for the Indian Health Service and the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act to help expand access to health care for Native people, including mental health, dental care, and substance use disorder treatments, and will fully fund contract support costs. We will expand insurance coverage for Native Americans (including American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians) no matter where they live by creating a high-quality, affordable public option on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, and making the public option available without premiums to low-income families. The legacy of Native American boarding schools has caused generational trauma. We acknowledge this injustice and support continued education and restorative justice. We will invest in Indian education from early childhood through college and career education. Democrats will significantly expand funding for the Bureau of Indian Education and invest in improving public school buildings. We will increase resources for programs that promote cultural preservation and enable Native students to learn their Indigenous languages, and support national curricula to teach Native American history and culture in schools. Democrats will increase recruitment of high-quality teachers and school professionals in Tribal areas. And we will break down barriers that keep Native American students from accessing a college education, including by making community colleges free and significantly increasing support to lower attendance costs at Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs). Democrats are committed to reestablishing and strengthening the White House Generation Indigenous initiative and its annual White House Tribal Youth Gathering to support Native youth. We are committed to combating hurtful and racist Native American stereotypes in mainstream American culture, especially those associated with sports teams and educational institutions. Democrats will substantially increase investments to meet Tribal housing needs, including by constructing and upgrading affordable housing on Tribal lands, investing in drinking and clean water infrastructure, and investing in rural and Tribal broadband infrastructure. We will make energy-saving upgrades to millions of low-income homes and affordable and public housing units, and increase funding for the Indian Community Development Block Grant program. We will unlock significant new resources for economic development on Tribal lands, including supporting investments in clean energy, climate change resilience, and 21st century infrastructure projects. We will expand access to capital for Tribes by increasing resources for the Native American CDFI Assistance Program, expanding and making permanent the New Markets Tax Credit, and expanding technical assistance to enable Tribes to better access existing federal funding streams. We will continue to support and expand SBA programs for Tribes and fully implement the Buy Indian Act. We will also support Tribal governments and their authority to tax activities on their lands in support of Tribal self-sufficiency and government services. Democrats are committed to environmental justice for Indian Country, and will work to ensure all people have clean air, clean water, modern wastewater infrastructure, and can live without exposure to toxic chemicals. Democrats recognize that the Native American men and women who have proudly served in the Armed Forces of the United States in all its wars, from the beginning of U.S. history, deserve the total and unqualified support of their needs by the federal government. We will ensure that all the benefits provided to U.S. military veterans are provided to Native veterans and fully funded to meet the special cultural needs of Native veterans. Democrats will additionally establish a Veterans Affairs Tribal Advisory Committee to foster improved collaboration and coordination between the federal government and Tribal Nations on meeting the unique needs of Native American veterans, and establish Tribal veteran service delivery programs in Tribal communities. Democrats commit to managing federal actions and undertakings in a manner that honors the trust responsibility; respects the nation-to-nation relationship and sovereignty of Tribes; and protects subsistence, treaty, and other reserved rights, natural and cultural resources, and sacred sites of federally-recognized Indian Tribes. We commit to upholding leasing and rights-of-way regulations that strengthen Tribal sovereignty and ensure Tribal consent on lands in which Tribes hold an interest. We will create a more robust and meaningful consultation process that is consistent across all federal agencies, including the Office of Management and Budget, and use early and ongoing consultation to identify and work to appropriately mitigate or address concerns. Democrats recognize that self-governance and self-determination empowers Tribes to prioritize their needs and plan for the future consistent with their distinct traditions, economies, and institutions. Recognizing the success many Tribes have had with self-governance, we will work to make it more effective within the Bureau of Indian Affairs and encourage other federal agencies to negotiate such agreements with Tribes. Consistent with the policies of the Obama-Biden Administration, Democrats will make permanent the White House Council on Native American Affairs and commit to holding an annual White House Tribal Nations Conference. We will nominate federal judges who understand Indian law, and will ensure Native Americans and Alaska Natives are appointed to high-level and leadership positions within the federal government. Over 70 percent of Native Americans live off-reservation. Democrats will create a strategy to support urban Indian populations and ensure their voices are heard and no one is left behind, including by expanding support to access quality health care, culturally relevant education, affordable housing, and other programs. 46 Democrats also support efforts for self-governance and self-determination of Native Hawaiians. Native Hawaiians are the Indigenous, aboriginal people of Hawai’i whose values and culture are the foundation of the Hawaiian Islands. We support proactive actions by the federal government to enhance Native Hawaiian culture, housing, health, language, and education. We recognize and honor the contributions and sacrifices made in service to our country by Native Hawaiians. Ending Violence Against Women Democrats are committed to ending sexual assault, domestic abuse, and other violence against women. We will act swiftly to overcome Republican obstructionism and reauthorize and expand the Violence Against Women Act to better protect Native American women, women with disabilities, children and young women, transgender women and other LGBTQ+ people, and other groups who are disproportionately affected by sexual assault and domestic abuse. Democrats will expand services for survivors of violence against women, including by expanding access to housing, legal assistance, and victim advocate services. We will support danger assessment and lethality training for law enforcement officers and community partners to help curb domestic violence homicides. We recognize that sex workers, who are disproportionately women of color and transgender women, face especially high rates of sexual assault and violence, and we will work with states and localities to protect the lives of sex workers. We will enforce and provide tools and resources for schools to implement Title IX, which requires schools and institutions of higher education to properly investigate sexual misconduct, including peer-on-peer sexual harassment and violence; take appropriate action; and prevent future sexual misconduct. Democrats will increase resources to eliminate the national backlog of untested rape kits so that more survivors can see justice be served. And we will support federal and state legislative efforts to make “revenge porn” and other unauthorized disclosures of intimate images a civil and criminal offense. Ending the Epidemic of Gun Violence Gun violence is a public health crisis in the United States. Over 100,000 people are shot and nearly 40,000 people die annually from guns—devastating countless families, friends, and communities. We can and will make gun violence a thing of the past. Addressing the gun violence crisis requires supporting evidence-based programs that prevent gun deaths from occurring in the first place, including by making mental health care more accessible and supporting suicide reduction initiatives, funding interventions to reduce homicides and gun violence in neighborhoods, and strengthening protections against domestic violence. Democrats will also ensure the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have sufficient resources to study gun violence as a public health issue, including the ongoing health care, mental health, economic, and social costs that can affect survivors and their families for years. Democrats will enact universal background checks, end online sales of guns and ammunition, close dangerous loopholes that currently allow stalkers, abusive partners, and some individuals convicted of assault or battery to buy and possess firearms, and adequately fund the federal background check system. We will close the “Charleston loophole” and prevent individuals who have been convicted of hate crimes from possessing firearms. Democrats will ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high capacity magazines. We will incentivize states to enact licensing requirements for owning firearms and extreme risk protection order laws that allow courts to temporarily remove guns from the possession of those who are a danger to themselves or others. We will pass legislation requiring that guns be safely stored in homes. And Democrats believe that gun companies should be held responsible for their products, just like any other business, and will prioritize repealing the law that shields gun manufacturers from civil liability. Supporting Faith and Service Religious freedom is a core American value and a core value of the Democratic Party. Democrats will protect the rights of each American for the free exercise of his or her own religion. It will be the policy of the Democratic Administration to advocate for religious freedom throughout the world. Democrats celebrate America’s history of religious pluralism and tolerance, and recognize the countless acts of service of our faith communities, as well as the paramount importance of maintaining the separation between church and state enshrined in our Constitution. During the Trump Administration, too many of our religious communities have been victimized by acts of intolerance, bigotry, and violence. We will reject the Trump Administration’s use of broad religious exemptions to allow businesses, medical providers, social service agencies, and others to discriminate. Democrats will increase funding and support for security investments and protection at houses of worship, because everyone should be able to pray without fear. We will confront white nationalist terrorism and combat hate crimes perpetrated against religious minorities. Democrats also recognize that, to fully confront the legacy of systemic and structural racism, it is time to examine, confront and dismantle the government programs, policies and practices that have unfairly targeted American Muslims as security threats. We condemn the decades-long campaign to demonize and dehumanize the Muslim faith community, which has led to increased rates of violence and discrimination targeting American Muslims or those perceived to be Muslim. We will hold accountable those who engage in or enable violent or other illegal activity targeting religious minorities, including by directing the federal government to address the growing and violent threat of white supremacist, neo-Nazi and anti-government groups. Supporting Press Freedom The free press is essential to our free democracy. Democrats roundly reject President Trump’s denigration of the free and independent press, which has endangered reporters’ lives, helped fuel conspiracy theories, and deepened distrust between Americans and their government. Democrats will appoint an independent media professional to head the U.S. Agency for Global Media, to ensure that the news and information projected around the world by the federal government meets the highest standards of fact-based and unbiased journalism. Democrats are concerned about the potentially harmful effects of corporate consolidation in the media industry, including in television, radio, and newspapers, and will reinstate and strengthen media ownership rules and direct federal antitrust agencies to investigate the economic impacts of mergers in the media industry. Supporting the Arts and Culture The arts are essential to our free and democratic society, to our culture, and to our local economies. Democrats are proud of our support for arts funding and education, and will continue policies and programs that promote the creative arts. We support public funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and for art and music education in public schools. We recognize that federal grants supporting nonprofit cultural organizations, artists, scholars, and state and local governments help increase participation in the arts, enhance appreciation, and strengthen our nation's cultural heritage. We value the arts and art education for developing imagination, creativity, innovation, and critical thinking skills in students and for building bridges between people and communities across the country and around the world. COMBATING THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND PURSUING ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE Climate change is a global emergency. We have no time to waste in taking action to protect Americans’ lives and futures. The last four years have seen record-breaking storms, devastating wildfires, and historic floods. Urban and rural communities alike have suffered tens of billions of dollars in economic losses. Dams have failed catastrophically in Michigan. Farmers’ crops have been drowned in their fields across the Midwest. Coastal communities from Florida to New Jersey are facing an existential crisis as a result of sea level rise and stronger storms. Thousands of Americans have died. And President Trump still callously and willfully denies the science that explains why so many are suffering. Like so many crises facing the United States, the impacts of climate change are not evenly distributed in our society or our economy. Communities of color, low-income families, and Indigenous communities have long suffered disproportionate and cumulative harm from air pollution, water pollution, and toxic sites. From Flint, Michigan, to the Navajo Nation, to Lowndes County, Alabama, millions of Americans have been denied access to clean, safe drinking water and even the most basic wastewater infrastructure. Pacific Islanders in Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are losing their traditional way of life as sea level rise submerges their homelands. And although the youngest generations of Americans have contributed the least to this calamity, they stand to lose the most as they suffer from the impacts of runaway carbon pollution for decades to come. Democrats believe there is a better way. We can and must build a thriving, equitable, and globally competitive clean energy economy that puts workers and communities first and leaves no one behind. We will help rebuild our economy from the COVID-19 pandemic and President Trump’s recession by mobilizing historic, transformative public and private investments to launch a clean energy revolution. We applaud the organizing efforts of young people, union workers, and communities of color to mobilize voters and make the climate crisis a top priority. As Democrats, we believe the scientists: the window for unprecedented and necessary action is closing, and closing fast. Democrats reject the false choice between growing our economy and combating climate change; we can and must do both at the same time. We will use federal resources and authorities across all agencies to deploy proven clean energy solutions; create millions of family-supporting and union jobs; upgrade and make resilient our energy, water, wastewater, and transportation infrastructure; and develop and manufacture next-generation technologies to address the climate crisis right here in the United States. And we will do all this with an eye to equity, access, benefits, and ownership opportunities for frontline communities— because Democrats believe we must embed environmental justice, economic justice, and climate justice at the heart of our policy and governing agenda. We will take immediate action to reverse the Trump Administration’s dangerous and destructive rollbacks of critical climate and environmental protections. We will rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement and, on day one, seek higher ambition from nations around the world, putting the United States back in the position of global leadership where we belong. We will restore protections for irreplaceable public lands and waters, from Bears Ears National Monument to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We will follow science and the law by reducing harmful methane and carbon pollution from the energy sector. Democrats will make investments to create millions of family-supporting and union jobs in clean energy generation, energy efficiency, clean transportation, advanced manufacturing, and sustainable agriculture across America. All jobs in the clean energy economy should provide an opportunity to join a union. Democrats will restore and protect workers’ rights to organize and bargain collectively. The clean energy economy must represent the diversity of America. We will invest in the education and training of underrepresented groups, including people of color, low-income Americans, women, veterans, people with disabilities, and unemployed energy workers for jobs in clean energy-related industries, especially union jobs that provide strong opportunities for economic advancement. Democrats will target relevant investments with the goal of delivering 40 percent of the overall benefits to disadvantaged and frontline communities, including in clean energy and energy efficiency; clean transit and transportation; affordable and sustainable housing; remediation and reduction of legacy pollution; and critical clean water infrastructure. Democrats will also mobilize a diverse new generation of young workers through a corps and cohort challenged to conserve our public lands; deliver new clean energy, including to low-income communities and communities of color; and address the changing climate, including through pre-apprenticeship opportunities, joint labor-management registered apprenticeships for training, and direct-hire programs that put good-paying and union jobs within reach for more Americans. Black, Latino, and immigrant workers are often on the front lines of disaster relief work with limited worker protections. Democrats will invest in this critical workforce, supporting the creation of family-supporting and union jobs in disaster response and climate resilience, with strong labor standards and worker protections, including good wages, benefits, access to paid leave, training and advancement opportunities. We agree with scientists and public health experts that the United States—and the world—must achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, and no later than 2050. To reach net-zero emissions as rapidly as possible, Democrats commit to eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035 through technology-neutral standards for clean energy and energy efficiency. We will dramatically expand solar and wind energy deployment through community-based and utility-scale systems, including in rural areas. Within five years, we will install 500 million solar panels, including eight million solar roofs and community solar energy systems, and 60,000 wind turbines, and turn American ingenuity into American jobs by leveraging federal policy to manufacture renewable energy solutions in America. Recognizing the urgent need to decarbonize the power sector, our technology-neutral approach is inclusive of all zero-carbon technologies, including hydroelectric power, geothermal, existing and advanced nuclear, and carbon capture and storage. Democrats believe that any clean energy infrastructure project financed with federal support, including through the tax code, should come with robust wage and labor requirements. We will build a modern electric grid by investing in interstate transmission projects and advanced, 21st century grid technologies to power communities with clean electricity, including federal support to build sustainable and resilient energy grids in rural America and in Tribal areas lacking energy infrastructure. We will reduce methane pollution through strong federal standards and targeted support for repairing and replacing aging distribution systems, which will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, including for the same pipefitters, insulators, and other workers who built the systems in the first place and who know best how to protect our communities from methane pollution. Democrats will lower families’ energy bills by making energy-saving upgrades to up to two million low-income households and affordable and public housing units within five years, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs and promoting safe, healthy, and efficient homes. We will ensure investments in affordable housing and public housing support both energy efficiency retrofits and construction of new units, to greatly increase the number of energy-efficient homes available to low-income families. We will address barriers and increase funding for programs that enable energy efficiency improvements for low-income families in urban and rural areas, including through the Weatherization Assistance Program and the Rural Utilities Service, and incentivize landlords to make energy efficiency and clean energy upgrades that will reduce their tenants’ energy costs. We will set a bold, national goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for all new buildings by 2030, on the pathway to creating a 100 percent clean building sector. Within five years, we will incentivize tens of billions of dollars in private-sector investment to retrofit four million buildings, including helping local governments save money and cut pollution by weatherizing and upgrading energy systems in hospitals, schools, public housing, and municipal buildings. Democrats will encourage states and cities to adopt energy-efficient building codes, address barriers to energy efficiency upgrades, incentivize the adoption of efficient electric and geothermal pump home heating solutions that can help reduce families’ energy burden, and leverage the federal footprint to model net-zero and 100 percent clean energy building solutions. Democrats affirm California’s statutory authority under the Clean Air Act to set its own emissions standards for cars and trucks. We will immediately convene California and other states with labor, auto industry, and environmental leaders to inform ambitious executive actions that will enable the United States to lead the way in building a clean, 21st century transportation system and stronger domestic manufacturing base for electric vehicles powered by high-wage and union jobs. Democrats will move quickly to reestablish strong standards for clean cars and trucks that consider the most recent advances in technology, and accelerate the adoption of zero-emission vehicles in the United States while reclaiming market share for domestically produced vehicles. We will reduce harmful air pollution and protect our children’s health by transitioning the entire fleet of 500,000 school buses to American-made, zero-emission alternatives within five years. We will lead by example in the public sector by transitioning the three million vehicles in the federal, state, and local fleets to zero-emission vehicles. Democrats will additionally support private adoption of affordable low-pollution and zero-emission vehicles by partnering with state and local governments to install at least 500,000 public charging stations from coast to coast. We will increase investments in public transportation, understanding that the United States currently lags behind many other developed countries in the quality and availability of efficient and accessible public transportation. Democrats will aim to provide all Americans in municipalities with 100,000 or more residents with quality public transportation options by making flexible federal investments to upgrade and expand light rail, bus lines, existing transit systems, and pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure. Democrats will invest in modernizing our freight infrastructure, including ports, rail, and maritime freight, in order to reduce air and water pollution, improve public health, create jobs, and improve economic competitiveness. Democrats believe we can build the clean energy infrastructure of the future using American-made materials. We will support measures to build a clean, equitable, and globally competitive manufacturing sector, including national Buy Clean and Buy America standards to incentivize production of low-carbon building and construction materials, like steel, cement, and timber, here in the United States. We will apply a carbon adjustment fee at the border to products from countries that fail to live up to their commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement, because we won’t let polluters undermine American competitiveness. Democrats will partner with farmers to make the American agriculture sector the first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions, opening up new sources of income for farmers in the process. We will substantially improve water security and ecological health through conservation, protection, and maintenance of our water infrastructure, including water systems for home, commercial, industrial, and agricultural use. We will expand federal programs to help farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners pursue high-productivity, lower-emission, and regenerative agricultural practices in order to help build more resilient, vibrant, local and regional food systems. We will substantially increase investments in voluntary conservation programs, which generate economic and environmental benefits for farmers and their surrounding communities. We will support healthy coastal communities and marine ecosystems to sustain and enhance our economic well-being, including in the fishing, tourism and clean energy industries. And we will support communities and businesses nationwide in their efforts to build zero-waste and circular economies, including efforts to eliminate plastic waste and food waste. Every American has the right to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and live without fear of exposure to toxic waste. And all Americans should benefit from the clean energy economy—especially those who have been left out and left behind for generations. Democrats will create an environmental justice fund to make historic investments aimed at eliminating legacy pollution, which disproportionately causes illness and premature death in communities of color, low-income communities, and Indigenous communities. We will protect children’s health by replacing lead service lines and remediating lead paint in homes and schools; remediate Superfund and other contaminated sites; and ensure housing and schools have adequate plumbing and safe wastewater disposal systems. Democrats oppose the Trump Administration's reckless and scientifically unsound decision to reverse a proposed ban on chlorpyrifos, a potent neurotoxin proven harmful to children and farmworkers. We will invest to help farmers reduce pesticide and chemical fertilizer use. And we will set science-based drinking water standards for emerging contaminants like PFOA and PFAS chemicals and establish aggressive plans for remediating this dangerous pollution. Energy companies should be held responsible for meeting strong standards to protect worker safety, public health, and the environment. Democrats are committed to ensuring tough safeguards in place, including Safe Drinking Water Act provisions, to protect local water supplies. We believe states should not be able to preempt local government decisions about energy production. Democrats will work with affected frontline communities to develop a screening and mapping tool to ensure racial and socioeconomic equity in federal climate, energy, and infrastructure programs and identify areas of high cumulative pollution that threatens residents’ health and safety. We will help reduce heat stress in urban neighborhoods by planting millions of trees. We will support locally-driven economic development a nd commit to directing a significant portion of clean energy and sustainable infrastructure investments to historically marginalized communities to help create local jobs and reduce energy poverty, install clean energy technologies including community solar, build resilience to climate change impacts, prepare for disasters, expand access to green space and outdoor recreation opportunities, improve public health, and restore ecosystems. Already, the impacts of climate change are being felt in communities across the country, and the American people are paying the price. Democrats commit to reducing climate risks and building back better after disasters and climate-fueled catastrophes in a resilient, green, and just manner. We will empower local communities to become more resilient to the impacts of the climate crisis. We will prioritize disaster preparedness for disproportionately exposed, frontline, and vulnerable communities and those who struggle most to cope, including seniors, low-income families, and people with disabilities, so that they can become more economically resilient to extreme weather events, heat stress, and increases in disease that scientists have connected to climate change. We will rectify the inequities and inefficiencies of disaster response, including transparent and timely reporting and oversight and protections and enforcement of disability rights. Democrats will ensure FEMA has the experienced leadership, staff, and resources necessary to coordinate the federal response to climate change-influenced and other disasters, and is equipped to work in partnership with, and drive federal resources to, state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments to mount a successful emergency response in conjunction with local emergency responders, help communities recover and rebuild, and invest in pre-disaster mitigation and resilience. We will increase support for restoring wetlands, which are critical for protecting communities from sea level rise and storm surge and also act as natural carbon sinks. We will partner with states and local communities to make smart investments to avoid the loss of life and property, prevent flooding, mitigate disaster risks, and adapt to costly, growing climate impacts. Democrats recognize that climate change poses serious risks to the economy and the financial system. We will require public companies to disclose climate risks and greenhouse gas emissions in their operations and supply chains. We will hold polluters and corporate executives accountable for intentionally hiding or distorting material information and for affecting the health and safety of workers and communities. Democrats will empower and stand with workers and communities who have put their health and lives on the line and who have been impacted by the changing energy market, including by fighting to protect retirees’ health and pension benefits, shoring up the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, expanding the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act to include those harmed by our nation’s nuclear weapons efforts including uranium miners exposed to radiation on the job, and increasing funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission to support locally-driven economic development priorities. We will hold fossil fuel companies accountable for cleaning up abandoned mine lands, oil and gas wells, and industrial sites, so these facilities no longer pollute local environments and can be safely repurposed to support new economic activity, including in the heart of coal country. Democrats will support the most historically far reaching public investments and private sector incentives for research, development, demonstration, and deployment of next-generation technologies, once again making the United States the world’s leader in innovation. We will challenge the best and brightest scientists, innovators, and entrepreneurs in the world to pursue breakthrough opportunities in energy storage, heavy-duty trucking and freight solutions, sustainable aviation fuels, and direct air capture and net-negative emissions technologies. We will advance innovative technologies that create cost-effective pathways for industries to decarbonize, including carbon capture and sequestration that permanently stores greenhouse gases and advanced nuclear that eliminates waste associated with conventional nuclear technology, while ensuring environmental justice and other overburdened communities are protected from increases in cumulative pollution. All of these investments will create jobs for blue-collar workers, including in fenceline communities, help decarbonize American industries, and create valuable new exports to help mitigate climate change around the world. America’s national parks and monuments, public lands, and marine protected areas are treasures that should be held in trust for future generations. We will protect these precious places and preserve America’s unspoiled wildernesses for hunting, fishing, hiking, and camping by codifying the roadless rule, and grow America’s outdoor recreation economy, which supports millions of jobs in rural areas. Democrats will immediately reverse the Trump Administration’s harmful rollbacks of protections for national monuments like Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument. We support banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters, modifying royalties to account for climate costs, and establishing targeted programs to enhance reforestation and develop renewables on federal lands and waters. We will take action to protect wildernesses and waters, and require full, rigorous, and transparent scientific and environmental reviews of any proposed mining projects near national treasures. Democrats will protect wildlife habitats and biodiversity, slow extinction rates, and grow America’s natural carbon sinks by conserving 30 percent of our lands and waters by 2030. We support fully funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund to increase resources for conserving public lands and waters and incentivizing voluntary conservation efforts on private lands, including through private-sector ecosystems markets. And Democrats will ensure America’s public lands and waters reflect the diversity of our country by engaging all Americans in the great outdoors, building a diverse workforce in our land management agencies, and protecting landscapes, marinescapes, and cultural sites that tell the full story of America. RESTORING AND STRENGTHENING OUR DEMOCRACY Our government and our elections are supposed to reflect the interests of the American people, not only the wealthiest few and the biggest corporations. Democrats will fight to restore and protect Americans’ fundamental right to vote, including by aggressively pushing back against Republican governors, legislatures, and state officials who have disenfranchised people of color, young people, low-income people, and people with disabilities. And we will strictly enforce ethics laws and improve transparency across the federal government in order to rebuild trust with the American people, and will protect civil servants and whistleblowers from political retribution. Protecting and Enforcing Voting Rights Democrats are committed to the sacred principle of “one person, one vote” —and we will fight to achieve that principle for every citizen, regardless of race, income, disability status, geography, or English language proficiency. We stand united against the determined Republican campaign to disenfranchise voters through onerous voter ID laws, unconstitutional and excessive purges of the voter rolls, and closures of polling places in low-income neighborhoods, on college campuses, and in communities of color. Americans should never have to wait in hours-long lines to exercise their voting rights. Democrats will strengthen our democracy by guaranteeing that every American’s vote is protected. We will make it a priority to pass legislation that restores and strengthens the Voting Rights Act, and ensure the Department of Justice challenges state laws that make it harder for Americans to vote. We will make voting easier and more accessible for all Americans by supporting automatic voter registration, same-day voter registration, early voting, and universal vote-from-home and vote-by-mail options. Democrats believe Election Day should be a national holiday, in celebration of our democratic institutions and to make it easier for everyone to cast their ballot. Democrats recognize that unions, community groups, faith organizations and other civic organizations are critical to facilitating registration, encouraging voting, and protecting voter rights. We will fully implement the Help America Vote Act and require that polling places and elections are accessible for people with disabilities, and work to ensure that returning citizens have their voting rights restored upon release from jail or prison without the additional hurdle of having to pay fines and fees in order to vote. Democrats will also fight for emergency funding for states to help make vote-from-home and vote-by-mail universally available during the pandemic, while ensuring that all jurisdictions take steps to ensure continued meaningful, safe opportunities to vote in person. We recognize that the United States Postal Service is more than ever a critical component to our democracy and must be supported to guarantee timely and efficient delivery and return of vote by mail ballots. Election officials must be provided with sufficient time after election day to process, count, and audit all ballots. We must give voters the confidence that their ballot was counted as cast by supporting mandatory, statistically meaningful post-election audits and full transparency of all election results and data. To ensure every eligible ballot is counted, vote by mail voters must be informed of and provided a meaningful opportunity to fix any problem with their ballot. A professional and well-trained election workforce is critical to the administration of elections, we support ongoing federal and state funding for local elections offices. Gerrymandering distorts our democracy, and Democrats will enact measures to end partisan gerrymandering in federal elections. Efforts to redraw legislative districts following the 2020 Census must be guided by transparency and public input, while reducing the power of partisan actors, so that maps reflect the will of voters, fairly represent communities of color, and provide for competitive races. We will protect the integrity of the decennial Census from political interference, including ensuring that apportionment and redistricting be based on total population counts, and also ensure the Census Bureau is equipped to conduct cost-effective, timely, and accurate surveys. Democrats will maintain the legal requirement for Census participation and increase resources to reduce undercounts of communities of color, immigrants, LGBTQ+ people, people with disabilities, rural and low-income populations, and young children that have long plagued the decennial Census. We will also direct the Census Bureau to study whether counting the prison population where they are incarcerated creates inequitable outcomes in state or federal representation or funding allocations. Democrats will increase investments to help state and local governments upgrade election technology, including cybersecurity technology, and ensure that election technology is accessible for people with disabilities. Democrats will also increase oversight of private election vendors to ensure voting systems are secure and worthy of voters' trust. We will not tolerate election interference and will protect the integrity of our elections from all enemies, foreign and domestic. Reforming the Broken Campaign Finance System Democrats believe that the interests and the voices of the American people should determine our elections. Money is not speech, and corporations are not people. Democrats will fight to pass a Constitutional amendment that will go beyond merely overturning Citizens United and related decisions like Buckley v. Valeo by eliminating all private financing from federal elections. In the meantime, Democrats will work with Congress on legislation to strengthen the public funding system by matching small-dollar donations for all federal candidates, crack down on foreign nationals who try to influence elections, and ensure that super PACs are wholly independent of campaigns and political parties. We will bring an end to “dark money” by requiring full disclosure of contributors to any group that advocates for or against candidates, and bar 501(c)(4) organizations from spending money on elections. Democrats will ban corporate PACs from donating to candidates and bar lobbyists from donating, fundraising, or bundling for anyone they lobby. Building an Effective, Transparent Federal Government Every federal employee swears an oath to support and defend the Constitution. It is a sacred promise to the American people—that federal workers, both civil servants and political appointees, will put the interests of the many ahead of their own personal concerns. President Trump and his Administration have abused the trust between the American people and their government—including by denigrating civil servants, directing federal grants and contracts toward their cronies and political donors, inappropriately interfering with federal investigations and firing independent watchdogs, retaliating against whistleblowers, failing to share information as required with Congress, and, most nefariously, violating the law by withholding congressionally appropriated funds in an attempt to get a foreign government to interfere in America’s elections. Democrats will establish a commission on federal ethics to aggressively enforce and strengthen federal ethics laws, including rules around personal financial disclosures for Executive Branch officials, and make campaign finance, financial disclosure, and lobbying disclosure filings easier for the public to access and understand. We support requiring all candidates for federal office, including presidential candidates, to publicly disclose at least 10 years of tax returns. The American people deserve assurances that their elected officials and federal appointees work for them, not for special interests. Democrats will re-establish merit-based federal contracting decisions and prohibit political appointees, at the White House or in agency leadership, from interfering in grantmaking. We will restore and re-empower independent inspectors general across the federal government and work to strengthen whistleblower protections to fully protect federal employees from retaliation. And we will ban lobbying by foreign governments and significantly lower the threshold for having to register as a federal lobbyist in order to close loopholes that allow special interests to secretly influence policymaking in Congress and across the federal government. Democrats condemn President Trump's determination to sow chaos and division by inappropriately deploying federal agents to American cities, where too many have used egregious tactics against peaceful protestors. We know federal agents can ably protect federal property while also clearly displaying badges, insignias, and identifying markings; without detaining Americans in undisclosed locations without cause; and without brutally attacking peaceful protestors. Democrats are committed to following the rule of law and will uphold the First Amendment right to peaceably assemble. The Republican Party has packed our federal courts with unqualified, partisan judges who consistently rule for corporations, the wealthy, and Republican interests. They have undermined the legitimacy of our courts through an anti-democratic, win-at-all costs campaign that includes blocking a Democratic president from appointing a justice to the Supreme Court and obstructing dozens of diverse lower-court nominees. The Democratic Party recognizes the need for structural court reforms to increase transparency and accountability. Now more than ever, federal agencies need experts on staff who know how to use science, evidence, data, and facts to guide decision-making on behalf of the American people. As the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates, our country needs the best experts working within government to protect and improve the lives of all Americans. Democrats support the recruitment of people with expertise in science, social science, technology, and innovation to jobs in public service to help solve our nation’s most pressing challenges. To ensure that federal funds are invested as effectively and efficiently as possible, the federal government should be using the best available evidence when making budget and spending decisions. Democrats will ensure federal data collection and analysis is adequately funded and designed to allow for disaggregation by race, gender, LGBTQ+ status, geography, disability status, and other important variables, so that disparities can be better understood and addressed. Democrats support the widespread use of strategies to promote evidence-based policymaking, including more robust evaluations of tax expenditures and allocating funds for program evaluation, to help ensure the American people are receiving the most productive, efficient services from our federal government. Making Washington, D.C. the 51st State It’s time to stop treating the more than 700,000 people who live in our nation’s capital as second-class citizens. The residents of Washington, D.C. pay more per capita in federal income taxes than any state in the country—and more in total federal income tax than 22 states—and yet the District has zero voting representatives in the U.S. Congress. The Congress retains broad power to override budget decisions made by democratically elected officials in Washington, D.C. And as was made shockingly clear to the American people this year, under current law, Washington, D.C. does not have control over its own National Guard units and can be occupied by military forces at the President’s whim. The citizens of Washington, D.C.—a majority of whom are people of color—voted overwhelmingly in favor of statehood in a 2016 referendum and have ratified a state constitution. Democrats unequivocally support statehood for Washington, D.C., so the citizens of the District can at last have full and equal representation in Congress and the rights of self-determination. Guaranteeing Self-Determination for Puerto Rico The people of Puerto Rico deserve self-determination on the issue of status. Democrats are committed to helping the island rebuild and recover from the devastation wrought by Hurricanes Irma and Maria and the recent earthquakes, and will mobilize resources across the federal government to address the island’s disparities in energy, infrastructure, health care, education, housing, agriculture, employment, and disaster preparedness. Disaster response in Puerto Rico must be given the same priority and be conducted on the same basis as federal responses to natural disasters elsewhere in the United States. We will forgive disaster relief loans issued to Puerto Rican municipalities following Hurricanes Irma and Maria to help expedite the island’s economic recovery. The unequal treatment of Puerto Rico’s residents must end. We will invest in the island’s future through economic development initiatives, increased education funding, construction of affordable housing, and innovative energy and climate resilience programs. Democrats support accelerating access to disaster recovery funds so the island can improve its infrastructure and transform itself into one of the fastest-growing, most prosperous parts of the United States. We also believe Puerto Rico should be treated equally with respect to federal programs, including Medicaid, SNAP, and the Child Tax Credit. Bankruptcy blocks Puerto Rico’s growth and recovery. Democrats will help restructure and provide relief from Puerto Rico’s remaining debt burden and work with the government of Puerto Rico to accelerate progress in order to dissolve the Financial Oversight and Management Board. Supporting the U.S. Territories Democrats recognize and honor the contributions and sacrifices made in service of our country by the Americans living in the territories of Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The people of the U.S. territories have played a vital role in American democracy for more than 120 years, and have for too long been met with unequal treatment by the federal government. We support establishing a Congressional task force to gather findings on voting rights in the territories, and recommend changes to Congress to allow for the full and equal voting rights of U.S. citizens who are residents of the territories in federal elections, and for full and equal voting representation in the U.S. House of Representatives. The American citizens of the U.S. territories should have the right to vote for President of the United States. Democrats will support self-determination for the people of the U.S territories, including respecting their right to decide their future status in a fair, binding, and equitable manner. The U.S. Virgin Islands suffered significant impacts as a result of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and American Samoa have suffered damages as a result of intensifying Pacific typhoons and cyclones. Democrats will support investments to help the U.S. territories recover from recent natural disasters and build increased resilience to the impacts of climate change, including by expanding access to clean, affordable, reliable energy and water systems. We will mobilize resources to address disparities in agriculture, economic development, education, employment, energy, health care, housing, and infrastructure in the U.S. territories to help the territories diversify their economies and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. We will improve health care access and affordability and support policies to address health disparities in the U.S. territories. We believe the territories should be treated equally with respect to important federal programs, including the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, SNAP, and the Child Tax Credit, that reduce poverty and support working families. And Democrats commit to ensuring veterans from the U.S. territories have access to timely and quality health care and other benefits through the VA. Democrats will continue to work with the people of Guam to properly memorialize residents who suffered unspeakable harm as a result of their U.S. nationality during the Imperial Japanese occupation of Guam during World War II. We recognize the increasing demands placed on state and territorial governments by migration under the Compacts of Free Association (COFA), and will explore mechanisms for increasing reimbursement of costs absorbed by Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Hawaii. And Democrats will restore Medicaid eligibility for migrants under COFA who are legally residing, working, and studying in the United States, but who were inadvertently left out of health care legislation. Strengthening the U.S. Postal Service The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is the world’s most efficient mail carrier, and Democrats are wholly committed to supporting a public USPS. We will fight all efforts to privatize the USPS and will work to ensure the USPS is financially sustainable, including by repealing the mandate that the agency “pre-fund” retiree health costs. Democrats will protect the Postal Service’s universal service obligation as a core American value and maintain six-day and doorstep mail delivery, which is a lifeline for rural Americans. And we will work to restore service to appropriate levels, including overnight delivery of first-class mail and periodicals within the same metropolitan area, maintaining six-day and door-to door delivery, and appointing members to the Board of Governors and the Postal Regulatory Commission who champion a strong public Postal Service. We will also support new revenue streams for the USPS, including allowing secure shipping of alcoholic beverages by mail and exploring options to enable unbanked and underbanked Americans to access financial services through the Postal Service. CREATING A 21ST CENTURY IMMIGRATION SYSTEM Out of many, we are one. That bedrock American idea has animated our country from its earliest days, inspiring people from every corner of the earth to participate in our great democratic experiment. The Trump Administration has repudiated that idea and abandoned our values as a diverse, compassionate, and welcoming country. Instead of pursuing a sensible, humane, and responsible approach to immigration that strengthens the United States, the Trump Administration has been callous, cruel, and reckless in the extreme. President Trump’s immigration policies have made our communities less safe, undermined our economy, and tarnished our image around the world. This Administration’s cruelty and dehumanization of immigrants stretches the imagination and shocks the conscience: forcibly separating families and putting children in cages; deporting veterans who have fought to defend our freedoms; conducting militarized raids on our workplaces; endangering lives by denying COVID-19 testing and treatment based on immigration status, including to essential workers at the forefront of the pandemic response; banning people from traveling to the United States based on their faith or their country of origin; and turning away refugees and asylum seekers fleeing violence and persecution. These actions should not happen in our country again. Democrats believe America can do better. Indeed, we must. The truth is that our immigration system was broken long before President Trump came into office, and his departure alone won’t fix it. Immigrants are essential to our society and our economy. Immigrants are part of our families. They enrich our culture. They grow our food, care for our loved ones, serve in our armed forces, and provide critical health care services. Immigrants make America stronger. Not only do immigrants support us—immigrants are us. Our families and our communities, our congregations and our schools, our businesses large and small have been built and sustained through the inclusion of immigrants. That’s why Democrats commit to building a 21st century immigration system that reflects our values, repairs past harms, heals our communities, rebuilds our economy, and renews our global leadership. We will start by righting the wrongs of the Trump Administration. Democrats will rescind President Trump’s fabricated “National Emergency,” which siphons funding away from our men and women in uniform to construct an unnecessary, wasteful, and ineffective wall on the southern border. We will immediately terminate the Trump Administration’s discriminatory travel and immigration bans that disproportionately impact Muslim, Arab, and African people, and invite those whose visas have been denied under these xenophobic and un-American policies to re-apply to come to the United States. We will support legislation to ensure that no president can enact discriminatory bans ever again. We will reinstate, expand, and streamline protections for Dreamers and the parents of American citizen children to keep families together in the communities they have long called home. Democrats believe the United States should be a beacon of hope for those who are suffering violence and injustice, which is why we will protect and expand the existing asylum system and other humanitarian protections. We will reverse Trump Administration policies that prevent victims of gang and domestic violence, as well as LGBTQ+ people who are unsafe in their home countries, from being eligible to apply for asylum. Democrats will end Trump Administration policies that deny protected entry to asylum seekers, put them at great risk, and destabilize our neighbors and the broader region. And we will end prosecution of asylum seekers at the border and policies that force them to apply from “safe third countries,” which are far from safe. Democrats believe that our fight to end systemic and structural racism in our country extends to our immigration system, including the policies at our borders and ports of entry, detention centers, and within immigration law enforcement agencies and their policies and operations. And Democrats will immediately halt enforcement of and rescind the Trump Administration’s un-American immigrant wealth test. Even as we work to reverse the enormous damage caused by the Trump Administration, we are determined to build a 21st century immigration system that embodies our values, expands economic opportunity for all Americans, and enhances our global competitiveness. Democrats believe it is long past time to provide a roadmap to citizenship for the millions of undocumented workers, caregivers, students, and children who are an essential part of our economy and of the fabric of our nation. We will fast-track this process for those workers who have been essential to the pandemic response and recovery efforts, including health care workers, farmworkers, and others. We will also eliminate unfair barriers to naturalization, reduce application backlogs, and make our immigration processes faster, more efficient, and less costly. These reforms will strengthen our communities, our families, our economy, and our country. Democrats oppose President Trump’s illegal, chaotic, and reckless changes to the legal immigration system, including decisions to slash family-based immigration as well as H-1B and other visa programs that can help our economy. Democrats believe family unity should be a guiding principle for our immigration policy. We will prioritize family reunification for children still separated from their families, and we will restore family reunification programs ended by the Trump Administration. We support legislation to treat the spouses and children of green card holders as immediate relatives and end their unfair separation. We will eliminate family-based green card backlogs and reform the system to speed up family-based visas. And we will work with Congress to eliminate immigration barriers, such as the three- and 10-year bars, and remove the 10-year waiting period for waivers to the permanent bars that keep loved ones apart. We believe we should expand, not reduce, the annual visa cap for victims of human trafficking, including victims of sex trafficking, violence against women and children, and other heinous crimes; ensure that same sex-couples and their children receive equal treatment in the immigration and naturalization systems; reaffirm America’s commitment to family-based immigration; and preserve the critical role of diversity preferences in our immigration system. Democrats will ensure that law-abiding individuals with Temporary Protected Status or Deferred Enforced Departure are not sent back to countries where they cannot live safely, and we will work to pave a path to citizenship for those who have been in the country for an extended period of time and built their lives in the United States. Democrats know that when employers feel free to abuse and bully immigrant workers, all workers suffer. That’s why we will hold employers accountable, promote workers’ rights, and prioritize the enforcement of labor and employment laws across the economy, including discrimination and sexual harassment protections, wage and hour laws, and health and safety rules. We will prevent employers from taking advantage of immigrant workers by establishing an affirmative process to request deferred action for workers who report labor violations and by supporting the Domestic Workers’ Bill of Rights and the Protect Our Workers from Exploitation and Retaliation (POWER) Act. We will ensure that enforcement mechanisms are humane and consistent with our values and international humanitarian obligations. That’s why we will end workplace and community raids. We will protect sensitive locations like our schools, houses of worship, health care facilities, benefits offices, and DMVs from immigration enforcement actions, and prohibit raids in which children and members of vulnerable populations are left behind without their caregivers. We will prohibit enforcement actions that deter access to justice at courthouses and repress freedom of speech and assembly, end programs that force state and local law enforcement to also be responsible for immigration enforcement, and stop targeting men and women who served in uniform and their families. We will reaffirm enforcement officials’ ability to engage in the pre-Trump practice of prosecutorial discretion for deserving cases, including when needed to address humanitarian issues or other injustices. We will also prevent enforcement officials from retaliating against individuals for their political speech or activity, or because of their efforts to advocate for individuals’ rights. We believe detention should be a last resort, not the default. Democrats will prioritize investments in more effective and cost-efficient community-based alternatives to detention. We will end for-profit detention centers and ensure that any facility where migrants are being detained is held to the highest standards of care and guarantees their safety and dignity. We will ensure all detention centers provide access to competent interpreters who speak migrants' native languages and dialects. Detention of children should be restricted to the shortest possible time, with their access to education and proper care ensured. We will prioritize alternatives to detention for individuals with special vulnerabilities—those who are known to be suffering from serious physical or mental illness, who have disabilities, who are elderly, pregnant, or nursing, who demonstrate that they are primary caretakers of children or an infirm person, identify as gay, lesbian, transgender, gender non-conforming, or intersex, or whose detention is otherwise not in the public interest. Democrats will implement robust mechanisms for oversight, accountability, and transparency to ensure immigration agencies abide by our values, the U.S. Constitution, and international law. Democrats believe immigration judges should be able to operate free of inappropriate political influence, and will support steps to make immigration courts more independent. We will demand that leaders of our immigration agencies be Senate-confirmed professionals, and that Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection personnel abide by our values and professional, evidence-based standards and are held accountable for any inappropriate, unlawful, or inhumane treatment. A 21st century immigration system that honors our values is an essential prerequisite not just to recovering from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, but to strengthening our democracy and guaranteeing America’s long-term economic competitiveness. That’s why Democrats believe in improving and increasing opportunities for legal, permanent immigration. Our family, humanitarian, and diversity pathways have contributed immeasurably to the vibrancy and productivity of American society and should continue to be the centerpiece of our immigration system . We also support awarding visas for permanent, employment-based immigration in a way that is responsive to labor market needs. We want to attract and keep talent in this country, which is why Democrats will end the Trump Administration’s freeze on green cards for new immigrants and instead pursue a meaningful reform agenda. Democrats support policies and programs to make it easier for qualified immigrants and their families to become full and equal citizens, including increasing funding for culturally appropriate immigrant inclusion and citizenship services, legal support, English classes and bilingual education, workforce development, and adult education. Finally, Democrats will address the root causes of migration—violence and insecurity, poverty, pervasive corruption, lack of educational and economic opportunity, and the impacts of climate change. Disciplined American leadership and well-designed assistance programs can help prevent and mitigate the effects of migration crises around the world, from Southeast Asia to Sub-Saharan Africa to Central America. We will support a comprehensive strategy to strengthen security and prosperity in partnership with the people of Central America and the Caribbean and with the support of the international community. And we will renew American diplomacy as our tool of first resort, rebuild our partnerships and alliances, and once again lead the global humanitarian response. PROVIDING A WORLD-CLASS EDUCATION IN EVERY ZIP CODE Education is fundamental to the idea of America and to fulfilling our nation’s promise. It is the key to addressing the challenges before us— to growing our economy, maintaining American competitiveness on the world stage, and building a more just, equitable, civically engaged, and socially conscientious nation. As Democrats, we believe that education is a critical public good—not a commodity— and that it is the government’s responsibility to ensure that every child, everywhere, is able to receive a world-class education that enables them to lead meaningful lives, no matter their race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, religion, disability status, language status, immigration or citizenship status, household income or ZIP code. For too long, we have short-changed our children by underinvesting in our nation’s public schools and in our higher education system. Despite ample research showing that early childhood education can improve outcomes for students for decades to come, we still do not have universal, high-quality pre-K. Despite the decades-long trend that has seen more and more women entering the labor force as breadwinners, it is still far too difficult for families to secure safe and affordable child care services. Our public schools are bedrock community institutions, and yet our educators are underpaid, our classrooms are overstuffed, and our school buildings have been neglected, especially in low-income neighborhoods and communities of color. Roughly six in 10 jobs require at least some education beyond high school, and yet the ever-rising cost of college tuition and fees leaves higher education out of reach —or saddles students with a lifetime of debt. The emergency conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic have vividly demonstrated to parents, students, and educators across the country that there is no sustainable, long-term substitute for high-quality, in-classroom learning. Significant gaps in access to technology, including lack of access to high-speed broadband and connected devices, have deepened inequities in our educational system for students of color, students with disabilities, English language learners, and students in rural areas and under-resourced neighborhoods during this pandemic. We will significantly increase federal investments in rural, urban, and Tribal broadband infrastructure to close the digital divide and ensure students can access educational resources from their homes and schools now and in the future. We will need increased investments in public education to help students get back on track when public health experts determine it is safe to return to schools. Democrats believe we can and must do better for our children, our educators, and our country. We are committed to making the investments our students and teachers need to build equity and safeguard humanity in our educational system and guarantee every child can receive a great education. To this end, we support K-12 instruction in civics and climate literacy. We will support evidence-based programs and pedagogical approaches, including assessments that consider the well-being of the whole student and recognize the range of ways students can demonstrate learning. We will reimagine our education system guided by the stakeholders and qualified, first-class, well-trained, passionate educators who know these issues best: young people, educators, parents, and community leaders. Democrats fundamentally believe our education system should prepare all our students—indeed, all of us—for college, careers, lifelong learning, and to be informed, engaged citizens of our communities, our country, and our planet. Guaranteeing Universal Early Childhood Education Democrats believe that all children across the United States should have access to high-quality early childhood education programs. We will work with states to offer pre-K for all three- and four-year-olds and expand Head Start and Early Head Start. We will drive increased resources to the communities with the highest need, including those with the highest concentrations of low-income students, impoverished urban areas impacted by gentrification, and rural areas, and will strive to support holistic school readiness. We also will ensure students with disabilities and English language learners have access to and are fully included in early childhood programs. We recognize that learning starts at birth, and the exorbitant costs of safe, quality child care present a significant economic burden to families. Democrats support making child care and dependent tax credits significantly more generous and will increase funding to states to guarantee that low-income and middle class families can afford child care. We will make major investments to increase quality options for parents and increase compensation for providers. Democrats also support expanding proven programs for low-income and first-time parents, guardians, and caregivers, including home visiting, that can help connect families in need to child care, education, and child development opportunities and improve outcomes for children and parents alike. Democrats also support raising early childhood standards and providing ongoing professional development for early childhood educators, to ensure that children’s academic, social development, behavioral, and cognitive needs are being met. Democrats believe that early childhood educators, like all educators and all workers, should be paid a family-supporting wage, have access to benefits and paid leave, and be able to organize, join a union, and collectively bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions. Supporting High-Quality K-12 Schools Across America Each year, the United States spends $23 billion more on schools in predominantly white districts than in non-white districts. Using property taxes to fund public K-12 schools results in inequitable treatment for students in low-income school districts, compared to those in wealthier areas. Democrats are committed to closing the school funding gap by tripling Title I funding, which benefits schools that serve low-income students, and incentivizing states to adopt progressive funding formulas that direct resources to the schools that need it most. We will also ensure sustainable, reliable funding for rural schools, schools in impoverished urban areas impacted by gentrification, and Bureau of Indian Education schools. As the COVID-19 pandemic has made plain, our public schools are more than places where children learn—they are pillars of our neighborhoods and our society. Democrats believe that no student should ever be shamed over school lunch debt, and support expanding universal free school meal programs. We will also support wraparound health care and nutrition services, before- and after-school programs, adult education classes, and other services by significantly expanding the community school model. Students should have multiple public school pathways to be able to access the opportunities they deserve. Democrats will work to expand access to career and technical education, magnet schools for science and the arts, International Baccalaureate programs, and early college high schools to offer multiple pathways to meet the diverse needs and interests of America’s high school students. We will increase investments in high-quality science, technology, engineering, and mathematics programs in our public schools, support access to computer science for all and improve professional development opportunities for math and science teachers, including through the creation of a national science corps of outstanding STEM teachers serving as leaders in their schools and communities. Democrats believe we must prioritize STEAM education and funding for underrepresented students, including students of color, girls, and low-income students, to help remove enrollment and achievement barriers. We will equip students with the knowledge and skills to understand complex scientific issues, counter the rising tide of denialism by promoting environmental and climate literacy, and reverse the Trump Administration's cuts to the National Environmental Education Act. In addition to developing strong literacy, numeracy, and STEAM skills, our education system should develop the deep learning and life skills needed to thrive in the 21st century economy, including critical and creative thinking, leadership, and judgment and decision-making. Charter schools were originally intended to be publicly funded schools with increased flexibility in program design and operations. Democrats believe that education is a public good and should not be saddled with a private profit motive, which is why we will ban for-profit private charter businesses from receiving federal funding. And we recognize the need for more stringent guardrails to ensure charter schools are good stewards of federal education funds. We support measures to increase accountability for charter schools, including by requiring all charter schools to meet the same standards of transparency as traditional public schools, including with regard to civil rights protections, racial equity, admissions practices, disciplinary procedures, and school finances. We will call for conditioning federal funding for new, expanded charter schools or for charter school renewals on a district’s review of whether the charter will systematically underserve the neediest students. And Democrats oppose private school vouchers and other policies that divert taxpayer-funded resources away from the public school system, including the program at issue in the recent Espinoza decision. Democrats are committed to safe and supportive school climates for students and educators alike. Guns have no place in our schools. We disagree strongly with the Trump Administration’s dangerous and short-sighted suggestion that teachers should bring firearms into the classroom. Democrats also believe that all schools should have adequate resources to expand school-based health services and hire guidance counselors, social workers, nurses, and school psychologists to help support students’ mental health needs, address trauma, and promote social and emotional development. We will work with school administrators, educators, students, and mental health advocates to reduce the stigma that too often prevents students from seeking out these resources. Democrats will make sure schools do not engage in, and appropriately address, discrimination, bullying and harassment related to sex, including sexual orientation and gender identity; race; national origin; immigration or citizenship status; religion; disability; and language status. We will protect the rights of transgender students. It is unacceptable that America’s public schools are more racially segregated today than they were in the late 1960s. Schools—and classrooms and programs within schools—continue to be segregated by race and class. And, with increasing frequency, students are being unnecessarily and unlawfully segregated by disability, language status and through the use of exclusionary discipline and school-based arrests. We believe that schools must no longer engage in segregation and segregative practices. Democrats support appointing judges who will enforce the Civil Rights Act in schools. We will fund federal programs to promote integration and school diversity, including magnet schools and school transportation initiatives. We will also reinvigorate and increase funding for the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights, expand the civil rights data collection to inform civil rights enforcement and the public on the status of equal educational opportunity for all children, and build on the Strength in Diversity Act to increase federal funding for community-driven strategies to desegregate schools. All children have the Constitutional right to go to school. Schools should be safe zones for children and their families, which is why Democrats will protect sensitive locations like schools from immigration enforcement actions. Democrats believe that English learners should be recognized as bringing an asset, rather than a deficit, with them to school. We recognize the need for significantly increased funding and support for English learners to ensure they can participate meaningfully and equally in school. Democrats will protect the civil rights of limited English proficient parents so they receive information in the language they understand and are able to meaningfully participate in their child’s education, including through public meetings and community decision-making mechanisms. Democrats believe in providing equal educational opportunities for students with disabilities. We will fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and fully implement its requirements for a free appropriate public education and least restrictive environment. We will support aggressive enforcement of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, including the integration mandate of the Olmstead decision, and provide school districts with additional resources to better serve students with disabilities. We will ban seclusion and prevent and decrease use of physical restraint, in partnership with teachers, school administrators, and the disability rights movement. Democrats also support aggressive enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act in schools and other settings. The COVID-19 pandemic has made long-standing educational disparities evident to all Americans. Democrats will prioritize equitable education and access for students with disabilities, English language learners, low-income students, students of color, and urban and rural students, including those who are homeless, are immigrants or refugees, or are in the foster care or juvenile justice systems. Remote instruction must be individualized to the greatest possible extent and reasonable modifications should be provided for students with disabilities even during a pandemic. The evidence from nearly two decades of education reforms that hinge on standardized test scores shows clearly that high-stakes testing has not led to enough improvement in outcomes for students or for schools, and can lead to discrimination against students, particularly students with disabilities, students of color, low-income students, and English language learners. Democrats will work to end the use of such high-stakes tests and encourage states to develop reliable, continuous, evidence-based approaches to student assessment that rely on multiple and holistic measures that better represent student achievement. Assessments will provide families with clear, accessible, consistent information about how well schools are serving individual students and groups of students, while better representing student achievement. Students, parents, and educators will be supported by data collection and analysis disaggregated by race, gender, disability status, and other important variables, to identify and address disparities in educational equity, access, and outcomes. Educators have always been heroes. The COVID-19 pandemic has made the value that educators provide to children, parents, and the economy obvious as never before to tens of millions of Americans. Public school educators should have the same rights to organize, join a union, and collectively bargain as private sector workers. Democrats will fight to significantly increase pay and benefits for all educators, in order to help recruit, retain, and reward high-quality teachers and support professionals, and will continue to support measures to help teachers pay for out-of-pocket classroom expenses. We will support programs to help introduce high school students to the teaching profession, enable school support staff to climb the professional ladder within schools, and recruit a diverse educational workforce through partnerships with HBCUs, MSIs, and TCUs. Making Higher Education Affordable and Accessible Democrats believe that everyone should be able to earn a degree beyond high school, if they choose to, without money standing in the way. That is why we will make public colleges and universities tuition-free for students whose families earn less than $125,000—roughly 80 percent of the American people. We will double the maximum Pell Grant award for low-income students, and double federal support for TRIO programs that help first-generation college students, students with disabilities, veterans, and other underrepresented groups apply to and complete college. HBCUs, MSIs, and TCUs serve a disproportionate number of low-income students who might otherwise be unable to access a college degree, and yet these vital institutions are chronically under-resourced. Democrats will work to provide grants to HBCUs, MSIs, and TCUs to lower student costs, increase academic research capabilities, and ensure these essential institutions can continue to thrive in the future. Democrats support making community colleges and trade schools tuition-free for all students, including Dreamers. Our nation’s network of two-year community colleges provides accessible, high-quality education for students of all ages. Democrats will additionally support and expand pre-apprenticeship opportunities and registered apprenticeships with formal worker representation in program development to provide a clear pathway to high-quality jobs that does not require attending college. We will increase federal support for services like child care on college campuses, so more students are able to balance the demands of school and family and graduate with degrees. Democrats also support increased funding for wraparound services, including covering the cost of textbooks and fees for low-income students and establishing programs to address campus food insecurity, so students can focus on what matters most: their studies. Democrats will fight to create a federal funding program for higher education, modeled on Title I funding for K-12 schools, that would direct funds to public and nonprofit colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions based on the proportion of low-income students those schools enroll and graduate. We will promote transparency and fairness regarding higher education faculty working conditions, including adjuncts, graduate employees, and full-time lecturers who are often grossly underpaid compared to full professors, and support and encourage professor tenure. And Democrats will safeguard academic freedom on college campuses. Democrats oppose the Trump Administration’s cruel and capricious treatment of international students studying in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Young people around the world dream of coming to the United States, especially to study, innovate, and contribute to our research institutions, our economy, and our communities. Winning the competition for talents is a major component for winning global competitions in the 21st century. Democrats are committed to policies that make the United States welcoming to the more than one million international students who come to study in our colleges and universities annually, contributing to our higher education sector and to our nation's intellectual and cultural vibrancy. We will act to restore trust and certainty for international students and the higher education sector as part of the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and the Trump Administration's harmful policies toward international students. Providing Borrowers Relief from Crushing Student Debt Student debt is holding millions of Americans back. The COVID-19 pandemic and President Trump’s recession are making it harder for those with student loans to make ends meet right now. Democrats will work to authorize up to $10,000 in student debt relief per borrower to help families weather this crisis. Beyond that immediate relief, Democrats will also take steps to ease the burden of high monthly student loan payments through legislative and administration relief processes, including creating a simplified repayment process. Democrats will work to pause monthly billing and stop interest from accruing on federal student loans for people earning less than $25,000, and cap payments at no more than five percent of discretionary income for those earning more than $25,000. After 20 years, remaining federal student loan debt should be automatically forgiven without tax liability. For those earning less than $125,000, we support forgiving all undergraduate tuition-related federal student debt from two- and four-year public colleges and universities, and we will also apply this benefit to individuals holding federal student loans for tuition from private HBCUs and MSIs. Democrats support modernizing and improving the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, including making the enrollment process automatic for people who work in schools, government agencies, and non-profit organizations. We will also make the program more generous by forgiving up to $10,000 in student debt per year for up to five years, and apply this action to people who have already dedicated 5 years or less of service to working in our schools, government agencies, and non-profit organizations. We reject Republican proposals that, in the name of simplification, would make students pay billions of dollars more on their student loans. Not only will these measures make it easier for Americans to buy a home or start a small business, student debt forgiveness is key to helping address the racial wealth gap, as students of color are more likely to have to borrow to finance higher education. Democrats will also empower the CFPB to take action against exploitative lenders and will work with Congress to allow student debt to be discharged during bankruptcy. The Trump Administration has let for-profit colleges and universities once again prey upon students with impunity by repealing important protections. Democrats will crack down on predatory for-profit higher education programs, including by issuing requirements that these programs be able to demonstrate their value and effectiveness before becoming eligible for federal student loans. We will call upon the Secretary of Education to forgive debt carried by students who were ripped off by predatory schools, including by programs that defrauded students or that misrepresented program offerings or program outcomes, as well as debt held by people who are permanently disabled. And we will protect veterans and servicemembers from being steered into low-performing for-profit higher education and professional programs. RENEWING AMERICAN LEADERSHIP Democrats believe that we can only be strong in the world when we are strong and united at home. We believe that a healthy democracy, just society, and inclusive economy are essential prerequisites for effective American leadership abroad. And we believe that the ultimate measure —and purpose—of our foreign policy is whether it protects and advances America’s security, prosperity and values —and delivers results for all Americans. President Trump promised he would put “America First”—but Trump’s America stands alone. Under his leadership, America’s reputation and influence are in tatters. Our country is less safe, our economy more fragile, and our democracy, values, and unity endangered. Rather than advance our interests and values in a more competitive world, President Trump has retreated —allowing our adversaries to fill the void. He has attacked the sources of our strength, hollowed out American diplomacy, shredded international commitments, weakened our alliances, and tarnished our credibility. Rather than make smart investments to keep our military’s competitive edge, President Trump has wasted billions on vanity projects, barred patriotic Americans from serving their country, denied military families the care and support they have earned, and tried to use our women and men in uniform to sow fear and division. Rather than help Americans compete in the global economy, he’s launched reckless, politically-motivated tariff wars that have punished American workers, antagonized our allies, and benefited our adversaries. Rather than end our forever wars, he’s brought us to the brink of new conflicts, and further militarized our foreign policy. Rather than reduce nuclear dangers, he’s amplified them, and brought the world closer to catastrophe. Rather than stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our allies and partners, he’s betrayed them. Rather than defend democracy and human rights, he’s fawned over autocrats, sent love letters to despots, sided with dictators over peaceful protestors, and invited foreign interference in our elections. Rather than root out corruption, he’s made common cause with kleptocrats. Rather than fight the existential threat of climate change, he’s denied science and accelerated the damage. In every region and on every issue, American security and interests are at greater peril— and our rivals at greater advantage—than four years ago. Democrats believe four more years of Donald Trump will damage our influence beyond repair. But closing the chapter on “America First” is just the beginning of the work ahead. We must meet the world as it is today, not as it was before President Trump’s destruction. That’s why we cannot simply aspire to restore American leadership. We must reinvent it for a new era. We will revitalize the power and purpose of American diplomacy to compete in a more contested world. We will lead not just with the example of our power, but with the power of our example. We will place values at the center of our foreign policy. And we will reinvent alliances, partnerships, and international institutions to meet common challenges that no country can face on its own. The world today looks very different from the post-WWII period that gave birth to our alliance system. But these changes make our alliances more—not less—crucial to our success. We will ensure that our military has no peer. We owe it to our men and women in uniform and to the American public to spend our defense dollars more wisely and strategically —focused on building a force that can deter and win the conflicts of the 21st century. And we will use force only when necessary, always as a last resort, and with the informed consent of the American people. And, most importantly, Democrats will ensure that the reinvention of American leadership abroad prioritizes and accelerates our renewal at home. We will root a disciplined foreign policy in the needs and aspirations of the American middle class and the imperative of building a more dynamic, fair, and resilient society— the ultimate wellspring of our power. Revitalizing American Diplomacy Democrats will revitalize American diplomacy to ensure that the United States remains the world’s pivotal power and a principled force for peace and prosperity. The United States should be at the head of the table whenever the safety and well-being of Americans is at stake, working in common cause with our allies and partners. Time and again, the Trump Administration has stormed out, leaving America’s seat at the table vacant and American interests on the menu. Americans deserve better. Rebuilding America’s Tool of First Resort Democrats believe that diplomacy should be our tool of first resort. The world’s greatest power deserves to have the world’s very best diplomatic corps. But today, American diplomacy is badly adrift and under resourced, and our diplomats are demoralized. Democrats will support and invest in long overdue reforms to make the State Department more strategic, modern, agile, and effective. Rather than militarize our foreign policy, treat our diplomats with contempt, and call for reckless budget cuts, Democrats will put diplomacy back in the hands of professionals and ensure they are better prepared to advance American interests on the central issues of our time, like disruptive technology and climate change. We will recruit a new generation of Americans who want to serve their country abroad and ensure they have the training and tools they need. And we will expand and reform the Foreign Service so it reflects the diversity and richness of the country it represents. Reinventing Alliances Democrats believe America’s alliances are an irreplaceable cornerstone of our national security that should be cultivated, not cast away. Our allies offer an enormous strategic advantage that our rivals can’t match. They multiply our influence, spread our reach, lighten our burden, and advance our shared interests and priorities much farther than we could ever do on our own. President Trump has undermined our alliances in ways that our adversaries could have only dreamed of—sowing doubts about our commitments to diplomatic agreements, mutual defense, democratic values, and strategic purpose. As a result, our alliance system today faces its biggest test since the end of the Cold War. He has pushed to bring Russia back into the G7 while lambasting our NATO partners and ignoring intelligence about Russian bounties for killing American troops and other coalition forces in Afghanistan. He has undermined confidence in America’s commitment to the alliance’s Article 5 mutual defense provision, and threatened to pull troops out of Germany without consultation. In the midst of a nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula, he tried to extort our South Korean allies to dramatically increase their share of alliance costs. Democrats will not only repair our alliances, but reinvent them to advance mutual priorities and deal with new challenges. We believe our alliances are strongest when they are rooted in shared democratic values. That’s why we need to signal clearly our profound concerns about democratic backsliding in a number of ally states, and why we need to work with allied democracies to end democracy’s global recession. We will make developing shared responses to non-military threats like disinformation, corruption, and economic coercion, priorities in our agenda. We will work with our partners to improve interoperability, and we will encourage them to build up their defense capabilities, take greater responsibility for regional security, and contribute their fair share. But we will never treat our alliances like protection rackets. Democrats will not only reinvent existing alliances but also work to strengthen and build new partnerships in regions of growing strategic importance, particularly in Africa and Latin America. International Institutions Democrats believe that American security and prosperity are enhanced when the United States leads in shaping the rules, forging the agreements, and steering the institutions that guide international relations. We believe the system of international institutions we built and led over the past seven decades has generated an enormous return on our investment. And in today’s more competitive world, its renovation is a critical diplomatic priority. Unfortunately, President Trump has orchestrated an American retreat from global bodies that weakens our influence, cedes ground to our adversaries, and puts global peace and prosperity in jeopardy. Instead of walking away, Democrats believe the United States should lead the way and mobilize our partners to work in common cause. We will rejoin and reform the WHO, the United Nations Human Rights Council, and the United Nations Population Fund, because in a global public health crisis and a global democratic recession, American leadership is needed more than ever. We will work to modernize international institutions to make sure they are fit for purpose in the 21st century and responsible stewards of both public funds and the world’s trust. Foreign Assistance and Development Democrats believe that foreign assistance and development programs are powerful tools for promoting American, and global, security and prosperity. With less than one percent of its annual budget, the United States gets an extraordinary return on its investments in the prevention and alleviation of poverty, hunger, disease, and conflict, the empowerment of vulnerable and marginalized populations, and the opening of global markets for American business and exports to thrive. That’s why we will ensure that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) reclaims its position as the world’s premier development agency. And it’s why we reject the Trump Administration’s punitive and transactional approach to foreign aid and its use to advance domestic political errands at the expense of our national interests. Democrats will devote the resources and implement the reforms necessary to further multiply the impact of foreign assistance. We will reaffirm America’s commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and promote data efforts and transparency measures that ensure accountability and help identify areas for strategic investment. We will incorporate local perspectives, including from civil society partners, into the design, execution, and evaluation of our programs to secure lasting impact. And we will provide the budgetary support and statutory authorities necessary to make sure our aid institutions, including the new U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, are successfully integrated into broader international and private-sector development efforts. Democrats will lead international efforts to help developing countries withstand and recover from debt crises caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we will push for international standards that establish more transparency and sustainability in development financing. Transforming Our Armed Forces for the 21st century Democrats believe our military is—and must be—the most effective fighting force in the world. To keep it that way, we need to bring our forever wars to a responsible end, rationalize our defense budget, invest in the forces and technologies of the future, repair civil-military relations, and strengthen our covenant with service members, veterans, and military families. Ending Forever Wars Democrats know it’s time to bring nearly two decades of unceasing conflict to an end. Our military engagements, which have spanned from West Africa to Southeast Asia, have cost more than $5 trillion and claimed more than half a million lives. Our war in Afghanistan is the longest war in American history, with the youngest U.S. troops now fighting a war that was launched before they were even born. President Trump said he would get the United States out of these wars, but instead he deployed more combat forces, expanded their missions, and stoked regional tensions that unnecessarily endangered American lives and interests. Democrats will deliver on this overdue commitment to end the forever wars, and we will do it responsibly —setting priorities, leading with diplomacy, protecting ourselves from terrorist threats, enabling local partners, and bringing our troops home. Democrats are committed to a durable and inclusive political settlement in Afghanistan that ensures that al-Qaeda isn’t allowed to reconstitute, the Islamic State (ISIS) isn’t allowed to grow, and the international community can help Afghans safeguard hard-fought gains, especially for women and girls. Democrats will end support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen and help bring the war to an end. This war is responsible for the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, and it amplifies threats to the region and to our interests. Democrats believe that the United States should support diplomatic efforts—not block them. Democrats will not only end the wars that have cost so much American blood and treasure—we will apply their lessons. We will only use force when necessary to protect national security and when the objective is clear and achievable —with the informed consent of the American people, and where warranted, the approval of Congress. That is why we will work with Congress to repeal decades-old authorizations for the use of military force and replace them with a narrow and specific framework that will ensure we can protect Americans from terrorist threats while ending the forever wars. Rather than occupy countries and overthrow regimes to prevent terrorist attacks, Democrats will prioritize more effective and less costly diplomatic, intelligence, and law enforcement tools. We will right-size our counterterrorism footprint, put it in service of broader regional and overarching foreign policy objectives, and ensure it never undermines the values we seek to uphold. And we will mobilize our partners to make sustained investments that can prevent conflict and help extinguish the flames on which extremists feed. Securing our Competitive Edge Democrats believe the United States military should be the best-trained, best-equipped, and most effective fighting force in the world. Ending the forever wars, reducing the enormous stress on our forces, and rationalizing our global military footprint are essential prerequisites to securing our competitive edge—but they’re not enough. We will invest in technology and forces that meet the threats of the future—from cyber to space, and artificial intelligence to unmanned systems— and reinforce the alliances and partnerships that enhance our collective security. Rather than continuing to rely on legacy platforms that are increasingly exposed and vulnerable, Democrats support funding a more cost-effective, agile, flexible, and resilient force with modern transportation and logistics capabilities that can operate in more contested environments. Democrats will accelerate defense transformation in a responsible, ethical way, and with strong privacy protections. And we believe the implications of climate change for national security and the Department of Defense can no longer be an afterthought, but must be at the core of all policy and operational plans to secure our vital interests. Defense Spending Democrats believe the measure of our security is not how much we spend on defense, but how we spend our defense dollars and in what proportion to other tools in our foreign policy toolbox and other urgent domestic investments. We believe we can and must ensure our security while restoring stability, predictability, and fiscal discipline in defense spending. We spend 13 times more on the military than we do on diplomacy. We spend five times more in Afghanistan each year than we do on global public health and preventing the next pandemic. We can maintain a strong defense and protect our safety and security for less. It’s past time to rebalance our investments, improve the efficiency and competitiveness of our defense industrial base, conduct rigorous annual audits of the Pentagon, and end waste and fraud. Keeping Faith with Our Veterans and Military Families Democrats believe that our force is stronger when it reflects the richness and diversity of American society, and when we treat our service members, veterans, and their families with the dignity they’ve earned. We will protect and enhance opportunities for anyone who can meet the standards to serve in combat roles, and we will fight the scourge of rape and sexual assault in our military, end retaliation and impunity, and take care of survivors. We will reverse the Trump Administration’s hateful transgender ban, discriminatory exclusions in military health care, and policies that stigmatize and discriminate against people living with HIV and AIDS, and ensure that LGBTQ+ service members and families enjoy equal respect, benefits, and care. We will root out systemic racism from our military justice system, where black service members are twice as likely as white ones to face court-martial. We will accelerate efforts to recruit and promote people of color in the officer corps. We believe that service members, veterans, and their spouses should never face deportation. We will create a parole process for veterans deported by the Trump Administration to reunite them with their families and compatriots. And we believe anyone who has served honorably in our military has earned a path to citizenship prior to discharge or retirement. Democrats believe that the world’s best fighting force and its veterans deserve the world’s best health care. We will rebuild trust in, and accountability at, the VA —not privatize it. We will modernize VA facilities and bolster funding to the VA as part of a nationwide infrastructure plan, expand eligibility for VA benefits so that all veterans can access the VA, and work with Congress to eliminate VA cop-pays for preventive health care for veterans. We will ensure that VA benefits address the full needs of our women veterans, including reproductive services, and that every veteran receives comprehensive and culturally competent care and benefits regardless of their ethnicity, race, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and eliminate transgender exclusions. We will combat veteran homelessness, including by converting VA facilities into housing. Twenty veterans and service members take their life every day. We will treat suicide as the public health crisis it is. Today, only half of Afghanistan and Iraq veterans have access to the mental health services they need. That’s why we will invest in mental health and suicide prevention services, and work with our military communities to encourage and support those seeking help, connecting them to critical services. Democrats will provide the hundreds of thousands of service members that transition to civilian life with the support they need. Democrats will not abide exploitation of our veterans, especially by for-profit colleges that raid benefits and burden veterans with debt. Democrats believe that we can’t maintain the force we need unless we take care of military families— who have been asked to endure so much for so long, with far too little support. No military family should struggle to pay their bills, put food on the table, or access health care, quality housing, child care, or the workforce. We will ensure pay and compensation keep pace with the current economy. We will also increase time between deployments, improve educational outcomes for military children, and invest in career training, education, and entrepreneurship programs for military spouses, who face an unemployment rate twice the national average. We will expand tax credits to help family caregivers of our veterans, and ensure they receive the support they need from the VA and Department of Defense. And we will support efforts across the country to help veterans and military families thrive, enrich, and strengthen their communities and our nation. Civil-Military Relations Democrats believe that healthy civil-military relations are essential to our democracy and to the strength and effectiveness of our military. We will end the Trump Administration’s politicization of the armed forces and distortion of civilian and military roles in decision-making. We will reinstate national security policymaking processes that advance competent civilian control and appropriately incorporate military advice —not issue commands by tweet. We will safeguard the independence of the military justice system —not pardon war criminals. Democrats will hold regular press briefings to explain the legal and policy justifications for military operations, because transparency and open debate with Congress and the American public are necessary for democratic accountability. Democrats will never use active duty soldiers as political props, and we will never send military forces to suppress Americans exercising their constitutional rights. Mobilizing the World to Address Transnational Challenges Global Health and Pandemics The human and economic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the urgency of strengthening the global public health system —and the consequences of America’s disengagement from the world. The Trump Administration was warned about the clear and present danger of a global pandemic. The Administration not only ignored the threat but dismantled our early warning and response mechanisms and failed to act when the pandemic began. We owe it to all those whose lives have been shattered by this disease to learn from that fatal mistake. Democrats will take overdue steps to ensure our government is not caught off guard by public health threats, at home or abroad. We will revitalize and expand the Obama-Biden Administration’s Global Health Security Agenda, and we will immediately restore the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense. Democrats will also mobilize allies, partners, and international institutions to develop a more robust and effective global public health system. We will work to help the United Nations improve its facilitation efforts in public health crises, and we will establish a Global Health Emergency Board to harmonize crisis response for vulnerable communities. Rather than undercutting the WHO and undermining its work on the frontlines of global pandemic response, Democrats will ensure the United States remains its leading funder and technical partner. Democrats will fully resource the WHO, especially its Contingency Fund for Emergencies, while supporting fundamental reforms and mechanisms to enhance accountability and protect experts from political pressure. We support the development of a vaccine accelerator to ensure rapid, equitable, and affordable global access to vaccines, therapeutics, and supplies. Democrats know that effective global health policy saves lives at home and around the world. Beyond its immediate damage, the COVID-19 pandemic has badly disrupted routine, life-saving vaccinations, putting 80 million children around the world at greater risk of dying from preventable diseases. We will reaffirm our commitment to the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and help realize the promise of an AIDS-free generation. And we will help the world eradicate tuberculosis, malaria, and polio, as well as preventable maternal and childhood deaths. Climate Change Democrats recognize that the United States does not stand alone in the fight against climate change and global environmental degradation. We will fully integrate climate change into our foreign policy and national security strategies, and we will restore U.S. global climate leadership. Democrats will immediately rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, commit the United States to doing its fair share and lead the world in the effort to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and convene a world summit aimed at new and more ambitious global targets to reduce greenhouse gas pollution. We will revive and expand climate-related foreign assistance including by recommitting to the Green Climate Fund. We will protect our oceans—vital buffers against the impacts of climate change— through fisheries management programs and additional designations of marine protected areas. We will seek collaborative, science-based approaches to be good stewards of the rapidly changing Arctic region, while protecting our strategic interests. We will work to ratify the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol and move expeditiously to phase out super-polluting hydrofluorocarbons in the United States. We will restore funding to the Global Environment Facility and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to support critical climate science research around the world. We will support the protection of species and wildlife habitats around the world, including by advancing the goals of the United Nations Framework Convention on Biological Diversity, and encourage other countries to join us in conserving 30 percent of the planet by 2030. Democrats will also work with world leaders to catalyze increased global investments in clean energy solutions and climate resilience, including to help low-income countries move along a more sustainable development path. We will promote climate accountability and mobilize a united front to keep states like China from outsourcing pollution to other countries. Democrats believe that executing a strategy of bold climate leadership will require sustained focus and increased expertise across our foreign policy institutions. We will incorporate climate issues as key priorities at the Department of State, the Department of Defense, and in the Intelligence Community. And we will ensure that America’s service missions abroad, including those executed through the Peace Corps and USAID, expand their calls to action to include reducing carbon pollution, safeguarding Indigenous peoples and vulnerable populations from climate impacts, and guaranteeing a more sustainable planet for all. Technology Democrats believe that American diplomatic leadership is critical to maximizing the benefits of technological innovation while minimizing its risks and dislocations. We have a stake in bridging the gap between the pace of innovation and the development of rules of the road governing the most consequential domains of technology, from cyberspace to artificial intelligence to synthetic biology. Democrats will avoid a race to the bottom, where countries hostile to democratic values shape our future. Instead, we will mobilize public and private actors to ensure that new products and new discoveries are bound by law, ethics, and civil liberties protections that enable democratic societies to thrive and prosperity to be shared broadly. We will recommit the United States to the principles of an open internet, including net neutrality, and vigorously oppose efforts to digitally silo off countries and populations from the rest of the world. Democrats believe that algorithms and platforms should empower people instead of the surveillance state. We expect technology companies and social media platforms to take responsibility and do more to preserve the openness of democratic societies and identify foreign disinformation, especially including paid efforts to influence American elections through advertising or coordinated inauthentic behavior, and we will take steps to prevent the use of new technologies to facilitate repression, spread hate, or incite violence. Democrats recognize that the security of data is only becoming more vital across all threads of technological progress. That’s why we will work with our allies and partners to develop secure 5G networks and address threats in cyberspace. Democrats will maintain American capabilities that can deter cyber threats, and we will work with other countries—and the private sector—to protect individuals’ data and defend critical infrastructure, including the global financial system. We will also work to make sure that the revolution in biotechnology remains a force for global good. We will promote international efforts to responsibly and ethically manage research in areas like gene editing. We will sustain and improve international collaboration and data-sharing. And we will ensure equitable access to medical treatments and vaccines generated by new biotech discoveries. Democrats will partner with other countries and private companies to build up capacity and implement appropriate safety standards for any work that involves dangerous pathogens, and we remain staunchly committed to the international prohibition on the development or use of biological weapons. Nonproliferation Democrats believe the United States has a moral responsibility and national security imperative to prevent the spread of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, and eventually secure their elimination. Over the past four years, the Trump Administration has done precisely the opposite. Its brash nuclear threats, ill-considered withdrawals from critical arms control treaties and nuclear agreements, and reckless embrace of a new arms race have made the United States, and the world, less safe. Thanks to President Trump’s abdication of leadership, the nuclear dangers that Americans face are greater than they have been in decades. Democrats reject a return to an old era of grave nuclear dangers. Democrats believe that the sole purpose of our nuclear arsenal should be to deter—and, if necessary, retaliate against—a nuclear attack, and we will work to put that belief into practice, in consultation with our allies and military. We will work to maintain a strong, credible deterrent while reducing our overreliance and excessive expenditure on nuclear weapons. The Trump Administration’s proposal to build new nuclear weapons is unnecessary, wasteful, and indefensible. Democrats commit to strengthening the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, maintaining the moratorium on explosive nuclear weapons testing, pushing for the ratification of the UN Arms Trade Treaty and Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and extending New START. Just as was the case during the height of the Cold War, it’s in our interest to work with Russia to verifiably limit and reduce our nuclear stockpiles. We will build on this foundation to negotiate arms control agreements that reflect the emergence of new players like China, capture new technologies, and move the world back from the nuclear precipice. Terrorism So long as violent extremists continue to plot attacks on our homeland and our interests, Democrats will maintain a vigilant focus on counterterrorism. Democrats recognize that the threat landscape has evolved dramatically since September 11. Our counterterrorism priorities, strategies, footprint, and tools should shift accordingly, including to respond to the growing threat from white supremacist and other right-wing terrorist groups Democrats will sustain the global effort to defeat ISIS, al-Qaeda, and their affiliates. We will ensure that the world is equally committed to the difficult task that follows military success: dealing with the underlying conditions that allowed violent extremism to flourish in the first place. We will work with our partners to prioritize diplomatic, law enforcement, and intelligence tools, to reinforce our objectives instead of distorting them. Democrats believe that our rhetoric, policies, and tactics—and those of our counterterrorism partners—should never serve as terrorist recruiting tools. We will always work to avoid civilian casualties, and we will not weaponize counterterrorism for anti-immigrant purposes. We will reject the targeting of Muslim, Arab, and other racial and ethnic communities based on their faith and backgrounds at home and abroad. We will close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, enhance transparency, oversight, and accountability in counterterrorism programs and operations, and safeguard civil liberties and the rule of law. Democracy and Human Rights Around the world, democracy and human rights are under greater assault than they have been in a generation. Under President Trump, the United States has too often been part of the assault and too rarely engaged in the defense and promotion of universal values. Democrats believe that the fight for universal values should start at home, but it can’t end there. Global democratic backsliding and the erosion of human rights put our interests and values at risk. That’s why the reinvention of American leadership demands we put democratic values at the core of our foreign policy, with renewed strategies and tools for a new era. Democrats will make gender equality a key foreign policy priority and work to achieve gender parity across our national security team. We will implement the Women, Peace, and Security Act because advancing gender equality enhances stability and economic prosperity around the world. Along with our diplomatic partners, we will incorporate more women into peace processes —where their participation can improve the odds of a peace agreement holding— and ensure women’s leadership in peace and security processes globally. Democrats will lead international efforts to address the scourge of gender-based violence, and we will work to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. We will push for greater participation by women in the global workforce, which studies show can boost global GDP by 25 percent. Democrats will always protect sexual and reproductive health and rights. We believe that comprehensive health services, including access to reproductive care and abortion services, are vital to the empowerment of women and girls. We will support the repeal of the global gag rule (also known as the Mexico City Policy) and measures like the Helms Amendment, which limit safe access to abortion. We will also restore and expand American contributions to the United Nations Population Fund to help guarantee access to health care for women and children around the world and eliminate child, early, and forced marriage. Democrats will advance the ability of all persons to live with dignity, security, and respect, regardless of who they are or who they love. We will restore the United States’ position of leadership on LGBTQ+ issues by passing the GLOBE Act and appointing senior leaders directly responsible for driving and coordinating LGBTQ+ issues at the State Department, USAID, and the National Security Council. We will ensure that our immigration policies account for the needs of LGBTQ+ refugees and asylum seekers, and that we use the full slate of human rights promotion and accountability tools to defend the universal rights of LGBTQ+ people. We will amplify the voices of LGBTQ+ persons around the world and counter violence and discrimination against LGBTQ+ persons wherever it appears. Democrats will stand up for and support civil society around the world. Crackdowns on civic space in recent years have undermined democracy, the rule of law, and the vibrancy and health of societies. As autocrats leverage technology and employ arbitrary legal measures to shrink civic space, the United States should lead the world in adapting and bolstering support for civic activism. Democrats believe that the United States should defend freedom of the press. Independent media is not the enemy of the people, but the guardian of democracy. We will push back against erosion of press freedom wherever it occurs and in whatever form—whether through direct intimidation of, and violence against, journalists or legal, regulatory, and financial pressures that smother free speech. We will fight human trafficking and strive to end the practice of modern-day slavery around the world. We will aggressively leverage U.S. law enforcement and strengthen diplomatic efforts to combat forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation. And we will increase visas for victims of human trafficking at a time when mass migration has affected so many vulnerable communities. Democrats believe that improving labor standards around the world protects human rights and promotes broad-based prosperity. We will ensure that America’s diplomatic and trade agreements include enforcement provisions for workers’ rights, and we will fight to end the evils of poverty-wage, child, and slave labor. We believe that American workers should not be undercut by foreign competition that relies on the abuse of workers, and we will support the rights of unions and workers abroad to organize, including International Labor Organization Conventions supporting freedom of association and collective bargaining. Democrats believe that America should be a world leader when it comes to disability rights. We will work to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and we will appoint a Special Envoy for International Disability Rights. Across American diplomatic and development efforts, we will ensure that programs are disability-inclusive, and we will encourage partner countries and international organizations to address the needs of persons with disabilities. Democrats believe that freedom of religion and the right to believe—or not to believe—are fundamental human rights. We will never use protection of that right as a cover for discrimination. We reject the politicization of religious freedom in American foreign policy, and we condemn atrocities against religious minorities around the world—from ISIS’ genocide of Christians and Yezidis, to China’s mass internment of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities, to Burma’s persecution of the Rohingya, to attacks on religious minorities in Northeast Syria. Democrats believe that the United States should serve as a model for countries around the world when it comes to safeguarding and promoting the rights of Indigenous peoples. We will reaffirm the Obama-Biden Administration's support for, and strive to advance the principles of, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Consistent with the Declaration, the United States should urge the United Nations and the Organization of American States to create mechanisms that include the formal participation of Tribal nations. Democrats will work to secure a better future for younger generations. Roughly 40 percent of the world’s population is under 25, and the proportion of young people is even higher in the developing world. Democrats will ensure that our policies, and those of our partners and development institutions, work to increase economic opportunities, expand education, and improve health care for young people around the world. And we will pay special attention to protecting the rights of youth and nurturing young leaders from vulnerable or underrepresented communities. Democrats believe that the United States has an urgent, moral obligation and strategic interest to help alleviate suffering around the globe. Entrenched conflicts and unprecedented levels of forced migration have pushed the world into an acute humanitarian crisis that spills across borders. This year, almost 170 million people are going to need humanitarian assistance. By 2022 that figure could top 200 million, and need is poised to continue outstripping growth in humanitarian funding and capacity. Democrats will reassert America’s humanitarian example and leadership. We will contribute not just more aid, but better aid. The United States ought to drive the international community in providing more strategic, coordinated, proactive, predictable, and cost-effective funding —and in implementing programs that both reflect the realities of today’s increasingly complex and protracted humanitarian emergencies, and deliver on the health, education, and protection needs of populations devastated by conflict and displacement. In the midst of the worst forced displacement crisis since WWII, the Trump Administration launched a campaign to undermine the global system that provides crucial assistance to refugees and the countries that give them safe harbor. Democrats will end the Trump Administration’s shameful efforts to close doors to the world’s most vulnerable. We will reverse discriminatory bans and policies that deny protection to groups based on their religion, gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity. We will significantly raise the annual global refugee admissions target, and work with Congress to create a minimum annual number for refugee admissions, while expanding and identifying new pathways for refugees to seek safe havens. Admitting refugees is not only the right thing to do —it’s the smart thing to do. Bringing in those seeking a better life helps preserve the stability of America’s partners abroad, strengthens our hand in getting other countries to uphold their obligations, grows our own economy, and enriches our society. Democrats believe that torture is immoral and ineffective. President Trump’s fondness for torture and other war crimes only gives fodder to America’s enemies. Democrats will immediately reaffirm the Obama-Biden Administration’s ban on torture and commit to upholding American values at home and abroad. We will condemn the mistreatment of imprisoned individuals wherever it occurs, and we will hold to account those who perpetrate human rights abuses. Advancing American Interests Global Economy and Trade Democrats will fight for every American job and will make sure American workers have a fair shot in the global economy. For too long, the global trading system has failed to keep its promises to American workers. Too many corporations have rushed to outsource jobs, and too many countries have reneged on commitments to be honest and transparent partners. We will not negotiate any new trade deals before first investing in American competitiveness at home. We will aggressively enforce existing trade laws and agreements. And we will insist on strong and enforceable standards for labor, human rights, and the environment in any future trade agreements, so that they build the American middle class, create jobs, raise wages, and strengthen our communities. We will use all tools at our disposal to take action against countries that steal American intellectual property or manipulate their currencies to get an unfair advantage in international markets. Democrats believe that if the United States does not work with its allies and partners to shape the terms of global trade, China will shape them for us —and American working families and the middle class will pay the price. That’s why we will work with our allies to mobilize more than half the world’s economy to stand up to China and negotiate from the strongest possible position. Democrats believe that fighting for American workers also means pushing back against global corruption, and we will make anti-corruption a priority in our foreign policy. The Trump Administration’s own shady dealings and its enthusiasm for authoritarianism abroad have only emboldened the world’s autocrats and kleptocrats. Democrats will implement new transparency measures aimed at preventing illicit money from flowing through the American financial system, including a ban on anonymous shell companies, expansions of anti-money laundering requirements, disclosure of beneficial ownership, and greater oversight of cross-border transactions. We will combat bribery abroad by expanding on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and we will deploy the full range of America’s diplomatic and economic tools to target kleptocrats —including targeted sanctions and visa bans. When used strategically—as one of the tools employed, alongside our allies, to achieve clear policy objectives—financial and economic sanctions are an effective way to advance many core U.S. national security objectives. But when misused and overused, sanctions not only undermine our interests, they threaten one of the United States’ greatest strategic assets: the importance of the American financial system. Democrats will guard against the improper application of economic and financial sanctions that incentivize foreign businesses to bypass our financial system, corrode the power and potential of sanctions, undercut the potential of our diplomacy, hurt our economy, and threaten the key role of the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency. Africa Democrats will revitalize our partnerships across Africa to unleash enormous potential for growth and innovation and address together challenges and stresses across the continent. Africa is home to some of the world’s fastest growing economies. Its population will roughly double to more than two billion by the middle of this century, and Nigeria is projected to have the third largest population in the world. American diplomacy can play a critical role in helping ensure that the region’s vulnerabilities to climate change and pandemic disease—and persistent challenges of regional conflict, illicit financial flows, poor governance, and food, water, and health insecurity—do not overwhelm its enormous opportunities. At a moment when U.S.-Africa ties are increasingly important to our interests and our economy, and when our friends and rivals are investing more resources and diplomatic attention across the continent, the Trump Administration has treated Africa and its people with neglect and contempt. We will repair our relationships with African partners and publics, renewing our commitment to fight for democracy and human rights; advance peace and security; bolster economic growth and public health; and promote clean energy, sustainable agriculture, environmental protection, and decent work for all with special regard for youth and women. Democrats will recommit to the Obama-Biden Administration’s National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking and ban importation into the United States of hunting trophies from Africa’s iconic and endangered big cats. Democrats will seize opportunities to strengthen fragile political transitions in Sudan and Ethiopia while deepening relations with key partners. We will not shirk from our longstanding pledge to assist countries in Central Africa, the Sahel, and the Horn of Africa to counter extremism and address root causes of insecurity. We will support the implementation of the African Union’s African Continental Free Trade Agreement and its Agenda 2063 and promote a multi-faceted economic engagement focused on increasing two-way and regional trade, promoting investment and partnership in key industries. And we will assist in Africa’s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic while expanding efforts to improve the resiliency of health systems across the continent. Moreover, we will stand in solidarity with our African counterparts against structural racism in the United States and abroad, and commit to elevate African voices in multilateral forums to solve the world’s most pressing problems. Americas Democrats believe the Western Hemisphere is America’s strategic home base —a region bound together by common values, history, and vision of a more prosperous, democratic, and secure future. When the United States hosts the region’s leaders at next year’s Summit of the Americas—the first to be held here since the 1994 inaugural meeting in Miami—we will turn the page on the Trump Administration’s denigration and extortion of our neighbors, and we will chart a new era of cooperation based on partnership and shared responsibility for the region we all call home. Democrats will reaffirm the importance of North America to U.S. global economic competitiveness. We will ensure the USMCA lives up to its commitment to create prosperity for American workers, and we will strictly enforce compliance with its labor and environmental provisions. We will reinvigorate and build upon the North American Plan for Animal and Pandemic Influenza launched under the Obama-Biden Administration and work with our partners to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused the biggest economic decline in history across Latin America and the Caribbean. Rather than coerce our neighbors into supporting cruel migration policies, we will work with our regional and international partners to address the root causes of migration—violence and insecurity, weak rule of law, lack of educational and economic opportunity, pervasive corruption, and environmental degradation. Rather than encourage climate denial and environmental devastation, we will rally the world to protect the Amazon from deforestation, protect Indigenous peoples, and help vulnerable nations in the Caribbean and Central America adapt to the impacts of climate change. And rather than imitate populist demagogues, we will link arms with our neighbors to realize our shared aspirations for the region’s future. We will reject President Trump’s failed Venezuela policy, which has only served to entrench Nicolás Maduro’s dictatorial regime and exacerbate a human rights and humanitarian crisis. To rise to the occasion of the world’s worst refugee crisis and worst humanitarian crisis outside a warzone in decades, the United States will mobilize its partners across the region and around the world to meet the urgent needs of the people of Venezuela, and grant Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelans in the United States. Democrats believe that the best opportunity to rescue Venezuela’s democracy is through smart pressure and effective diplomacy, not empty, bellicose threats untethered to realistic policy goals and motivated by domestic partisan objectives. Democrats will also move swiftly to reverse Trump Administration policies that have undermined U.S. national interests and harmed the Cuban people and their families in the United States, including its efforts to curtail travel and remittances. Rather than strengthening the regime, we will promote human rights and people-to-people exchanges, and empower the Cuban people to write their own future. Asia-Pacific As a Pacific power, the United States should work closely with its allies and partners to advance our shared prosperity, security, and values —and shape the unfolding Pacific Century. Democrats’ approach to China will be guided by America’s national interests and the interests of our allies, and draw on the sources of American strength —the openness of our society, the dynamism of our economy, and the power of our alliances to shape and enforce international norms that reflect our values. Undermining those strengths will not make us “tough on China.” It would be a gift to the Chinese Communist Party. Democrats will be clear, strong, and consistent in pushing back where we have profound economic, security, and human rights concerns about the actions of China’s government. Democrats will protect the American worker from unfair trade practices by the Chinese government, including currency manipulation and benefiting from a misaligned exchange rate with the dollar, illegal subsidies, and theft of intellectual property. We will rally friends and allies across the world to push back against China or any other country’s attempts to undermine international norms. Democrats believe the China challenge is not primarily a military one, but we will deter and respond to aggression. We will underscore our global commitment to freedom of navigation and resist the Chinese military’s intimidation in the South China Sea. Democrats are committed to the Taiwan Relations Act and will continue to support a peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people of Taiwan. Rather than stand with President Xi Jinping as he cracks down on Hong Kong’s autonomy, Democrats will stand for the democratic rights of its citizens. We will fully enforce the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, including by sanctioning officials, financial institutions, companies, and individuals responsible for undercutting Hong Kong’s autonomy. And we will bring the world together to condemn the internment of more than one million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in concentration camps in China, using the tools provided by the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act. Democrats will pursue this strategy without resorting to self-defeating, unilateral tariff wars or falling into the trap of a new Cold War. Those mistakes would only serve to exaggerate China’s weight, over-militarize our policy, and hurt American workers. America must approach our relationship with China with confidence —the confidence to lead international efforts to push back on malign behavior while also pursuing cooperation on issues of mutual interest like climate change and nonproliferation and ensuring that the U.S.-China rivalry does not put global stability at risk. Rather than denigrate our partners and encourage tensions between our allies, the United States will work to strengthen ties with and between our key allies in the region, including Japan, South Korea, and Australia, and we will work to ensure that our alliances with Thailand and the Philippines live up to the values that our peoples share. Together with our allies —and through diplomacy with North Korea — we will constrain and contain the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear program and its regional belligerence. We will build a sustained, coordinated diplomatic campaign to advance the longer-term goal of denuclearization. And we will not forget the people of North Korea— Democrats will support humanitarian aid and pressure the regime to cease its gross human rights abuses. We will reinvigorate our commitment to robust engagement with regional multilateral institutions like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which will help us promote the rule of law and sustainable, inclusive economic growth on both sides of the Pacific. And we will continue to invest in our strategic partnership with India—the world’s largest democracy, a nation of great diversity, and a growing Asia-Pacific power. Europe In the 30 years since the fall of the Berlin wall, the United States and Europe have strived to build a transatlantic community of free and democratic societies that works together to bring peace, prosperity, and dignity to all our citizens. The Trump Administration has put that dream in grave danger. Donald Trump either does not know or has forgotten who America’s friends are. He sees Europe as a foe—not a friend—of the United States. He sees Vladimir Putin’s Russia as a strategic partner—not a strategic rival. He sees anti-European Union, far-right nationalists as political allies—not destructive antagonists. Democrats, on the other hand, believe a united, democratic, and prosperous Europe is vital to the United States. We believe the transatlantic alliance is the ballast of our global influence. Ours is the largest economic relationship in the world, making up nearly half of global GDP. NATO is the world’s most formidable military alliance. And together, we stand as champions of universal rights and freedoms around the world. Transatlantic cooperation is crucial to addressing almost every global challenge we face. Democrats will reinvigorate the transatlantic partnership to repair the damage of the Trump era and preempt the risks of broader structural divergence between the U.S. and Europe. We will work together with individual European countries and the European Union to counter threats to our democracies and enhance shared resilience against corruption and kleptocracy. We will support greater European integration, stronger defense capabilities, and greater energy security. We will enhance our coordination and joint standard setting on technology, trade, and investment, and we will work to boost our post-COVID-19 economic recovery and reduce inequality. Democrats will join our European partners in standing up to a revanchist Russia. We will not allow Moscow to interfere in our democracies or chip away at our resolve. We will reaffirm America’s commitment to NATO and defending our allies. We will maintain transatlantic support for Ukraine’s reform efforts and its territorial integrity. Democrats will lower regional—and global—threats by reinforcing nuclear arms control. We believe Europe is our natural partner in managing areas of competition with China and will work to establish common priorities, strategies, and tools. And just as we came together to stand up to communism and respond to global terrorism, we will come together with Europe to confront the existential challenge of climate change. Middle East Turning the page on two decades of large-scale military deployments and open-ended wars in the Middle East does not mean the United States will abandon a region where we and our partners still have enduring interests. Democrats believe it’s past time, however, to rebalance our tools, engagement, and relationships in the Middle East away from military intervention— leading with pragmatic diplomacy to lay the groundwork for a more peaceful, stable, and free region. Democrats will call off the Trump Administration’s race to war with Iran and prioritize nuclear diplomacy, de-escalation, and regional dialogue. Democrats believe the United States should not impose regime change on other countries and reject that as the goal of U.S. policy toward Iran. We believe the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) remains the best means to verifiably cut off all of Iran’s pathways to a nuclear bomb. The Trump Administration’s unilateral withdrawal from the JCPOA isolated us from our allies and opened the door for Iran to resume its march toward a nuclear weapons capacity that the JCPOA had stopped. That’s why returning to mutual compliance with the agreement is so urgent. The nuclear deal was always meant to be the beginning, not the end, of our diplomacy with Iran. Democrats support a comprehensive diplomatic effort to extend constraints on Iran’s nuclear program and address Iran’s other threatening activities, including its regional aggression, ballistic missile program, and domestic repression. Democrats also believe we need to reset our relations with our Gulf partners to better advance our interests and values. The United States has an interest in helping our partners contend with legitimate security threats; we will support their political and economic modernization and encourage efforts to reduce regional tensions. But we have no interest in continuing the blank-check era of the Trump Administration, or indulging authoritarian impulses, internal rivalries, catastrophic proxy wars, or efforts to roll back political openings across the region. Effective relations with the Gulf will help us reconnect Iraq to its neighbors and protect the country’s stability, security, and sovereignty. Democrats support a small, finite, and focused military presence to train our Iraqi partners so they can ensure the lasting defeat of ISIS. We also support keeping up the offensive against ISIS in Syria to prevent it from regaining a foothold, and will stand by Kurdish and other critical partners in that fight. We will work to repatriate foreign fighter detainees, and reinvigorate diplomacy to protect the humanitarian needs and human and civil rights of all Syrians and find a political resolution for this horrific war. Democrats are deeply concerned by the deepening crisis in Lebanon and are committed to work with the Lebanese people to promote political and economic reform, financial stability, and security. Democrats believe a strong, secure, and democratic Israel is vital to the interests of the United States. Our commitment to Israel’s security, its qualitative military edge, its right to defend itself, and the 2016 Memorandum of Understanding is ironclad. Democrats recognize the worth of every Israeli and every Palestinian. That’s why we will work to help bring to an end a conflict that has brought so much pain to so many. We support a negotiated two-state solution that ensures Israel’s future as a Jewish and democratic state with recognized borders and upholds the right of Palestinians to live in freedom and security in a viable state of their own. Democrats oppose any unilateral steps by either side—including annexation—that undermine prospects for two states. Democrats will continue to stand against incitement and terror. We oppose settlement expansion. We believe that while Jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations, it should remain the capital of Israel, an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths. Democrats will restore U.S.-Palestinian diplomatic ties and critical assistance to the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza, consistent with U.S. law. We oppose any effort to

believe that diversity is our greatest strength. that protest is among the highest forms of patriotism. that our fates and fortunes are bound to rise and fall together. that even when we fall short of our highest ideals, we never stop trying to build a more perfect union. when the american people go to the polls this fall, we will be choosing more than a candidate. character is on the ballot in this election. the character of our president, yes, but more than that: the character of our democracy, our society, and our leadership in the world. the challenges before us—the worst public health crisis in a century, the worst economic downturn since the great depression, the worst period of global upheaval in a generation, the urgent global crisis posed by climate change, the intolerable racial injustice that still stains the fabric of our nation—will test america’s character like never before. the covid- pandemic has laid bare deep-seated problems in our society— the fragility of our economy and social safety net, the risks posed by growing inequality, the impacts of racial and economic disparities on health and well-being, and the profound consequences of deepening polarization and political paralysis. the bill has come due on the trump administration’s hollowing out of our public institutions: the sidelining of experts, the rejection of science, the underinvestment in research, and the gross corruption and abuses of power. president trump’s dereliction of duty has caused the deaths of tens of thousands of americans, the loss of tens of millions of american jobs, and lasting harm to our children’s education and future. and it has revealed, at tragic economic and human cost, the emptiness of the republican party’s “america first” foreign policy. under president trump, america stands alone. friends and foes alike neither admire nor fear president trump’s leadership—they dismiss and ridicule it. the republican party under president trump has made america small— when we are a people called to do the greatest things. democrats will fight to repair the soul of this nation. to unite and to heal our country. to turn this crisis into a crucible, from which we will forge a stronger, brighter, and more equitable future. we must right the wrongs in our democracy, redress the systemic injustices that have long plagued our society, throw open the doors of opportunity for all americans, and reinvent our institutions at home and our leadership abroad. we do not simply aspire to return our country to where we were four years ago. we know we must be bolder and more ambitious. we must once again stop another republican recession from becoming a second great depression. president trump and the republican party have rigged the economy in favor of the wealthiest few and the biggest corporations, and left working families and small businesses out in the cold. democrats will forge a new social and economic contract with the american people—a contract that creates millions of new jobs and promotes shared prosperity, closes racial gaps in income and wealth, guarantees the right to join or form a union, raises wages and ensures equal pay for women and paid family leave for all, and safeguards a secure and dignified retirement. we must guarantee health care not as a privilege for some, but as a right for every single american. for a century, democrats have fought to secure universal health care. in the depths of the covid- pandemic, president trump and the republican party are trying to tear health care away from millions of people who depend on it for survival. democrats will not allow that to happen. we will not rest until every american can access quality health care and affordable prescription drugs. we must steel and strengthen our democracy, not distort and debase it. democrats believe there is nothing to fear from the voices and votes of the american people. we will restore the full power of the voting rights act and stamp out voter suppression in all its forms. we will curb the corrupting influence of money in politics and protect the integrity of our elections from all enemies, foreign and domestic. we will never accept political gridlock as our fate. we will never tire in our fight to deliver results and create opportunity for all americans. and we will end the war on government that has politicized our institutions, denigrated public service, and left the american people on their own instead of working to make them whole. we must heal our nation’s deepest wounds, not fan the flames of hate. democrats will root out structural and systemic racism in our economy and our society, and reform our criminal justice system from top to bottom, because we believe black lives matter. we will ensure that our nation continues to prize diversity and compassion, and welcomes those who yearn to participate in our great democratic experiment by creating a humane, 21st century immigration system that benefits all americans. we will give hate no safe harbor. we will never amplify or legitimize the voices of racism, misogyny, anti-semitism, anti-muslim bigotry, or white supremacy. democrats will protect and promote the equal rights of all our citizens—women, lgbtq+ people, religious minorities, people with disabilities, native americans, and all who have been discriminated against in too many ways and for too many generations. we commit ourselves to the vision articulated by frederick douglass of “a government founded upon justice, and recognizing the equal rights of all.” we must lead the world in taking on the climate crisis, not deny the science and accelerate the damage. from houston, texas, to mexico beach, florida; from san juan, puerto rico, to davenport, iowa, the last four years have seen record-breaking storms, devastating wildfires, and historic floods. democrats will rejoin the paris climate agreement and go further, building a thriving, equitable, and globally competitive clean energy economy that puts workers and communities first, and leaves no one behind. we must provide a world-class education in every zip code, to every child, because education is a critical public good. democrats believe in universal early childhood education, and affordable, high-quality child care. we will shut down the school-to-prison pipeline, and build a school-to-opportunity pipeline in its place. we will make college affordable again, and give americans relief from crushing student debt. we commit to a foreign policy that accelerates our domestic renewal, not undermines it. we will focus on what matters most to americans—more and better jobs, greater security , a cleaner environment, and a more inclusive and resilient society. democrats will lead with diplomacy as our tool of first resort and mobilize our allies and partners to meet the tests none of us can meet on our own. we will stand up to the forces of authoritarianism, not aid and abet their rise, and we will speak and act with clarity and purpose on behalf of human rights wherever they are under threat. and we will honor our sacred covenant with our women and men in uniform, our veterans, and our military families who have carried the burdens of wars that must—at long last—come to an end. above all, democrats still believe in the american idea—its principles, its purpose, and its promise. we know that four more years of the crass, craven, corrupt leadership we have seen from donald trump and the republican party will damage our character and our country beyond repair. we pray, as langston hughes did, “o, let america be america again—the land that never has been yet—and yet must be—the land where every man is free.” democrats call on all americans to come together and seize this last, best chance to restore the soul of our nation —and vote this november to ensure our greatest days are still to come. protecting americans and recovering from the covid- pandemic when we do not have competent, experienced, compassionate leaders in government, the american people suffer. that is the case with the novel coronavirus. president trump and his administration missed multiple opportunities to protect the american people from this deadly pathogen. instead of recognizing the danger and confronting it head-on, president trump lied to the american people about the disease’s severity, its transmissibility, and the threat it posed to lives and livelihoods. make no mistake: president trump’s abject failure to respond forcefully and capably to the covid- pandemic—his failure to lead—makes him responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of americans. covid- has laid bare deep fault lines in our economy, our society, and our health care system. disparities in health care access, in access to paid sick leave, in environmental quality, in the employment market, and in housing have contributed to disproportionate rates of infection and death among black americans, native americans, latinos, and certain asian american and pacific islander communities. president trump’s failure to pay attention to early intelligence reports about the pandemic wasted critical weeks in which we could have prepared for the outbreak. once the pandemic began spreading in the united states, the president’s failure to lay out clear, consistent guidelines for cities, states, businesses, and school districts to control the spread of covid- created widespread confusion and chaos. his reckless disregard for the advice of public health experts has made it harder for mayors and governors to protect the american people. rather than surge the production of personal protective equipment and other critical supplies where they were needed most, the administration held life-saving resources hostage for political obeisance. instead of bringing americans together, president trump tried to divide us, using racist and xenophobic rhetoric that has contributed to an increase in hate crimes against asian americans and pacific islanders. and in the midst of the pandemic, the trump administration is arguing in court to invalidate the affordable care act and rip health coverage away from tens of millions of people. president trump and his administration have also failed to drive an economic response that is commensurate with the scale of the challenge before us, preferring to act as though the recession caused by his incompetent mishandling of the covid- pandemic will correct itself. he has hung small businesses out to dry while cutting blank checks to the largest corporations; failed to enact adequate support for public school systems, colleges, universities, and state and local governments to maintain public services and jobs; endangered the health of essential workers by failing to enact workplace safety standards; and neglected to protect working families from economic ruin. democrats will save lives by using every available tool to beat back this pandemic, which continues to sicken and kill hundreds of americans per day, and lead a global effort to prevent, detect, and respond to future pandemic threats. we must start by making covid- testing widely available, convenient, and free to everyone. we must also expand funding so state and local public health departments can hire sufficient staff to conduct contact tracing for everyone who tests positive for the novel coronavirus. only through widespread, regular testing and tracing can we hope to understand the scope of the pandemic and contain it. in a public health crisis, we all have to rely on each other. that’s why democrats support making covid- testing, treatment, and any eventual vaccines free to everyone, regardless of their wealth, insurance coverage, or immigration status. we are all only as safe from this disease as are the most vulnerable among us. it has always been a crisis that tens of millions of americans have no or inadequate health insurance—but in a pandemic, it’s catastrophic for public health. the current crisis would be even worse without the affordable care act in place. but in the covid- pandemic, americans need even more help, which is why democrats will take immediate action to preserve and expand health insurance coverage. we will provide direct, increased support to states to enroll eligible adults in medicaid, have the federal government cover a higher percentage of the bill, and add incentives for states which have not yet expanded medicaid to do so. for people who risk losing their insurance coverage if they lose their jobs in this pandemic and in president trump’s recession, democrats believe the federal government should pick up percent of the tab for cobra insurance, which keeps people on their employer-sponsored plans, without restrictions. we will re-open the affordable care act marketplaces, even outside of the normal open enrollment season, and expand subsidies to make it easier for people to buy health coverage. democrats will also make available on the marketplace a public option administered through the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) which includes a platinum-level choice, with low fees and no deductibles. low-income americans will be automatically enrolled in the public option at zero cost to them, though they may choose to opt out at any time. we will keep these emergency measures in place until the pandemic ends and unemployment falls significantly. and should the united states find itself in another pandemic or severe economic downturn in the future, these protections will be made automatically available, so americans are never again left to fend for themselves in times of crisis. democrats are appalled that president trump failed to act on the advice of congress to maintain a strong stockpile of critical medical supplies, including personal protective equipment, or adequately surge u.s. manufacturing of needed equipment through tools like the defense production act. the resulting equipment shortages endangered millions of lives, including those of our brave frontline health care workers and other essential workers. such shortages are unacceptable and must never happen again. democrats will direct the federal government to work with private-sector manufacturers to dramatically scale up the united states’ domestic manufacturing capacity for both personal protective equipment and essential medicines. we will restore federal leadership to ensure medical supplies are distributed according to need, not political favoritism, and never put states in the position of having to compete against each other for life-saving materials. democrats will aggressively enforce non-discrimination protections in the americans with disabilities act and other civil rights laws, especially when designing emergency management systems and new facilities and services in response to the pandemic. democrats will prohibit unjustified segregation of patients with disabilities, and additionally prohibit rationing of health care that refuses or diverts hospitalization, treatment, or supplies based on a patient’s disability. we recognize people with disabilities living in group homes and other care facilities are at greater risk of contracting covid-, and that people with disabilities may require additional resources to protect their health, well-being, and independence during the pandemic. we will improve oversight and expand protections for residents and staff at nursing homes, which have seen some of the worst covid- outbreaks. and we will expand support for telemedicine, so americans do not have to go without essential health care during the pandemic. america must never again be left vulnerable to a global pandemic. democrats believe we must follow the informed advice of scientists and public health experts, and will take steps to protect federal scientists from political influence. democrats will act swiftly to stand up a comprehensive, national public health surveillance program for covid- and future infectious diseases. we will recruit at least , contact tracers with support from trusted local organizations in the communities most at risk to help state and local health departments use culturally competent approaches to identify people at risk of contracting or spreading the coronavirus. democrats believe we must reverse decades of underinvestment in america’s public health infrastructure. we will substantially increase funding for the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) and for state and local public health departments, many of which suffered deep budget cuts during the great recession and are at risk of further cuts as a result of president trump’s recession. state and local public health departments should be given sufficient resources to address pandemic diseases and other public health crises through coordinated efforts that are inclusive of underrepresented groups who may be disproportionately impacted. democrats will support medical and public health research grants for historically black colleges and universities (hbcus) and other minority-serving institutions (msis), which are particularly well suited to research health disparities in the context of covid-. solving the public health crisis posed by the pandemic is the surest way to get the economy back on track. countries that have taken aggressive measures to address the covid- pandemic and stop chains of infection from spreading are poised to have stronger, faster recoveries than the united states. but containing the pandemic won’t be enough to repair the damage president trump has done to our economy and to the american people—or to build back better. during acute economic downturns, democrats believe that we must take care of our workforce and aim to keep workers whole. we will reform the current unemployment insurance system to enable more workers to remain attached to their jobs, including by promoting payroll support and work-sharing programs with generous rates of wage replacement and requirements that employers maintain workers’ benefits. for those workers who do lose their jobs, we will expand the unemployment insurance system to cover more workers, including independent contractors and gig, part-time, and tipped workers; make sure platform companies and companies that misclassify employees as contractors pay in to support the system like other employers do ; and raise wage replacement rates, which are far too low in many states. we will expand, not cut, nutrition assistance and food security programs that millions of americans are relying on in this crisis. democrats will also make long-overdue investments to upgrade and modernize states’ unemployment system technology and ensure the department of labor conducts strong oversight of state unemployment systems to make sure that unemployed workers can quickly and efficiently access the benefits they are owed. to prevent president trump’s recession from becoming a depression, democrats believe we must act immediately to make ambitious investments that will support and create jobs. we urgently need to support state and local governments, which are suffering severe budget shortfalls due to declines in tax revenues while being asked to shoulder the burden of covid-related services and rising unemployment. state and local budget cuts translate quickly into lost jobs in education, health care, and social services—all fields where we need to be adding jobs to meet the needs of the american people. democrats will extend significant aid to state and local governments, school districts , and public and nonprofit colleges and universities, including hbcus and msis, to address these budget shortfalls and secure jobs. we will condition state and federal aid on maintaining and expanding public-sector employment, including provisions to protect workers’ rights. in states and cities across the country, too many parents are being forced to choose between keeping their jobs and keeping their children safe. democrats believe that making child care affordable and widely available is essential to recovering from the covid- pandemic. we will provide funding to stabilize the sector and ensure child care and educational settings are able to meet the highest possible public health and worker safety standards to protect the health of care workers, children, parents, and the broader community. the united states is facing an unprecedented housing crisis as a result of the covid- pandemic and president trump's recession, with millions of families at risk of being evicted. we support state and local measures to freeze rent increases, evictions, utility shutoffs, and late fees for rent, to prevent families from becoming homeless and making the pandemic even worse. the covid- pandemic has hit small businesses especially hard. democrats support making significant, immediate grants and loans to help small businesses make payroll, pay rent and other expenses, and keep their doors open when possible. some estimates indicate as many as percent of black-owned small businesses may not survive president trump’s recession, and small businesses owned by asian americans and pacific islanders and latinos are also at risk. democrats will prioritize support for black entrepreneurs and other entrepreneurs of color, as well as women entrepreneurs , including by expanding funding for community development financial institutions (cdfis) and other proven programs that invest in low-income communities and communities of color. we will impose rigorous oversight on big corporations seeking financial assistance to weather the pandemic and president trump’s recession, to ensure that federal dollars support keeping workers on payroll, not enriching ceos or shareholders. taxpayer money should not be used to pay out dividends, fund stock buybacks, or give raises to executives. no one should have to choose between protecting their health and earning a living. paid sick leave is a necessity even under normal circumstances, but in a pandemic, it’s a matter of national security. this is especially true for the black, latino, asian american and pacific islander, native american, and low-income workers who are less likely to be able to work from home. we will immediately enact robust paid sick leave protections as part of the covid- response for all workers in the economy, including contractors, gig workers, domestic workers, and the self-employed. and democrats will take immediate action to protect essential workers on the job where the trump administration has neglected them, from agriculture to meatpacking plants to manufacturing facilities to hospitals, including by issuing and enforcing effective infectious disease workplace safety standards through the occupational safety and health administration. as millions of americans have stayed at home to prevent the spread of the pandemic, it is plain to see that in the 21st century, an accessible internet is not optional: it is a vital tool for receiving an education and for participating in the economy, and all americans need access to high-speed, affordable broadband service. democrats will take action to prevent states from blocking municipalities and rural co-ops from building publicly-owned broadband networks, and increase federal support for municipal broadband while requiring that funding recipients adhere to policies that support good jobs and include strong protections for workers’ right to organize. we will increase public investment in rural, urban, and tribal broadband infrastructure, offer low-income americans subsidies for accessing high-speed internet , and invest in digital literacy training programs, so children and families and people with disabilities can fully participate in school, work, and life from their homes. and democrats will restore the federal communications commission's (fcc) clear authority to take strong enforcement action against broadband providers who violate net neutrality principles through blocking, throttling, paid prioritization, or other measures that create artificial scarcity and raise consumer prices for this vital service. president trump and his administration have not only failed the american people, they have failed the world. in past public health crises, including the ebola epidemic, disciplined american diplomacy shaped and led a common global response, rallied public and private resources, accelerated research into treatments and vaccines, and directed global emergency aid. in the covid- pandemic, president trump not only failed to lead, he actively sabotaged global efforts to slow the pandemic. he refused to work with our partners to identify and coordinate manufacture of potential vaccines; allegedly tried to poach exclusive rights to a vaccine candidate from our ally germany; cut cdc and state department programs for early identification of infectious pathogens; withdrew funding and support for the world health organization (who); and tried to distract from his dereliction of duty by drawing from the authoritarian playbook he so admires —using racist rhetoric to blame “outsiders” and stoke divisions at home. democrats will take the opposite tack by restoring american leadership, driving a coordinated global health and economic response to the covid- pandemic, and ensuring that we’re far better prepared for future global health emergencies. building a stronger, fairer economy the economy is not working for the american people. in a matter of weeks, the abject failure of president trump and his administration to competently respond to the covid- pandemic erased all the job gains made since the obama-biden administration pulled the country out of the great recession, and plunged the economy into recession once more. president trump inherited the longest economic expansion in american history from the obama-biden administration, and he squandered it. even before the covid- pandemic, president trump was presiding over a recession in the manufacturing sector, after years of growth in the obama-biden administration. he had the audacity to pay for a permanent tax cut for big business by raising taxes on working families. he launched a reckless trade war with china that cost more than , american jobs and sent farmers into bankruptcy, decimating the american heartland. he has left our communities vulnerable and exposed to the impacts of climate change, let other countries outpace us in the clean energy revolution america should be leading , and completely failed to fulfill his campaign promise to the american people to invest in rebuilding and modernizing our nation’s crumbling infrastructure. but our economy was rigged against working families and the middle class even before the novel coronavirus sickened millions and killed more than , americans and counting. working families’ incomes have been largely stagnant for decades, while the cost of basic needs—from housing to health care, higher education to child care—keep rising at precipitous rates. meanwhile, the rich have been capturing a larger and larger share of the economic pie, with incomes for the top one percent growing five times faster than those of the bottom percent. america bills itself as the land of opportunity, but intergenerational mobility has plummeted; children born in the united states are less likely to move up the income ladder than those in canada, denmark, or the united kingdom. women still earn just cents to every dollar men earn, with even greater disparities for women of color. median incomes are lower and poverty rates are higher for black americans, latinos, native americans, and certain asian american and pacific islander communities, compared to median white households. and there is a persistent, pernicious racial wealth gap that holds millions of americans back, with the typical white household holding six times more wealth than the typical latino family and times more wealth than the typical black family. president trump’s recession threatens to deepen existing inequities, as black and latino workers are less likely to work in jobs that can be done safely from home, less likely to have savings to fall back on, and less likely to be able to access unemployment insurance and other emergency programs electronically. that’s bad for our economy, bad for our democracy , and bad for the soul of our nation. that is why democrats commit to forging a new social and economic contract with the american people— a contract that invests in the people and promotes shared prosperity , not one that benefits only big corporations and the wealthiest few. one that affirms housing is a right and not a privilege, and which makes a commitment that no one will be homeless or go hungry in the richest country on earth. a new economic contract that raises wages and restores workers’ rights to organize, join a union, and collectively bargain. one that at last supports working families and the middle class by securing equal pay for women and paid family leave for all. a new economic contract that provides access for all to reliable and affordable banking and financial services. a new social and economic contract that at last grapples honestly with america’s long and ongoing history of racism and disenfranchisement, of segregation and discrimination, and invests instead in building equity and mobility for the people of color who have been left out and left behind for generations. democrats stand ready to take immediate, decisive action to pull the economy out of president trump’s recession by investing in infrastructure , care work, clean energy, and small businesses to put americans to work in good-paying jobs ; shoring up state and local budgets to save jobs and protect public health in the ongoing covid- pandemic; and enacting fundamental reforms to address structural and systemic racism and entrenched income and wealth inequality in our economy and our banking system. protecting workers and families and creating millions of jobs across america americans deserve an economy that works for everyone—not just for the wealthy and the well-connected. but our system has been rigged against the american people. democrats believe that it is a moral and an economic imperative that we support working families by rebuilding the american middle class for the 21st century, making sure this time that everyone can make it and thrive, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, national origin, age, or zip code. raising wages and promoting workers’ rights democrats will fight to raise wages for working people and improve job quality and security, including by raising the federal minimum wage so it reaches $ an hour by . raising the federal minimum wage, so fewer workers are forced to hold down multiple jobs to make ends meet, will significantly decrease risks of infection from covid- and in the future. we know that strong american labor unions help increase wages and job standards for workers across the economy, which is why democrats will prioritize passing the pro act and restoring workers’ rights, including the right to launch secondary boycotts. we will repeal so-called “right to work” laws that undermine worker power and lead to lower wages and less protection for workers across the economy, and ensure those who have been left without wage and hour protections for decades—including domestic workers and farmworkers—have the same rights as other workers. democrats will support legislation to strengthen whistleblower and anti-retaliation protections for workers who speak for themselves or their coworkers. and we will take action to rein in anti-competitive corporate power by rewriting the rules that have undermined workers’ ability to advocate for themselves, including non-compete clauses, no-poaching agreements, and contracts that force workers into mandatory arbitration to resolve violations of employment laws. democrats will recognize unions with majority sign-up—via “card check” processes— and ban captive audience meetings, which employers use to bully and browbeat workers. we will hold executives personally accountable if they interfere in workers’ efforts to organize, including issuing criminal penalties for intentional obstruction. we will take action to guarantee that when workers come to the table, they are able to bargain with the employers who actually hold the power, including franchisors, and penalize companies that bargain in bad faith with their workers. democrats will vigorously protect all private-sector workers’ right to strike without fear of coercion, interference, and undue delay. we will also establish the federal government's role in promoting and facilitating collective bargaining and helping the parties bring their negotiations to a rapid and successful conclusion, committing to a high standard for intervening in strikes, including under the railway labor act. the right of workers to come together and form a union is under attack. we must unrig the rules that block workers from having the union they want and update our labor laws to make it more possible. we must change labor law so that it is easier for unions and employers to enter into multi-employer agreements establishing minimum workplace standards related to wages, benefits, and working conditions. democrats believe taxpayer dollars should never flow to employers who steal workers’ wages, violate labor laws, engage in union-busting, or exploit immigrant workers to depress working conditions for all workers. we will increase funding and staffing at the department of labor to aggressively enforce wage, hour, health, and safety rules across the economy. democrats believe employees who are being misclassified, including gig and platform workers, deserve wage and workplace protections including minimum wage and overtime pay, and we support using the abc test to determine employee status. democrats believe that all workers should be able to hold their employers accountable for unpaid or underpaid wages, regardless of corporate structure. we support using grants and collaborative relationships with community organizations to ensure that workers know their rights and responsibilities under the law. democrats will strengthen labor rights for the more than million public-sector employees in the united states by passing the public service freedom to negotiate act, which would provide a federal guarantee for public-sector employees to bargain for better pay and benefits and the working conditions they deserve. we cannot hope to raise wages without taking on the profound racial biases at work in our employment system. the wage gap between black workers and white workers is higher today than it was years ago. it takes a typical black woman months to earn what a typical white man earns in months—and for typical latinas and native american women, it takes almost two years. democrats believe we need to be much more proactive and aggressive in rooting out discrimination in our employment system. we will increase funding to the equal employment opportunity commission and increase its authority to initiate directed investigations into civil rights violations, violations of the rights of people with disabilities, and violations against lgbtq+ people, especially transgender women of color. federal contractors should be required to develop and disclose plans to recruit and promote people of color, women, lgbtq+ people, people with disabilities, and veterans —and be held accountable for delivering. enacting robust work-family policies the united states is alone among advanced economies in guaranteeing neither paid sick leave nor paid family leave for all workers. this puts excessive burdens on working families, and especially working mothers, even in the best of times, and is catastrophic for public health in the midst of the covid- pandemic. democrats will implement paid sick days and a high-quality, comprehensive, and inclusive paid family and medical leave system that protects workers from the unfair choice between attending to urgent health or caretaking needs and earning a paycheck. we will fight to ensure workers are guaranteed at least weeks of paid family and medical leave for all workers and family units, to enable new parents to recover from childbirth and bond with their newborns, foster or adopted children, and allow all workers to take extended time off to care for themselves or ailing loved ones.. finding and paying for high-quality child care is an emotional, logistical, and financial tightrope for too many parents, and that needs to change. working parents shouldn’t have to choose between keeping their kids safe and earning a paycheck. democrats will make major investments in quality, affordable child care, including by significantly increasing the child and dependent care tax credit and providing access to affordable, high-quality child care on a sliding scale by boosting funding for grants to states to help low-income and middle-class families afford child care. we will improve compensation and benefits for child care providers and enact universal, high-quality pre-k programs for three- and four-year-olds. we will also invest in expanding long-term services and supports and home and community-based care for seniors and people with disabilities. democrats will increase wages and benefits for paid caregivers in all settings, which will improve working conditions and quality of care while enabling family members to rejoin the workforce. investing in the engines of job creation democrats believe the covid- pandemic, and president trump’s recession, demand unprecedented, transformational federal investments to create family-sustaining and union jobs. we believe that the world’s richest nation should have the world’s best infrastructure system. that’s why we will invest in resilient, sustainable, and inclusive infrastructure. democrats will launch a clean energy revolution through historic investments in clean energy, clean transportation, energy efficiency, and advanced manufacturing. we will repair, modernize, and expand our highways, roads, bridges, and airports, including by installing , public charging stations for electric vehicles , ensuring our passenger transportation systems are resilient to the impacts of climate change, and using safe, modern design approaches that allow drivers, pedestrians, cyclists, and others to safely share the road. we will launch our country’s second great railroad revolution by investing in high-speed rail and passenger and freight rail systems, and commit to public transportation as a public good , including ensuring transit jobs are good jobs. this railroad revolution will reduce pollution, connect workers to good union jobs , slash commute times, and spur investment in rural communities that will now be better linked to major metropolitan areas. democrats will invest to ensure passenger transportation, including public transit, is affordable to all and accessible to people with disabilities. we will help transform amtrak from a laggard to a leader in passenger rail accessibility and ensure people with disabilities can receive compensation when disability equipment, like wheelchairs, are lost or damaged by transportation carriers. democrats will upgrade our nation’s ports, lock and dam systems, and freight infrastructure to accommodate 21st century cargo, reduce air and water pollution , and create and maintain high-quality, good-paying jobs. we will increase demand for american-made ships by ensuring u.s. cargo is carried on ships flying our flag. we will make sure that every community in america has access to clean, reliable drinking water and safe wastewater systems in their homes, including by replacing dangerous lead pipes. we will increase investment in innovative water technologies, including water use efficiency, water conservation, and water reuse and recycling, that reduce water waste and consumer bills. we will modernize and green our public schools, and ensure they are accessible to students with disabilities. and democrats will close the digital divide that deprives more than million americans of high-speed internet access by investing in broadband and 5g technology, including rural and municipal broadband, while ensuring those investments support good jobs and include strong protections for workers’ rights to organize, and restoring the fcc’s authority to take strong enforcement action against internet service providers who violate net neutrality principles. democrats support the creation of an infrastructure bank, a public bank that will leverage public and private resources to build infrastructure projects of national or regional significance, including in rail and transit, clean energy and water infrastructure, broadband , and affordable housing. projects that receive assistance from the bank will be required to follow buy america and buy clean provisions, pay davis-bacon prevailing wages, utilize project labor agreements, and ensure employers remain neutral in workers’ organizing efforts. all federally supported infrastructure projects, whether existing or newly developed, financed through grants, loans, tax incentives, or a national infrastructure bank, should create good, union jobs that expand the middle class. that is why democrats will ensure labor protections, davis-bacon wage standards, project labor agreements, collective bargaining neutrality, and domestic sourcing requirements are included in any infrastructure legislation, and will block anti-worker provisions, including forced arbitration. as we expand the clean energy technology and infrastructure industry; we will fight to enact legislation that will drive the creation of family sustaining jobs, with the high road labor standards with the provisions defined in the good jobs for the 21st century energy act. democrats support transparent, accountable, and sound management of publicly owned infrastructure and assets, and will ensure that local jurisdictions are adequately protected from partisan power grabs seeking to strip them of those assets. we will ensure robust federal oversight of any proposed transfers of ownership or operations, and will oppose any policy that promotes the privatization of public services or infrastructure. democrats believe more products in our homes, stores, workplaces, and communities should be stamped “made in america” and will expand support for american manufacturing. we will end policies that incentivize offshoring, and instead accelerate onshoring of critical supply chains , including in medical supplies and pharmaceuticals. we will expand effective tax credits that support domestic manufacturing and grow rural manufacturing jobs through investments in bio-based manufacturing. we will invest in innovation hubs and government programs to provide small manufacturers with technical and business expertise so they can grow their revenues and their workforces. democrats support robust buy america and buy clean standards for federally supported projects, which help increase demand for domestically produced and low-pollution raw materials. to ensure all workers can access the good jobs that will be created and supported by these investments and build a diverse pipeline of talent across the economy, democrats will invest in career and technical education and high-quality job training programs with formal worker representation in program development, including pre-apprenticeship opportunities and registered apprenticeships . we believe in the value of lifelong learning, and will increase investments to support adult literacy and other skills development programs. democrats know that small businesses are among the best job creators in our country. we will significantly boost funding for state small business grant and lending initiatives that generate tens of billions of dollars of private-sector investment, especially for small businesses owned by women and people of color. we will increase access to credit for small businesses in low-income and rural areas, including for unbanked or underbanked businesses. and we will increase funding for programs supporting businesses owned by women and people of color, including ending the trump administration’s effort to starve the minority business development agency, improving and expanding small business administration (sba) programs that most effectively support women- and minority-owned businesses, and increasing opportunities for women- and minority-owned businesses to obtain or participate in federal contracts. democrats will invest in the american heartland and rural communities. we will make it easier for new and beginning farmers, aquaculture farmers, ranchers, and foresters, including returning veterans, to start and grow their operations by expanding u.s. department of agriculture (usda) ownership and operating loan programs. recognizing the history of racial discrimination in usda’s core farming programs, democrats will continue the reform efforts started under the obama-biden administration to ensure usda takes a more proactive approach to supporting training and resources for farmers of color. we will protect family farms and promote food security, including by taking steps to limit foreign ownership of u.s. farmland and reforming agricultural subsidies to better support small- and mid-sized farms. democrats believe farmers should have the right to repair their own farming equipment, rather than being forced to rely on large corporations for even the simplest fixes. and we will expand domestic markets for family farmers and ranchers by developing and growing regional food systems to deliver fresh, american-grown produce to schools, hospitals, department of defense installations, and other major public institutions, so small, mid-size, and traditional farmers can stay competitive. democrats will partner with america’s farmers, ranchers, and foresters to make the u.s. agriculture sector the first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions, which will spark a revolution in agriculture and open up new revenue streams for farmers in energy and waste products , and grow bio-based manufacturing jobs. we will grow the nation’s biofuels manufacturing sector, including by strengthening the renewable fuel standard, supporting e15 blends , and supporting research, development, and deployment of advanced biofuels. we will expand popular, voluntary programs for sustainable and regenerative agricultural practices that help protect clean air and water and support wildlife habitats, including for threatened pollinators. democrats will invest in research and development to support climate-resilient, sustainable, low-carbon, and organic agricultural methods. america’s farmworkers are essential to our economy, our communities, and our security. we will enforce labor and environmental protections for farmworkers, including overtime and safety rules protecting workers from exposure to pesticides and extreme heat, and ensure farmworkers are able to exercise their right to bargain collectively. democrats will empower small and mid-size family farms by tackling market concentration in agriculture, including by strengthening enforcement of the sherman and clayton antitrust acts and the packers and stockyards act. we will also review federal guidelines to improve workers safety at facilities that raise and process meat for consumption, and use the federal government’s procurement power to incentivize the humane treatment of farm animals in accordance with commercially-recognized animal welfare standards. the united states has long been a world leader in science, technology, research, and innovation. democrats oppose the trump administration’s efforts to undermine federal scientific research institutions, apply political screens to research grants, and interfere with the work of career scientists—actions which have a chilling effect on scientific discovery and are damaging to america’s economic competitiveness. democrats will support historic federal investments in research, development, demonstration, and deployment, which will break new frontiers of science and create jobs across the country in aerospace, artificial intelligence, advanced materials, biotechnology, and clean energy and clean vehicles. democrats support public investments in technology and innovation that help create a stronger economy for all americans. we will support women innovators and innovators of color, encourage diversity in technology, and promote business models that reinvest in low-income communities and communities of color. democrats continue to support the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa) and are committed to continuing space exploration and discovery. we believe in continuing the spirit of discovery that has animated nasa’s human space exploration, in addition to its scientific and medical research, technological innovation, and educational mission that allows us to better understand our own planet and place in the universe. we will strengthen support for the united states' role in space through our continued presence on the international space station, working in partnership with the international community to continue scientific and medical innovation. we support nasa's work to return americans to the moon and go beyond to mars, taking the next step in exploring our solar system. democrats additionally support strengthening nasa and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration’s earth observation missions to better understand how climate change is impacting our home planet. building a fair system of international trade for our workers for too long, the global trading system has failed to keep its promises to american workers. too many corporations have rushed to outsource jobs, and too many countries have broken their promises to be honest and transparent partners. the covid- pandemic has shown the risks of relying too heavily on global supply chains, as shutdowns and shortages have created chaos for workers and consumers and made our public health response even more challenging. the trump administration has failed time after time to deliver for american workers on this crucial issue, siding with corporate interests over our workers and launching a trade war with china that they have no plan for winning —creating incredible hardship for american farmers, manufacturers, workers, and consumers in the process. democrats will pursue a trade policy that puts workers first. we will negotiate strong and enforceable standards for labor, human rights, and the environment in the core text of our trade deals. future trade agreements should build on the pro-labor provisions added to the united states-mexico-canada agreement (usmca) by democratic members of congress. democrats will take aggressive action against china or any other country that tries to undercut american manufacturing by manipulating their currencies and maintaining a misaligned exchange rate with the dollar, dumping products like steel and aluminum in our markets , or providing unfair subsidies. unlike president trump, we will stand up to efforts from china and other state actors to steal america’s intellectual property and will demand china and other countries cease and desist from conducting cyberespionage against our companies. we will eliminate president trump’s tax and trade policies that encourage big corporations to ship jobs overseas and evade paying their fair share of taxes. if companies shut down their operations here and outsource jobs, we’ll claw back any public investments or benefits they received from taxpayers. and we will take immediate action to repair the damage president trump’s reckless policies have done to american farmers, by working with our allies to stand up to china and negotiate from the strongest possible position. putting homeownership in reach and guaranteeing safe housing for every american homeownership is at the center of the american dream —and yet it has never been in reach for all. decades of red-lining, rising income inequality, and predatory lending practices targeting low-income families and people of color have made homeownership all but impossible for millions of working families. homeownership has long been central to building generational wealth, and expanding access to homeownership to those who have been unfairly excluded and discriminated against is critical to closing the racial wealth gap. we have a nationwide shortage of affordable housing units, and tens of millions of americans live in homes that pose risks to their health and safety. homelessness has reached crisis proportions in a growing number of states, and housing costs that rise faster than wages have put the squeeze on renters in many of our biggest cities. housing in america should be stable, accessible, safe, healthy, energy efficient, and, above all, affordable. no one should have to spend more than percent of their income on housing, so families have ample resources left to meet their other needs and save for retirement. democrats believe the government should take aggressive steps to increase the supply of housing, especially affordable housing, and address long-standing economic and racial inequities in our housing markets. we support innovative approaches to eliminating the racial wealth gap in america. rehabilitating housing and expansion of housing owned by land trusts will increase the amount of housing available for secure homeownership. we will equalize access to affordable credit and improve access to down payment assistance to help families of color, low-income families, and rural buyers purchase homes. we will increase funding for assistance to first-time purchasers and homeowners to navigate the financing and servicing of their homes. we will create a new tax credit of up to $, to help first-time homebuyers, and will make the tax credit refundable and advanceable, so buyers can get assistance at the time of purchase, instead of having to wait until they file their taxes. democrats will supercharge investment in the housing trust fund to greatly expand the number of affordable, accessible housing units on the market. we will expand the low-income housing tax credit to incentivize private-sector construction of affordable housing, and make sure urban, suburban, and rural areas all benefit. we will make energy efficiency upgrades for millions of low-income households, affordable housing units, and public housing units in metropolitan and rural areas to save families money on their energy bills and provide safe and healthy homes. and democrats will leverage existing programs, including at usda, to build more affordable, accessible housing and retrofit existing housing in rural areas. we will ensure all federally supported housing projects, from new builds to retrofits, include mandatory requirements for labor standards, accessibility, and civil rights protections. democrats are committed to ending homelessness in america. democrats commit to providing section housing support for every eligible family, and will enact protections to keep landlords from discriminating against voucher recipients. we will increase investments in public housing to expand availability for the first time since the 1990s, and improve and upgrade existing public housing to ensure safe living conditions for residents , protecting tenants’ rights to return if extensive renovations are needed. democrats support a housing-first approach to ending homelessness, because having a stable and safe place to live is essential to helping a person tackle any other challenges they may face, from mental illness to substance use disorders to post-traumatic stress disorder. we will act swiftly to end homelessness among veterans and will enact strong protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer youth, especially black, latino, and native american lgbtq+ youth, who too often find themselves on the streets. democrats will enact a new homeowner and renter bill of rights to protect families from abusive lenders and landlords. we will empower renters by working to establish a national tenant right to organize, and support outreach and education to help tenants advocate to preserve and expand affordable housing. and democrats will provide legal support to fight wrongful evictions. america’s history of using public policy and private lending restrictions to close neighborhoods off to black families and other people of color and strip equity from their communities is long, painful, and unresolved to this day. the trump administration has made matters worse by gutting fair lending and fair housing protections for homeowners. democrats will vigorously enforce the fair housing act, the home mortgage disclosure act , the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule, and the disparate impact standard, and hold lenders accountable for discriminatory practices. we will also ensure that federal housing programs are better designed to affirmatively further fair housing. we will use the federal government to enforce settlements against discriminatory lenders, and require communities to proactively review housing patterns and remedy local policies that have a discriminatory effect. we will work to ensure that residential property and mortgage ownership records are publicly available and easily accessible, so that homeowners can always know who services their mortgage and who truly owns their debt. democrats will give local elected officials tools and resources to combat gentrification, penalize predatory lending practices, and maintain homeownership, including exploring targeted rental relief when exorbitant rent increases force long-term residents from their communities and tackling persistent racial bias in appraisals that contributes to the racial wealth gap. leveling the economic playing field the u.s. economy is rigged against the american people. time after time, president trump and the republicans have rewarded big corporations and their wealthy donors, and left working families behind. democrats will take decisive action to level the playing field for people of color, working families, women, small business owners, and others who have been left on the sidelines. reforming the tax code to benefit working families our tax system has been rigged against the american people by big corporations and their lobbyists, and by republican politicians who dole out tax cuts to their biggest donors while leaving working families to struggle. democrats will take action to reverse the trump administration’s tax cuts benefiting the wealthiest americans and rewarding corporations for shipping american jobs overseas. we will crack down on overseas tax havens and close loopholes that are exploited by the wealthiest americans and biggest corporations. we will make sure the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes. we will make sure investors pay the same tax rates as workers and bring an end to expensive and unproductive tax loopholes, including the carried interest loophole. corporate tax rates, which were cut sharply by the republican tax cut, must be raised, and “trickle-down” tax cuts must be rejected. estate taxes should also be raised back to the historical norm. democrats will reform the tax code to be more progressive and equitable, and reduce barriers for working families to benefit from targeted tax breaks, including the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit. our program of reform will provide immediate, marked relief for working families, including more generous, refundable tax credits to benefit low- and middle-income families, and easier and more equitable access to tax provisions that help working families build wealth, including by equalizing tax benefits for retirement contributions and providing more accessible tax breaks for homeownership. curbing wall street abuses the scars of the financial crisis that triggered the great recession are still present in our economy and our society. financial institutions should never be “too big to fail.” democrats will work to reverse the over-financialization of the american economy and curb wall street speculation by maintaining and expanding safeguards that separate retail banking institutions from more risky investment operations, and ensuring wall street investors pay their fair share in taxes. we will strengthen and enforce the obama-biden administration’s dodd-frank financial reform law, including the volcker rule, to protect american workers from the impacts of future financial crises, and will support an updated and modernized version of glass-steagall. and when justified by the law, we will back criminal penalties for reckless executives who illegally gamble with the savings and economic security of their clients and american communities. democrats will expand access to credit by creating a public credit reporting agency to provide a non-discriminatory credit reporting alternative to the private agencies, and will require its use by all federal lending programs, including home lending and student loans. and we will strengthen banking regulations, including the community reinvestment act, to ensure equitable access to credit and banking products for all americans, and reinvigorate the consumer financial protection bureau (cfpb) to ensure that banks, financial institutions, and lenders cannot prey on consumers. we commit to revisit and repeal sections of existing bankruptcy law that frequently lead to debtors losing their home as the result of medical debt, divorce, job loss, or just bad luck. we will also give bankruptcy judges the authority to ""cram down,"" or modify, mortgages for primary residences during bankruptcy proceedings, so working families can benefit from the same debt relief tools currently available to those who own assets like vacation homes and yachts. ending poverty democrats remain committed to ending poverty and enabling all americans to live up to their god-given potential. we recognize that the official poverty rate, as measured and communicated by the federal government, fails to capture critical needs like housing, education, health care, transportation, energy, and other necessities, and therefore understates the true share of americans living in poverty. we will support the -- funding approach, to direct at least percent of federal funding to communities where percent or more of the population has been living below the poverty line for years or longer. directing more federal investment to the communities most in need will help create jobs; improve and expand housing; modernize and expand transportation, clean water, wastewater, energy, and broadband infrastructure; and promote shared prosperity. we will raise the minimum wage to $ an hour and guarantee equal pay for women, two measures that in combination will pull millions of families out of poverty. we will make it easier for working families to benefit from targeted tax breaks, including the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, which too often go unclaimed by the lowest-income tax filers. we will significantly expand affordable housing and build new public housing for the first time since the 1990s, and guarantee section benefits to all who qualify —all of which will help reduce housing costs and increase housing availability for low-income families. democrats believe health care is a human right. we will incentivize states to expand medicaid and enroll low-income people who do not otherwise have health insurance in a new, high-quality public option without premiums. we will double investments in community health centers and rural health centers, and expand mobile health units, to make it easier for low-income people to access health care. in the wealthiest country on earth, it is a moral abomination that any child could ever go to bed hungry. democrats will increase funding for food assistance programs, including snap, wic, and school meals. we will also remove barriers that keep the formerly incarcerated from accessing food assistance. cuts to the legal services corporation have imperiled access to justice in civil court for low-income defendants and litigants alike in matters concerning access to public benefits and housing, eviction proceedings, and custodial cases. democrats will significantly increase investment in the legal services corporation to ensure those who cannot afford private representation can nevertheless equitably access the civil justice system and have their day in court. democrats will provide substantially higher levels of support for programs and institutions that boost economic development in america’s most impoverished communities, including by doubling funding for cdfis, expanding the community development block grant, increasing the number of rural business investment companies, and expanding and making permanent the new markets tax credit. one in four american households are either unbanked or underbanked, putting them at risk of losing money due to exorbitant fees or usurious interest rates. democrats will support and encourage efforts in congress to guarantee affordable, transparent, and trustworthy banking services that are language-accessible for low- and middle-income families, including bank accounts and real-time payment systems through the federal reserve and easily accessible service locations, like postal banking. protecting consumer rights and privacy consumers, workers, students, retirees, and investors who have been mistreated by businesses should never be denied their right to fight for fair treatment under the law. democrats will support efforts to eliminate the use of forced arbitration clauses in employment and service contracts, which unfairly strip consumers, workers, students, retirees, and investors of their right to their day in court. in the 21st century—and especially in the covid- pandemic—it is all but impossible for consumers, students, workers, and people with disabilities to opt out of using the internet to shop, socialize, learn, work, bank, and live. democrats are committed to policies that will protect individuals’ privacy and data rights while continuing to support and enable innovation and improve accessibility in the technology sector. we will update the consumer privacy bill of rights proposed by the obama-biden administration, including adding strong national standards to protect consumers, employees, patients, and students from data breaches, and work with congress to pass it into law. democrats will take additional steps to protect student data privacy, particularly in preschool and k- settings where most students are under , and ensure that data collected in schools is used only for education, not for commercial purposes. and we support updating the electronic communications privacy act, which has not been significantly amended since the 1980s, to afford the same protections to digital content as physical content. tackling runaway corporate concentration democrats are concerned that the increase in corporate concentration across a wide range of industries, from hospitals and pharmaceutical companies to agribusiness and retail chains, could be stifling competition and innovation and creating monopoly conditions that harm consumers. we will direct federal regulators to review a subset of the mergers and acquisitions that have taken place since president trump took office, prioritizing the pharmaceutical, health care, telecommunications, technology, and agricultural industries, to assess whether any have increased market concentration, raised consumer prices, demonstrably harmed workers, increased racial inequality, reduced competition, or constricted innovation, and assign appropriate remedies. democrats will direct regulators to consider potential effects of future mergers on the labor market, on low-income and marginalized communities, and on racial equity, as well as on consumer prices and market competition. and as a last resort, regulators should consider breaking up corporations if they find they are using their market power to engage in anti-competitive activities. guaranteeing a secure and dignified retirement democrats are proud to be the party that advocates retirement security for all. we are the party that created and strengthened social security, and defended public and private retirement plans that provide a decent monthly income. and we are fighting to make sure that all workers have the ability to save at work for emergencies and for retirement. social security is the most enduring thread in our nation’s social safety net. we will enact policies to make social security more progressive, including increasing benefits for all beneficiaries, meaningfully increasing minimum benefit payments, increasing benefits for long-duration beneficiaries, and protecting surviving spouses from benefit cuts. we will eliminate provisions that unfairly reduce public sector workers’ earned social security benefits. in light of weakened retirement security for unpaid caregivers and caregivers for family members, who sacrifice not only wages but social security benefits when they swap paid labor for unpaid care work, democrats support social security reform which better accounts for the challenges facing unpaid caregivers— including incremental reforms to the benefit formula to mitigate the penalty for unpaid care. democrats will reject every effort to cut, privatize, or weaken social security, including attempts to raise the retirement age, diminish benefits by cutting cost-of-living adjustments, or reduce earned benefits. we will ensure social security will be there forever. democrats will protect americans’ retirement security, especially in the midst of the covid- pandemic, and take action to protect public and private pensions to ensure workers keep the benefits they have earned, including through multiemployer plans. democrats oppose changes to the multiemployer pension system that would endanger workers’ and retirees’ pensions, including composite pension plans. we support amending federal bankruptcy laws to protect workers’ earned pensions from being taken away by employers going through bankruptcy. we will also make it easier to save for retirement beyond social security. we will support approaches to retirement saving that enable workers and retirees to prepare for and prosper in retirement, including reforms that will allow states and municipalities to create public individual and pooled retirement account options that are easy for workers to access and understand. we will advocate federal legislation to make it easy for all workers to save, not just those in states or municipalities that have established their own programs. democrats believe that when workers are saving for retirement, the financial advisors they consult should be legally obligated to put their client's best interests first. we will take immediate action to reverse the trump administration's regulations allowing financial advisors to prioritize their self-interest over their clients' financial wellbeing. and democrats will equalize the network of retirement savings tax breaks so that working people can build their nest eggs faster, while also providing more equitable access to these accounts through automatic enrollment and relaxed contribution restrictions for unpaid caregivers. achieving universal, affordable, quality health care democrats have fought to achieve universal health care for a century. we are proud to be the party of medicare, medicaid, and the affordable care act. because of the obama-biden administration and the affordable care act, more than million americans with pre-existing conditions, from heart disease to asthma, are secure in the knowledge that insurance companies can no longer discriminate against them. women can no longer be charged more than men just because of their gender. and more americans are able to get health coverage than ever before. democrats will keep up the fight until all americans can access secure, affordable, high-quality health insurance —because as democrats, we fundamentally believe health care is a right for all, not a privilege for the few. unfortunately, at every turn, democrats’ efforts to guarantee health coverage have been met by obstruction and opposition from the republican party. it has been republicans who have embraced junk plans that undermine protections for pre-existing conditions. it was republican state attorneys general who sued to block medicaid expansion and republican governors who refused to extend medicaid coverage to their citizens, leaving millions of low-income americans, disproportionately people of color, unable to access health coverage. and in the midst of the worst global pandemic in generations—one that has left more than , americans dead and counting—the trump administration is fighting in court to invalidate the entirety of the affordable care act and eliminate insurance for tens of millions of people. overturning the affordable care act remains a central plank of the republican party platform. the difference in values between the two parties on this life-or-death issue could not be more stark. the covid- pandemic has made this difference in values painfully, brutally clear. president trump has repeatedly downplayed the threat of the coronavirus, bullied governors for enacting life-saving public health measures, and left our frontline health care heroes without the equipment they need to protect themselves and the american people. the burdens of this pandemic have not been borne equally, as communities of color have suffered higher rates of infection and death, and struggled to access life-saving care when they need it most. our essential workers have been deemed expendable by the president and his administration. as democrats, we say with one voice: no more. we are going to at last build the health care system the american people have always deserved: one that finally provides universal health care coverage; reduces prescription drug prices, premiums, and out-of-pocket costs ; reins in overall health care expenses; and tackles the deep-seated inequities in our health care system. we will build a health care system that is driven by the needs of patients and the people who care for them, instead of the profit motives of corporations. we will tackle entrenched racial disparities in health care, reduce prescription drug prices by standing up to big pharmaceutical companies , and make it easier to access mental health and substance use disorder treatment and long-term services and supports in metropolitan and rural areas alike. democrats will always fight to save americans’ lives by making it easier and more affordable to go to the doctor, get prescription medicines, and access preventive testing and treatments. generations of democrats have been united in the fight for universal health care. we are proud our party welcomes advocates who want to build on and strengthen the affordable care act and those who support a medicare for all approach; all are critical to ensuring that health care is a human right. securing universal health care through a public option democrats believe we need to protect, strengthen, and build upon our bedrock health care programs, including the affordable care act, medicare, medicaid, and the veterans affairs (va) system. private insurers need real competition to ensure they have incentive to provide affordable, quality coverage to every american. to achieve that objective, we will give all americans the choice to select a high-quality, affordable public option through the affordable care act marketplace. the public option will provide at least one plan choice without deductibles; will be administered by cms, not private companies; and will cover all primary care without any co-payments and control costs for other treatments by negotiating prices with doctors and hospitals, just like medicare does on behalf of older people. everyone will be eligible to choose the public option or another affordable care act marketplace plan. to help close the persistent racial gap in insurance rates, democrats will expand funding for affordable care act outreach and enrollment programs, so every american knows their options for securing quality, affordable coverage. the lowest-income americans, including more than four million adults who should be eligible for medicaid but who live in states where republican governors have refused to expand the program, will be automatically enrolled in the public option without premiums; they may opt out at any time. and we will enable millions of older workers to choose between their employer-provided plans, the public option, or enrolling in medicare when they turn , instead of having to wait until they are . democrats are categorically opposed to raising the medicare retirement age. democrats will also empower the states, as laboratories of democracy, to use affordable care act innovation waivers to develop locally tailored approaches to health coverage, including by removing barriers to states that seek to experiment with statewide universal health care approaches. we also know that finally covering every american through the public and private insurance system alone is not enough to guarantee universal access. that is why democrats support doubling investments in community health centers and rural health clinics in underserved urban and rural areas, including increased support for dental care, mental health care, and substance use services like medication-assisted treatment, and why we will increase support for mobile health clinics. we will enact longer, multi-year funding cycles for these critical health services so they can operate with greater certainty, as community health centers are the nation’s only providers that are required by law to be both located in medically underserved areas and required to serve all who seek care, regardless of their ability to pay. and we will leverage innovative payment options through medicare and medicaid to help community health centers and rural health clinics keep their doors open. we will expand the national health service corps and teaching health center graduate medical education program to grow a diverse primary care workforce and to address critical shortages of health care providers in medically underserved rural and urban areas, including primary care nurses, dental professionals, and mental health and substance use counselors. democrats will also increase monitoring and enforcement to ensure that health care facilities are accessible to people with disabilities. bringing down drug prices and taking on the pharmaceutical industry too many americans struggle to afford the prescription drugs they need to get or stay healthy. no american should find themselves foregoing or rationing medications because they can’t afford to pay— especially when taxpayer money underwrites research leading to the development of many prescription drugs in the first place. democrats will take aggressive action to ensure that americans do not pay more for prescription drugs than people in other advanced economies, and ensure that all necessary medications are covered. we will empower medicare to at last be able to negotiate prescription drug prices for all public and private purchasers—for families and businesses, as well as older americans—no matter where they get their coverage. we will also prevent the price of brand-name and outlier generic drugs from rising faster than the inflation rate. we will cap out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors, and ensure that effective treatments for chronic health conditions are available at little or no cost. for too long, prescription drug companies have gamed the system to justify their price increases by any means available. democrats will crack down on anti-competitive efforts to manipulate the patent system or collude on prices. and we will eliminate tax breaks for prescription drug advertisements. reducing health care costs and improving health care quality the united states spends more per capita on health care than any other advanced economy, and has less to show for it. health care costs have been increasing for decades, with average premiums for an employer-provided family plan topping $, in . democrats know we can reduce out-of-pocket costs for families while improving the quality of health care for all. we will make it easier for working families to afford high-quality insurance in the affordable care act marketplaces by ensuring that no one pays more than . percent of their income in premiums and eliminating the cap on subsidies. democrats believe that when americans are in the hospital or an emergency room, they shouldn’t have to worry about whether their health care providers are in-network or not, which is why we will outlaw the predatory practice of surprise medical billing. we will work to increase price transparency in the health care system across all payers, and reduce paperwork through uniform medical billing. and we will vigorously use antitrust laws to fight against mega-mergers in the hospital, insurance, and pharmaceutical industries that would raise prices for patients by undermining market competition. excessive prescription drug cost-sharing and voids in coverage such as dental, vision, and hearing services can lead to severe health consequences for medicare patients. democrats will fight any efforts to cut medicare benefits, and support finding financially sustainable policies to expand medicare to cover dental, vision, and hearing. democrats will support policies that increase the number of primary care practitioners, registered nurses, dentists, and dental therapists, especially in rural and low-income metropolitan areas, so it’s easier for every american to access preventive and primary health care. democrats value all people and will actively promote wellness programs for all ages in our diverse communities for better overall health. expanding access to mental health and substance use treatment every american who needs it should be able to access mental health care or substance use disorder treatment, no matter where they live. democrats will aggressively enforce the federal mental health and substance use disorder parity law and ensure that health insurers adequately cover mental health and substance use treatment. we will also invest in training and hiring more mental health providers, substance use disorder counselors, and peer support counselors, including by expanding funding for health clinics, especially in rural areas, and increasing access to these services through medicaid. trauma has a profound effect on both mental and physical health, and democrats will support increased training for health care professionals, educators, social workers, and other care workers in trauma-informed care and practices. we will oppose efforts to weaken hipaa and ferpa privacy rights of people with mental illness. the opioid epidemic has devastated american communities, and the trump administration has completely failed in its response, leaving millions of families desperate for help. democrats will make medication-assisted treatment available to all who need it, and will require publicly supported health clinics to offer medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction and approved treatments for other substance use disorders. we believe we must stop over-prescribing while improving access to effective and needed pain management. democrats recognize that incarcerated people suffer from serious mental health and substance use disorders at higher rates than the general population, which is why we will support expanded access to mental health and substance use disorder care in prisons and for returning citizens. we will ensure no one is incarcerated solely for drug use, and support increased use of drug courts, harm reduction interventions, and treatment diversion programs for those struggling with substance use disorders. expanding long-term care services and supports the covid- pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of people who reside in institutional settings, such as nursing homes and independent living facilities, and made clear that biases within medicaid create undue barriers to home- and community-based long-term services and supports. democrats will work to eliminate waiting lists for home and community-based care and the institutional bias within medicaid, making investments in building the capacity of the medicaid system to provide home and community-based services. we will modernize medicaid eligibility so people with disabilities do not have to work low-wage jobs to access needed services, and to ensure the spouses of people with disabilities can maintain a certain level of income and assets. we will also help americans pay for long-term care by creating a tax credit for informal and family caregivers and increasing the child and dependent care tax credit. democrats will also pursue policies to improve nursing home staffing and quality standards, strengthen accreditation processes, and combat corporate abuses in nursing homes and independent living facilities. and democrats are strongly committed to protecting and enforcing the americans with disabilities act and fulfilling the promise of the olmstead v. l.c. decision, which found institutional segregation of people with disabilities to be unlawful. eliminate racial, gender, and geographic health inequities the national statistics on american health care mask profound disparities in insurance rates, access to primary and specialized care, and disparate health outcomes, which are a symptom of those disparities in access. even before the covid- pandemic, the uninsured rate was nearly three times higher for latinos and nearly twice as high for black americans as it was for whites. some segments of the asian american and pacific islander population faced uninsured rates rivaling those of black americans and latinos, and more than one in five native americans and alaska natives was uninsured. black children are far more likely than white children to suffer from asthma. latinos, native americans, asian americans and pacific islanders, and black americans are diagnosed with diabetes at higher rates than whites. and average life expectancy is more than two years lower for rural americans compared to those who live in metropolitan areas. we recognize it is not enough to have a commitment to eliminating health disparities: we must have a plan. that is why democrats will launch a sustained, government-wide effort, with leadership at the highest levels, to eliminate racial, ethnic, gender, and geographic gaps in insurance rates, access to quality care, and health outcomes. that includes tackling the social, economic, and environmental inequities—the social determinants of health like poor housing, hunger, inadequate transportation, mass incarceration, air and water pollution, and gun violence— that contribute to worse health outcomes for low-income americans and people of color. we can and must fix these inequities by expanding coverage, making health care more affordable, and tackling implicit bias in our health care system. democrats will ensure that people with disabilities are never denied coverage based on the use of quality-adjusted life year (qaly) indexes. democrats will ensure federal data collection and analysis is adequately funded and designed to allow for disaggregation by race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, geography, disability status, national origin, and other important variables, so that disparities in health coverage, access, and outcomes can be better understood and addressed. we will expand access to health care for people living and working across the united states by extending affordable care act coverage to dreamers, and working with congress to lift the five-year waiting period for medicaid and children’s health insurance program eligibility for low-income, lawfully present immigrants. democrats remain committed to ending the hiv/aids epidemic, which disproportionately affects communities of color and the lgbtq+ community, and will support critical investments under the ryan white hiv/aids program and the minority hiv/aids fund. protecting native american health native american tribes have for too long been forced to cope with insufficient access to health care and mental health services, nutrition services, and modern infrastructure. democrats are committed to pursuing environmental justice and climate justice, including for indigenous peoples and communities, and will invest significant new resources in clean water and wastewater infrastructure, clean energy generation and distribution, and sustainable and regenerative agriculture. and we will make mandatory and work toward full funding for the indian health service as part of our commitment to pursuing strong nation-to-nation relationships and honoring the united states’ trust obligations to native american communities. securing reproductive health, rights, and justice democrats are committed to protecting and advancing reproductive health, rights, and justice. we believe unequivocally, like the majority of americans, that every woman should be able to access high-quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion. we will repeal the title x domestic gag rule and restore federal funding for planned parenthood, which provides vital preventive and reproductive health care for millions of people, especially low-income people, and people of color, and lgbtq+ people, including in underserved areas. democrats oppose and will fight to overturn federal and state laws that create barriers to reproductive health and rights. we will repeal the hyde amendment, and protect and codify the right to reproductive freedom. we condemn acts of violence, harassment, and intimidation of reproductive health providers, patients, and staff. we will address the discrimination and barriers that inhibit meaningful access to reproductive health care services, including those based on gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, income, disability, geography, and other factors. democrats oppose restrictions on medication abortion care that are inconsistent with the most recent medical and scientific evidence and that do not protect public health. we recognize that quality, affordable comprehensive health care; medically accurate, lgbtq+ inclusive, age-appropriate sex education; and the full range of family planning services are all essential to ensuring that people can decide if, when, and how to start a family. we are proud to be the party of the affordable care act, which prohibits discrimination in health care on the basis of sex and requires insurers to cover prescription contraceptives at no cost. these efforts have significantly reduced teen and unintended pregnancies by making it easier to decide whether, when, and how to have a child. we believe that a person's health should always come first. democrats will protect the rights of all people to make personal health care decisions, and will reject the trump administration’s use of broad exemptions to allow medical providers, employers, and others to discriminate. protecting and promoting maternal health black women are more than three times as likely to die from complications of pregnancy and childbirth compared to white women. to save mothers’ lives, democrats will expand postpartum medicaid coverage to a full year after giving birth, invest in rural maternal health, promote a diverse perinatal workforce, and implement implicit bias training for health professionals. we will support comprehensive solutions to address every dimension of the black maternal health crisis in america and eliminate all racial and ethnic disparities in maternal health outcomes, and support policies and approaches that will at least halve our nation’s unacceptably high maternal mortality rate. we strongly and unequivocally support the decision to have a child, including by ensuring a safe and healthy pregnancy and childbirth, and by providing services during pregnancy and after the birth of a child, including adoption and social support services, as well as protections against pregnancy discrimination. we are committed to creating a society where children are safe and can thrive physically, emotionally, educationally, and spiritually. protecting lgbtq+ health we condemn the trump administration’s discriminatory actions against the lgbtq+ community, including the dangerous and unethical regulations allowing doctors, hospitals, and insurance companies to discriminate against patients based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. democrats will reverse this rulemaking and restore nondiscrimination protections for lgbtq+ people and people living with hiv/aids in health insurance, including coverage of all medically necessary care for gender transition. we will also take action to guarantee that lgbtq+ people and those living with hiv/aids have full access to needed health care and resources, including by requiring that federal health plans provide coverage for hiv/aids testing and treatment and hiv prevention medications like prep and pep, gender confirmation surgery, and hormone therapy. democrats support increased community hiv prevention and testing programs which target latino, black, asian american and pacific islander, native american, and other at-risk communities to address the increases of hiv. democrats will recommit the federal government to ending the hiv/aids epidemic by . democrats are proud that the obama-biden administration lifted the discriminatory lifetime ban on blood donation by healthy gay and bisexual americans. we will work to ensure blood donation regulations are based on science, not fiction or stigma and that no american, when seeking to donate blood, will face more stringent limitations than any other simply because of who they are. strengthening and supporting the health care workforce the covid- pandemic has made plain to people across the country that our health care workers are heroes. our doctors and nurses, our home health aides and physician’s assistants, our public health professionals, our home care workers and nursing home workers, and our cleaners and service workers have shown up to work every day despite dire shortages of personal protective equipment. far too many of them have lost their lives to this terrible disease, and untold thousands are suffering the mental and emotional strain of losing far too many patients. and yet, despite the critical role they play in our society and our economy, these frontline workers—a majority of whom are women of color—are often underpaid and lack access to paid sick days, paid family and medical leave, health insurance, and other benefits critical for their own health and the health of patients. democrats believe that all jobs in the caring economy must come with family-sustaining wages, good benefits, access to paid leave, fair and predictable schedules, access to training and professional development, and the ability to join a union and collectively bargain. we believe all employers funded by taxpayer dollars must pay their workers at least $ an hour and protect workers’ rights to organize. although health care jobs are among the fastest growing in the economy, demand for services still far outstrips supply, especially in primary care. we will invest in community health worker care-forces around the nation proven to prevent, manage, and better treat chronic illnesses, and empower first-time mothers with home visiting. we will close provider gaps and increase diversity in the health care profession by creating a robust pipeline of talent with career ladders for advancement. and we will also increase opportunities for community health workers to come from the communities they serve. investing in health science and research scientific research is at the heart of medicine—and of health care. democrats want the united states to be at the forefront of scientific research and discovery for the benefit of our people, our economy, and our global competitiveness. we will support increased and sustainable funding for health and medical research and federal grants across agencies, including at the national cancer institute and other components of the national institutes of health (nih), the cdc, and the agency for health care research and quality. we will increase the federal investment in research and development for new medications through the nih, and make sure that there is a return on that investment for taxpayers. we will also build on the foundation of the obama-biden administration’s cancer moonshot to break down silos and accelerate research into cancer and cancer treatments by creating an agency with the sole mission of finding new cures and treatments for cancer and other diseases. democrats also support increasing funding for research into health disparities by race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, geographic area, and socioeconomic status, with a particular focus on how the social determinants of health contribute to differences in health outcomes. we support fully integrating people with disabilities in all stages of health and medical research to ensure outcomes reflect the true needs of americans with disabilities. democrats will take steps to increase the diversity of principal investigators receiving federal grants, as well as of participants in federally supported clinical trials, to improve the quality and applicability of our medical research for women and people of color, who are too often left out of research on disease and medical responses to treatment options. the trump administration’s systematic efforts to undermine, discredit, dismiss, fire, disempower, and diminish the contributions of scientists, in health science and other disciplines, have weakened our public institutions, slowed the pace of scientific inquiry, and profoundly damaged america’s standing in the world. democrats will protect the independence and intellectual freedom of scientists, whether they are employed by the federal government or receiving federal grants in support of their research, and take steps to shield our scientific research agencies from future political interference. protecting communities and building trust by reforming our criminal justice system our criminal justice system is failing to keep communities safe—and failing to deliver justice. america is the land of the free, and yet more of our people are behind bars, per capita, than anywhere else in the world. instead of making evidence-based investments in education, jobs, health care, and housing that are proven to keep communities safe and prevent crime from occurring in the first place, our system has criminalized poverty, overpoliced and underserved black and latino communities, and cut public services. instead of offering the incarcerated the opportunity to turn their lives around, our prisons are overcrowded and continue to rely on inhumane methods of punishment. instead of treating those who have served their time as full citizens upon their return to society, too many of our laws continue to punish the formerly incarcerated, erecting barriers to housing, employment, and voting rights for millions of americans. democrats believe we need to overhaul the criminal justice system from top to bottom. police brutality is a stain on the soul of our nation. it is unacceptable that millions of people in our country have good reason to fear they may lose their lives in a routine traffic stop, or while standing on a street corner, or while playing with a toy in a public park. it is unacceptable that black parents must have “the talk” with their children, to try to protect them from the very police officers who are supposed to be sworn to protect and serve them. it is unacceptable that more than , people, a quarter of them black, have been killed by police every year since . democrats also recognize that all too often, systematic cuts to public services have left police officers on the front lines of responding to social challenges for which they have not been trained, from homelessness to mental health crises to the opioid epidemic. we can and must do better for our communities. democrats know we can end the era of mass incarceration and dramatically reduce the number of americans held in jails and prisons while continuing to reduce crime rates, which have fallen steadily from their peak nearly three decades ago. this is the moment to root out structural and systemic racism in our criminal justice system and our society, and reimagine public safety for the benefit of our people and the character of our country. we must start by preventing people from entering the criminal justice system in the first place. democrats believe we must break the school-to-prison pipeline that too often relies on arrests and law enforcement to address misbehavior that ought to be handled and deescalated within the school.. we support re-issuing federal guidance from the department of education and the department of justice to prevent the disparate disciplinary treatment of children of color and children with disabilities in school and educational settings. democrats believe every school should have sufficient funding to employ guidance counselors, social workers, nurses, or school psychologists to help guarantee age-appropriate and racially equitable student disciplinary practices, rather than turning to police to resolve these issues. a growing number of states have recognized it is unjust—and unjustifiable—to punish children and teenagers as harshly as adults. we believe that if you aren’t old enough to drink, you aren’t old enough to be sentenced to life without parole. the federal government will incentivize states to stop incarcerating kids, and develop community-based alternatives to prison and detention centers for youth and invest in after-school programs, community centers, and summer jobs to provide opportunities for young people at risk. and democrats believe that children who do enter the juvenile justice system should be given a true second chance, including by automatically sealing and expunging juvenile records. democrats believe we must ensure real accountability for individual and systemic misconduct in our police departments, prevent law enforcement from becoming unnecessarily entangled in the everyday lives of americans, and reimagine policing for the benefit and safety of the american people. in recent years, some innovative police departments have enacted evidence-based reforms to change their approach by investing in robust training and putting in place—and, even more crucially, enforcing—strong standards governing conflict resolution, de-escalation, and use of force. we must build on these evidence-based approaches and implement them nationwide. democrats will establish strict national standards governing the use of force, including banning the use of chokeholds and carotid holds and permitting deadly force only when necessary and a last resort to prevent an imminent threat to life. americans must feel safe when they are asleep in their own homes. we will work to establish “no-knock warrants” standards. the risk of mistakes and unintended consequences is too great. we will require immediate application of these standards to all federal law enforcement agencies and condition federal grants on their adoption at the state and local level. we will require officer training in effective nonviolent tactics, appropriate use of force, implicit bias, and peer intervention, both at the academy and on the job. and we will ban racial and religious profiling in law enforcement. democrats will support measures to improve training and education for judges, corrections officers, prosecutors, public defenders, and police officers to ensure transgender and gender non-conforming people receive fair and equitable treatment in the criminal justice system. it is past time to end the failed “war on drugs,” which has imprisoned millions of americans —disproportionately black people and latinos— and hasn’t been effective in reducing drug use. democrats support policies that will reorient our public safety approach toward prevention, and away from over-policing —including by making evidence-based investments in jobs, housing, education, and the arts that will make our nation fairer, freer, and more prosperous. democrats will reinvigorate community policing approaches, so officers on the beat better serve the neighborhoods they work in, and make smart investments to incentivize departments to build effective partnerships with social workers and mental health and substance use counselors to help respond to public health challenges. body cameras are not a panacea, but democrats believe they can help improve accountability and transparency; we support their continued use and will take steps to improve compliance, require their use in blended federal-local task forces, and promulgate best practices to protect personal privacy. democrats believe weapons of war have no place on our streets, and will once again limit the sale and transfer of surplus military weapons to domestic law enforcement agencies —a policy president trump reversed immediately upon taking office. we cannot create trust without holding those in power accountable for their actions. democrats will reinvigorate pattern-or-practice investigations into police misconduct at the department of justice, and strengthen them through new subpoena powers and expanded oversight to address systemic misconduct by prosecutors. far too often, the law has shielded police officers who stand accused of heinous violations of civil and human rights. democrats support lowering the intent standard for federally prosecuting law enforcement officials for civil rights violations. we will also act to ensure that victims of federal, state, or local law enforcement abuses of power can seek justice through civil litigation by reining in the doctrine of qualified immunity. the american people deserve access to timely and accurate data on activities supported by their tax dollars, including policing. we will collect and publish data on the use of force in police departments across the country to promote transparency and accountability. to increase transparency and improve federal, state, and local law enforcement hiring practices, democrats will also establish a national registry of officers who have been found to have abused their power. democrats also support measures to increase diversity among the ranks of police departments, so our law enforcement agencies look more like the communities they serve. and we will seek increased funding for officer health and well-being in police departments across the country, including for personal safety equipment and mental health services. substance use disorders are diseases, not crimes. democrats believe no one should be in prison solely because they use drugs. democrats will decriminalize marijuana use and reschedule it through executive action on the federal level. we will support legalization of medical marijuana, and believe states should be able to make their own decisions about recreational use. the justice department should not launch federal prosecutions of conduct that is legal at the state level. all past criminal convictions for cannabis use should be automatically expunged. and rather than involving the criminal justice system, democrats support increased use of drug courts, harm reduction interventions, and treatment diversion programs for those struggling with substance use disorders. poverty is not a crime, and it should not be treated as one. democrats support eliminating the use of cash bail and believe no one should be imprisoned merely for failing to pay fines or fees, or have their driver's licenses revoked for unpaid tickets or simple violations. equal justice under the law should not be contingent on the ability to pay for quality legal representation, which is why we support increasing funding for public defenders and for the legal services corporation. since , the united states has grown by one-third, the number of cases in federal district courts has increased by percent, federal circuit court filings have risen by percent, and federal cases involving a felony defendant are up percent, but we have not expanded the federal judiciary to reflect this reality in nearly years. democrats will commit to creating new federal district and circuit judgeships consistent with recommendations from the judicial conference. sentencing decisions should be based on the facts of each case, including the severity of the offense and individuals’ circumstances. democrats support allowing judges to determine appropriate sentences, which is why we will fight to repeal federal mandatory minimums, incentivize states to do the same, and make all sentencing reductions retroactive so judges can reconsider past cases where their hands were tied. we believe it is long past time to end the federal sentencing disparity between crack and powdered cocaine, which has contributed to the disproportionate imprisonment of people of color. and democrats continue to support abolishing the death penalty. our courts should reflect our country. democrats will appoint people to the bench who are committed to seeing justice be served, and treating each case on its merits. we will nominate and confirm federal judges who have diverse backgrounds and experiences, including as public defenders, legal aid attorneys, and civil rights lawyers. democrats are proud that the obama-biden administration commuted the sentences of more than , people serving unjust sentences following thorough review of their individual cases, and we support the continued use of the president’s clemency powers to secure the release of those serving unduly long sentences. we denounce president trump’s inappropriate use of clemency to help his friends and political cronies avoid justice. we also support establishing an independent clemency board to ensure an appropriate, effective process for using clemency, especially to address systemic racism and other priorities. private profit should not motivate the provision of vital public services, including in the criminal justice system. democrats support ending the use of private prisons and private detention centers, and will take steps to eliminate profiteering from diversion programs, commercial bail, electronic monitoring, prison commissaries, and reentry and treatment programs. democrats believe prisoners should have a meaningful opportunity to challenge wrongful convictions and unconstitutional conditions in prisons. we also believe that too many of our jails and prisons subject people to inhumane treatment, and will work to end practices like solitary confinement for adults and juveniles, ban the use of restraints on pregnant federal inmates, and ban the use of chokeholds and carotid holds. incarcerated people must not be denied access to vital medical care or unnecessarily exposed to disease, as they have been during the covid- pandemic. and democrats will pursue a holistic approach to rehabilitation, increasing support for programs that provide educational opportunities, including pursuing college degrees, for those in the criminal justice system, both in prison and upon release. democrats believe in redemption. we must deepen our commitment to helping those who have served their time re-enter society, earn a good living, and participate in our democracy as the full citizens they are. we support the automatic expungement of certain criminal records for those that have been fully acquitted, wrongfully convicted, or pardoned by the executive. we will aim to ensure access to transitional housing for returning citizens, support expanded access to mental health and substance use treatment, and will stop the practice of reincarcerating people for technical violations of probation or parole. democrats support federal and state efforts to “ban the box” and will make it easier for returning citizens to access work opportunities through the job corps. the formerly incarcerated should not be blocked from exercising their voting rights or accessing public services, including pell grants and nutrition assistance, available to other free citizens of the united states. continuing to punish a person after they have rejoined the community is both cruel and counterproductive. healing the soul of america democrats believe in bringing the american people together, not stoking division and distrust. president trump has denigrated virtually every segment of american society —and in so doing, he has insulted the very idea of america itself. healing the soul of america means facing up to the deepest inequities in our society, from structural racism to misogyny to discrimination against people with disabilities, and enacting ambitious measures to fix them. protecting americans’ civil rights democrats are committed to ending discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, language, gender, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability status. we will appoint u.s. supreme court justices and federal judges who look like america, are committed to the rule of law, will uphold individual civil rights and civil liberties as essential components of a free and democratic society, and will respect and enforce foundational precedents, including brown v. board of education and roe v. wade . democrats are committed to restoring the full power of the voting rights act and ensuring every citizen can access the ballot box. we will enforce and strengthen the matthew shepard and james byrd, jr. hate crimes prevention act, and will end racial and religious profiling in law enforcement. president trump’s words and actions have given safe harbor and encouragement to racists, anti-semites, anti-muslim bigots, and white supremacists. it’s time to root out domestic terrorism in all its forms. we will use federal law enforcement tools and resources to address domestic terrorism, and if necessary work with congress to pass a domestic terrorism law that is consistent with the constitutional right to free speech and civil liberties. achieving racial justice and equity historic wrongs and abuses perpetrated against native americans, two and a half centuries of slavery, a hundred years of jim crow segregation, and a history of exclusionary immigration policies have created profound and lasting inequities in income, wealth, education, employment, housing, environmental quality, and health care for communities of color. democrats are committed to standing up to racism and bigotry in our laws, in our culture, in our politics, and in our society, and recognize that race-neutral policies are not sufficient to rectify race-based disparities. we will take a comprehensive approach to embed racial justice in every element of our governing agenda, including in jobs and job creation, workforce and economic development, small business and entrepreneurship, eliminating poverty and closing the racial wealth gap, promoting asset building and homeownership, education, health care, criminal justice reform, environmental justice, and voting rights. democrats will ensure federal data collection and analysis is adequately funded and designed to allow for disaggregation by race and ethnicity, among other important factors, to better design policies to address the needs of the most vulnerable communities and make informed policy choices. hate and its symbols have no home in america. democrats believe that we can only build a more just and equitable future if we honestly reckon with our history and its legacy in the present. we support removing the confederate battle flag and statues of confederate leaders from public properties. we recognize black history has too often been intentionally suppressed or excluded from our history books, and will invest in recovering, celebrating, and highlighting black history as american history. democrats believe juneteenth (june 19th) represents the end of slavery, the freedom for millions of enslaved black americans, and should be recognized as a federal holiday. we believe black lives matter, and will establish a national commission to examine the lasting economic effects of slavery, jim crow segregation, and racially discriminatory federal policies on income, wealth, educational, health, and employment outcomes; to pursue truth and promote racial healing; and to study reparations. we must acknowledge that there can be no realization of the american dream without grappling with the lasting effects of slavery, and facing up to the centuries-long campaign of violence, fear, and trauma wrought upon black americans. the extreme gap in household wealth and income between people of color—especially black americans, latinos, native americans, and certain asian american and pacific islander communities—and white families is hurting our working class and holding our country back. democrats are committed to improving economic mobility for people of color. we will fight to tackle intergenerational poverty and close the racial wealth gap. democrats support policies to end discrimination and unfair practices in the housing market, will empower local governments to combat gentrification trends that disproportionately harm long-time residents of color, and will create a community restoration fund to repair the toxic legacy of historic investments in transportation that were designed to enforce racial segregation. we will equalize access to credit and expand support for first-time homebuyers to make homeownership and the wealth-building it creates more accessible for people of color. democrats recognize that racial wealth gaps are rooted in longstanding discrimination and unjust policies. we will equalize established pathways for building wealth while exploring innovative approaches to closing racial wealth gaps, including policies that provide seed capital in order to access the economic security of asset ownership. the right to organize and collectively bargain benefits all workers, but especially for workers of color. unions close pay gaps between white workers and people of color. the union wage premium is high for all workers, but remains especially substantial for people of color, including latinos and black workers. this is one reason why black workers represent a higher share of the labor movement than the workforce as a whole. unemployment rates for people of color are persistently higher than the national average, which is why democrats support making racial equity part of the mandate of the federal reserve. specifically, we will work with congress to direct the chair of the federal reserve to report on the extent of racial employment and wage gaps, and how the central bank is countering them, in addition to monitoring, reporting on, and responding to macroeconomic conditions in general. we will invest in low-income communities, urban and rural areas, and communities of color by strengthening the community reinvestment act, improving federal support and access to credit for women- and minority-owned small businesses, expanding and making permanent the new markets tax credit, and doubling funding for cdfis. we will restore and build on the obama-biden administration’s fair pay and safe workplaces policy, and use the purchasing power of the federal government to incentivize private companies to recruit and advance people of color, women, people with disabilities, and veterans. democrats believe it is unacceptable that schools are more segregated today than they were in the late 1960s. we believe education is a critical public good, and will increase investments to guarantee all students can access high-quality public schools, no matter where they live, so students of color are well prepared to thrive in college and careers. we will break the school-to-prison pipeline that sees children of color disproportionately punished by the criminal justice system for disciplinary issues that should be handled by school administrators or counselors. the covid- pandemic, which has disproportionately sickened and killed black americans, latinos, native americans, and certain asian american and pacific islander communities, has made long-standing racial and geographic disparities in health care and health outcomes into front-page news. democrats will launch an all-of-government effort to eliminate health disparities, including by achieving universal health coverage through a high-quality, affordable public option; expanding funding for community health centers, rural health centers, and mobile health clinics; and tackling environmental racism that sees communities of color disproportionately impacted by air pollution, water pollution, and toxic chemicals. all people in the united states should be able to easily access public services, and all citizens should be able to exercise their constitutional right to vote without facing unjust or discriminatory barriers. democrats will restore the full powers of the voting rights act and go further to roll back discriminatory policies that have been put in place in recent years to prevent people of color from voting. we will ensure all federal agencies produce materials in languages commonly spoken in the united states, including languages spoken by asian american and pacific islander communities, and that voting materials are also easily accessible for citizens with limited english proficiency. protecting women’s rights democrats will fight to guarantee equal rights for women, including by ratifying the equal rights amendment and at long last enshrining gender equality in the u.s. constitution. we will take aggressive action to end pay inequality, including by increasing penalties against companies that discriminate against women and passing the paycheck fairness act. democrats are committed to ending sexual assault, domestic abuse, and other violence against women, including the epidemics of violence against native american women and transgender women of color. like the majority of americans, democrats believe every woman should be able to access high-quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion. we oppose and will fight to overturn federal and state laws that create barriers to women’s reproductive health and rights, including by repealing the hyde amendment and protecting and codifying the right to reproductive freedom. and democrats will take action to protect the rights of pregnant women in the workplace, including by requiring employers to make reasonable accommodations for pregnant and breastfeeding workers and those who have recently given birth and at last joining other advanced economies by enacting paid sick days and universal paid family and medical leave. protecting lgbtq+ rights democrats applaud this year’s u.s. supreme court decision that made clear that employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity violates the law, but we know we still have work to do to ensure lgbtq+ people are treated equally under the law and in our society. we will fight to enact the equality act and at last outlaw discrimination against lgbtq+ people in housing, public accommodations, access to credit, education, jury service, and federal programs. we will work to ensure lgbtq+ people are not discriminated against when seeking to adopt or foster children, protect lgbtq+ children from bullying and assault, and guarantee transgender students’ access to facilities based on their gender identity. democrats will ensure federally funded programs for older adults are inclusive for lgbtq+ seniors. recognizing that lgbtq+ youth and adults suffer from significant health disparities, including mental health and substance use disorders, democrats will expand mental health and suicide prevention services, and ban harmful “conversion therapy” practices. we will ensure that all transgender and non-binary people can procure official government identification documents that accurately reflect their gender identity. we will stop employment discrimination in the federal government, and will restore full implementation of president obama’s executive order prohibiting discrimination by federal contractors on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. democrats are committed to ending the homelessness crisis, including among lgbtq+ youth. we will fight to end violence against transgender americans and particularly against black transgender women, who are disproportionately victims of assault and homicide , and will prioritize the investigation of hate crimes against transgender and non-binary people. protecting disability rights one in four american adults live with a disability. democrats believe people with disabilities deserve to lead full, happy, and healthy lives. democrats will fully enforce the americans with disabilities act, the individuals with disabilities education act, the fair housing act, the civil rights of institutionalized persons act, section of the rehabilitation act, the mental health parity and addiction equity act, and the help america vote act, among other bedrock statutes protecting the rights of people with disabilities. we will oppose any efforts to weaken enforcement of the americans with disabilities act. we will ensure non-discrimination in access to health care, building on the protections for people with disabilities enshrined in the affordable care act. we will ensure every federal agency aggressively enforces the integration mandate affirmed in the olmstead decision, and repair the damage done by the trump administration. we will rigorously enforce non-discrimination protections for people with disabilities in health care, employment, education, and housing, and ensure equal access to the ballot box. democrats are committed to supporting the millions of americans on the autism spectrum and their families. we will expand early childhood screening, particularly in underserved communities, and promote equitable treatment of students on the autism spectrum in schools and educational settings, in keeping with our commitment to providing equal educational opportunities for students with disabilities. by eliminating state waiting lists for home and community-based care, ending the institutional bias in medicaid, and expanding support for informal caregivers, democrats will enable more individuals with autism to receive the support they need in their homes and communities. democrats will phase out the subminimum wage, expand competitive, integrated employment opportunities, and protect and strengthen economic security for people with disabilities. we will take a holistic approach to the supplemental security income (ssi) and social security disability insurance (ssdi) programs that are essential for millions of americans with disabilities by increasing ssi benefits, eliminating waiting periods for ssdi, and eliminating the “benefit cliff” for ssdi benefits. we will increase federal funding to expand accessible transportation and accessible, integrated, and affordable housing. we will protect people with disabilities in emergencies and meet the needs of travelers with disabilities. we will ensure new technologies benefit, and are affordable and accessible for, people with disabilities. we will expand access to tax-advantaged able savings accounts, which provide people with disabilities a way to pay for disability-related expenses like housing, education, and transportation. and democrats will improve access to home- and community-based care for people with disabilities and older americans, including by enforcing the medicaid home and community-based settings rule, ending the institutional bias within medicaid, and expanding the home care workforce to end state waiting lists for long-term services and supports. honoring indigenous tribal nations the u.s. government has a profound legal and moral obligation toward native american tribes and indigenous communities— a trust which has been broken time and again, undermining tribal nations’ ability to flourish politically, culturally, and economically. democrats are committed to honoring, upholding, and strengthening the united states’ trust obligations to tribal nations and communities, as enshrined in the constitution, treaties, federal statutes, and case law. democrats recognize and support the sovereignty of tribal nations and pledge to work on a nation-to-nation basis to empower indigenous peoples, increase economic development in tribal nations, and protect tribal lands, assets, resources, and treaty rights. we honor and support the great indigenous traditions all across the country. we stand with the mashpee wampanoag tribe and all tribal nations in rejecting the trump administration’s efforts to remove land that had been put into trust by the obama-biden administration. we will fight to enact a clean carcieri fix and support policies to restore tribal lands, including culturally significant federal lands, by moving land into trust, streamlining the land-into-trust process, and conducting land buy-backs. we will also support establishment of additional federal co-management agreements with tribal nations on federal lands that have cultural and historical significance to tribes. democrats believe the federal government must commit to providing full funding to fulfill unmet trust and treaty obligations to tribal nations and native american peoples. we will work on a nation-to-nation basis to increase funding, resources, and financial tools for tribes, particularly in the key areas of criminal justice, health care, education, housing, and economic development. democrats will work to address the predictability of funding for tribes, and explore pathways including mandatory funding, advanced appropriations, shutdown exemptions, and other mechanisms. the covid- pandemic has devastated indian country, with some tribal communities facing among the highest per capita infection rates in the country. as part of our commitment to fighting the covid- pandemic, democrats will support funding to hire sufficient staff to conduct contact tracing for all who test positive for this deadly disease. we will surge funding to the indian health service and support investments to help tribal governments address the economic fallout of the covid- pandemic and president trump’s recession, including investments to support and create jobs in tribal communities and to support affordable child care, so parents are not forced to choose between keeping their jobs and keeping their children safe. democrats recognize the security of native peoples (american indians, alaska natives, and native hawaiians) is paramount, and will ensure that they have the resources they need to investigate and prosecute crimes against native peoples and communities, including cooperation from law enforcement agencies outside tribal lands. we will fight for justice for missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. democrats will at last reauthorize the violence against women act, reaffirm provisions relating to tribal jurisdiction, and expand the list of crimes that can be prosecuted under the statute to include stalking, child abuse, and trafficking. we also support indian tribal jurisdiction over tribal lands, and we support further efforts to address the oliphant decision. we will defend the indian child welfare act and protect native families and involve tribes in child welfare cases. and we will build on federal programs to reduce the disproportionate incarceration of american indian, alaska native, and native hawaiian men and women, reduce sentencing disparities, and work to ensure all returning citizens have access to housing, employment services, and health care, including mental health and substance use disorder treatment. american indians, alaska natives, and native hawaiians are uninsured at higher rates and suffer from disparities in health outcomes, including in the covid- pandemic. democrats will make mandatory and work toward full funding for the indian health service and the native hawaiian health care improvement act to help expand access to health care for native people, including mental health, dental care, and substance use disorder treatments, and will fully fund contract support costs. we will expand insurance coverage for native americans (including american indians, alaska natives, and native hawaiians) no matter where they live by creating a high-quality, affordable public option on the affordable care act exchanges, and making the public option available without premiums to low-income families. the legacy of native american boarding schools has caused generational trauma. we acknowledge this injustice and support continued education and restorative justice. we will invest in indian education from early childhood through college and career education. democrats will significantly expand funding for the bureau of indian education and invest in improving public school buildings. we will increase resources for programs that promote cultural preservation and enable native students to learn their indigenous languages, and support national curricula to teach native american history and culture in schools. democrats will increase recruitment of high-quality teachers and school professionals in tribal areas. and we will break down barriers that keep native american students from accessing a college education, including by making community colleges free and significantly increasing support to lower attendance costs at tribal colleges and universities (tcus). democrats are committed to reestablishing and strengthening the white house generation indigenous initiative and its annual white house tribal youth gathering to support native youth. we are committed to combating hurtful and racist native american stereotypes in mainstream american culture, especially those associated with sports teams and educational institutions. democrats will substantially increase investments to meet tribal housing needs, including by constructing and upgrading affordable housing on tribal lands, investing in drinking and clean water infrastructure, and investing in rural and tribal broadband infrastructure. we will make energy-saving upgrades to millions of low-income homes and affordable and public housing units, and increase funding for the indian community development block grant program. we will unlock significant new resources for economic development on tribal lands, including supporting investments in clean energy, climate change resilience, and 21st century infrastructure projects. we will expand access to capital for tribes by increasing resources for the native american cdfi assistance program, expanding and making permanent the new markets tax credit, and expanding technical assistance to enable tribes to better access existing federal funding streams. we will continue to support and expand sba programs for tribes and fully implement the buy indian act. we will also support tribal governments and their authority to tax activities on their lands in support of tribal self-sufficiency and government services. democrats are committed to environmental justice for indian country, and will work to ensure all people have clean air, clean water, modern wastewater infrastructure, and can live without exposure to toxic chemicals. democrats recognize that the native american men and women who have proudly served in the armed forces of the united states in all its wars, from the beginning of u.s. history, deserve the total and unqualified support of their needs by the federal government. we will ensure that all the benefits provided to u.s. military veterans are provided to native veterans and fully funded to meet the special cultural needs of native veterans. democrats will additionally establish a veterans affairs tribal advisory committee to foster improved collaboration and coordination between the federal government and tribal nations on meeting the unique needs of native american veterans, and establish tribal veteran service delivery programs in tribal communities. democrats commit to managing federal actions and undertakings in a manner that honors the trust responsibility; respects the nation-to-nation relationship and sovereignty of tribes; and protects subsistence, treaty, and other reserved rights, natural and cultural resources, and sacred sites of federally-recognized indian tribes. we commit to upholding leasing and rights-of-way regulations that strengthen tribal sovereignty and ensure tribal consent on lands in which tribes hold an interest. we will create a more robust and meaningful consultation process that is consistent across all federal agencies, including the office of management and budget, and use early and ongoing consultation to identify and work to appropriately mitigate or address concerns. democrats recognize that self-governance and self-determination empowers tribes to prioritize their needs and plan for the future consistent with their distinct traditions, economies, and institutions. recognizing the success many tribes have had with self-governance, we will work to make it more effective within the bureau of indian affairs and encourage other federal agencies to negotiate such agreements with tribes. consistent with the policies of the obama-biden administration, democrats will make permanent the white house council on native american affairs and commit to holding an annual white house tribal nations conference. we will nominate federal judges who understand indian law, and will ensure native americans and alaska natives are appointed to high-level and leadership positions within the federal government. over percent of native americans live off-reservation. democrats will create a strategy to support urban indian populations and ensure their voices are heard and no one is left behind, including by expanding support to access quality health care, culturally relevant education, affordable housing, and other programs. democrats also support efforts for self-governance and self-determination of native hawaiians. native hawaiians are the indigenous, aboriginal people of hawai’i whose values and culture are the foundation of the hawaiian islands. we support proactive actions by the federal government to enhance native hawaiian culture, housing, health, language, and education. we recognize and honor the contributions and sacrifices made in service to our country by native hawaiians. ending violence against women democrats are committed to ending sexual assault, domestic abuse, and other violence against women. we will act swiftly to overcome republican obstructionism and reauthorize and expand the violence against women act to better protect native american women, women with disabilities, children and young women, transgender women and other lgbtq+ people, and other groups who are disproportionately affected by sexual assault and domestic abuse. democrats will expand services for survivors of violence against women, including by expanding access to housing, legal assistance, and victim advocate services. we will support danger assessment and lethality training for law enforcement officers and community partners to help curb domestic violence homicides. we recognize that sex workers, who are disproportionately women of color and transgender women, face especially high rates of sexual assault and violence, and we will work with states and localities to protect the lives of sex workers. we will enforce and provide tools and resources for schools to implement title ix, which requires schools and institutions of higher education to properly investigate sexual misconduct, including peer-on-peer sexual harassment and violence; take appropriate action; and prevent future sexual misconduct. democrats will increase resources to eliminate the national backlog of untested rape kits so that more survivors can see justice be served. and we will support federal and state legislative efforts to make “revenge porn” and other unauthorized disclosures of intimate images a civil and criminal offense. ending the epidemic of gun violence gun violence is a public health crisis in the united states. over , people are shot and nearly , people die annually from guns—devastating countless families, friends, and communities. we can and will make gun violence a thing of the past. addressing the gun violence crisis requires supporting evidence-based programs that prevent gun deaths from occurring in the first place, including by making mental health care more accessible and supporting suicide reduction initiatives, funding interventions to reduce homicides and gun violence in neighborhoods, and strengthening protections against domestic violence. democrats will also ensure the centers for disease control and prevention have sufficient resources to study gun violence as a public health issue, including the ongoing health care, mental health, economic, and social costs that can affect survivors and their families for years. democrats will enact universal background checks, end online sales of guns and ammunition, close dangerous loopholes that currently allow stalkers, abusive partners, and some individuals convicted of assault or battery to buy and possess firearms, and adequately fund the federal background check system. we will close the “charleston loophole” and prevent individuals who have been convicted of hate crimes from possessing firearms. democrats will ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high capacity magazines. we will incentivize states to enact licensing requirements for owning firearms and extreme risk protection order laws that allow courts to temporarily remove guns from the possession of those who are a danger to themselves or others. we will pass legislation requiring that guns be safely stored in homes. and democrats believe that gun companies should be held responsible for their products, just like any other business, and will prioritize repealing the law that shields gun manufacturers from civil liability. supporting faith and service religious freedom is a core american value and a core value of the democratic party. democrats will protect the rights of each american for the free exercise of his or her own religion. it will be the policy of the democratic administration to advocate for religious freedom throughout the world. democrats celebrate america’s history of religious pluralism and tolerance, and recognize the countless acts of service of our faith communities, as well as the paramount importance of maintaining the separation between church and state enshrined in our constitution. during the trump administration, too many of our religious communities have been victimized by acts of intolerance, bigotry, and violence. we will reject the trump administration’s use of broad religious exemptions to allow businesses, medical providers, social service agencies, and others to discriminate. democrats will increase funding and support for security investments and protection at houses of worship, because everyone should be able to pray without fear. we will confront white nationalist terrorism and combat hate crimes perpetrated against religious minorities. democrats also recognize that, to fully confront the legacy of systemic and structural racism, it is time to examine, confront and dismantle the government programs, policies and practices that have unfairly targeted american muslims as security threats. we condemn the decades-long campaign to demonize and dehumanize the muslim faith community, which has led to increased rates of violence and discrimination targeting american muslims or those perceived to be muslim. we will hold accountable those who engage in or enable violent or other illegal activity targeting religious minorities, including by directing the federal government to address the growing and violent threat of white supremacist, neo-nazi and anti-government groups. supporting press freedom the free press is essential to our free democracy. democrats roundly reject president trump’s denigration of the free and independent press, which has endangered reporters’ lives, helped fuel conspiracy theories, and deepened distrust between americans and their government. democrats will appoint an independent media professional to head the u.s. agency for global media, to ensure that the news and information projected around the world by the federal government meets the highest standards of fact-based and unbiased journalism. democrats are concerned about the potentially harmful effects of corporate consolidation in the media industry, including in television, radio, and newspapers, and will reinstate and strengthen media ownership rules and direct federal antitrust agencies to investigate the economic impacts of mergers in the media industry. supporting the arts and culture the arts are essential to our free and democratic society, to our culture, and to our local economies. democrats are proud of our support for arts funding and education, and will continue policies and programs that promote the creative arts. we support public funding for the national endowment for the arts, the national endowment for the humanities, and for art and music education in public schools. we recognize that federal grants supporting nonprofit cultural organizations, artists, scholars, and state and local governments help increase participation in the arts, enhance appreciation, and strengthen our nation's cultural heritage. we value the arts and art education for developing imagination, creativity, innovation, and critical thinking skills in students and for building bridges between people and communities across the country and around the world. combating the climate crisis and pursuing environmental justice climate change is a global emergency. we have no time to waste in taking action to protect americans’ lives and futures. the last four years have seen record-breaking storms, devastating wildfires, and historic floods. urban and rural communities alike have suffered tens of billions of dollars in economic losses. dams have failed catastrophically in michigan. farmers’ crops have been drowned in their fields across the midwest. coastal communities from florida to new jersey are facing an existential crisis as a result of sea level rise and stronger storms. thousands of americans have died. and president trump still callously and willfully denies the science that explains why so many are suffering. like so many crises facing the united states, the impacts of climate change are not evenly distributed in our society or our economy. communities of color, low-income families, and indigenous communities have long suffered disproportionate and cumulative harm from air pollution, water pollution, and toxic sites. from flint, michigan, to the navajo nation, to lowndes county, alabama, millions of americans have been denied access to clean, safe drinking water and even the most basic wastewater infrastructure. pacific islanders in hawaii, guam, american samoa, and the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands are losing their traditional way of life as sea level rise submerges their homelands. and although the youngest generations of americans have contributed the least to this calamity, they stand to lose the most as they suffer from the impacts of runaway carbon pollution for decades to come. democrats believe there is a better way. we can and must build a thriving, equitable, and globally competitive clean energy economy that puts workers and communities first and leaves no one behind. we will help rebuild our economy from the covid- pandemic and president trump’s recession by mobilizing historic, transformative public and private investments to launch a clean energy revolution. we applaud the organizing efforts of young people, union workers, and communities of color to mobilize voters and make the climate crisis a top priority. as democrats, we believe the scientists: the window for unprecedented and necessary action is closing, and closing fast. democrats reject the false choice between growing our economy and combating climate change; we can and must do both at the same time. we will use federal resources and authorities across all agencies to deploy proven clean energy solutions; create millions of family-supporting and union jobs; upgrade and make resilient our energy, water, wastewater, and transportation infrastructure; and develop and manufacture next-generation technologies to address the climate crisis right here in the united states. and we will do all this with an eye to equity, access, benefits, and ownership opportunities for frontline communities— because democrats believe we must embed environmental justice, economic justice, and climate justice at the heart of our policy and governing agenda. we will take immediate action to reverse the trump administration’s dangerous and destructive rollbacks of critical climate and environmental protections. we will rejoin the paris climate agreement and, on day one, seek higher ambition from nations around the world, putting the united states back in the position of global leadership where we belong. we will restore protections for irreplaceable public lands and waters, from bears ears national monument to the arctic national wildlife refuge. we will follow science and the law by reducing harmful methane and carbon pollution from the energy sector. democrats will make investments to create millions of family-supporting and union jobs in clean energy generation, energy efficiency, clean transportation, advanced manufacturing, and sustainable agriculture across america. all jobs in the clean energy economy should provide an opportunity to join a union. democrats will restore and protect workers’ rights to organize and bargain collectively. the clean energy economy must represent the diversity of america. we will invest in the education and training of underrepresented groups, including people of color, low-income americans, women, veterans, people with disabilities, and unemployed energy workers for jobs in clean energy-related industries, especially union jobs that provide strong opportunities for economic advancement. democrats will target relevant investments with the goal of delivering percent of the overall benefits to disadvantaged and frontline communities, including in clean energy and energy efficiency; clean transit and transportation; affordable and sustainable housing; remediation and reduction of legacy pollution; and critical clean water infrastructure. democrats will also mobilize a diverse new generation of young workers through a corps and cohort challenged to conserve our public lands; deliver new clean energy, including to low-income communities and communities of color; and address the changing climate, including through pre-apprenticeship opportunities, joint labor-management registered apprenticeships for training, and direct-hire programs that put good-paying and union jobs within reach for more americans. black, latino, and immigrant workers are often on the front lines of disaster relief work with limited worker protections. democrats will invest in this critical workforce, supporting the creation of family-supporting and union jobs in disaster response and climate resilience, with strong labor standards and worker protections, including good wages, benefits, access to paid leave, training and advancement opportunities. we agree with scientists and public health experts that the united states—and the world—must achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, and no later than . to reach net-zero emissions as rapidly as possible, democrats commit to eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by through technology-neutral standards for clean energy and energy efficiency. we will dramatically expand solar and wind energy deployment through community-based and utility-scale systems, including in rural areas. within five years, we will install million solar panels, including eight million solar roofs and community solar energy systems, and , wind turbines, and turn american ingenuity into american jobs by leveraging federal policy to manufacture renewable energy solutions in america. recognizing the urgent need to decarbonize the power sector, our technology-neutral approach is inclusive of all zero-carbon technologies, including hydroelectric power, geothermal, existing and advanced nuclear, and carbon capture and storage. democrats believe that any clean energy infrastructure project financed with federal support, including through the tax code, should come with robust wage and labor requirements. we will build a modern electric grid by investing in interstate transmission projects and advanced, 21st century grid technologies to power communities with clean electricity, including federal support to build sustainable and resilient energy grids in rural america and in tribal areas lacking energy infrastructure. we will reduce methane pollution through strong federal standards and targeted support for repairing and replacing aging distribution systems, which will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, including for the same pipefitters, insulators, and other workers who built the systems in the first place and who know best how to protect our communities from methane pollution. democrats will lower families’ energy bills by making energy-saving upgrades to up to two million low-income households and affordable and public housing units within five years, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs and promoting safe, healthy, and efficient homes. we will ensure investments in affordable housing and public housing support both energy efficiency retrofits and construction of new units, to greatly increase the number of energy-efficient homes available to low-income families. we will address barriers and increase funding for programs that enable energy efficiency improvements for low-income families in urban and rural areas, including through the weatherization assistance program and the rural utilities service, and incentivize landlords to make energy efficiency and clean energy upgrades that will reduce their tenants’ energy costs. we will set a bold, national goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for all new buildings by , on the pathway to creating a percent clean building sector. within five years, we will incentivize tens of billions of dollars in private-sector investment to retrofit four million buildings, including helping local governments save money and cut pollution by weatherizing and upgrading energy systems in hospitals, schools, public housing, and municipal buildings. democrats will encourage states and cities to adopt energy-efficient building codes, address barriers to energy efficiency upgrades, incentivize the adoption of efficient electric and geothermal pump home heating solutions that can help reduce families’ energy burden, and leverage the federal footprint to model net-zero and percent clean energy building solutions. democrats affirm california’s statutory authority under the clean air act to set its own emissions standards for cars and trucks. we will immediately convene california and other states with labor, auto industry, and environmental leaders to inform ambitious executive actions that will enable the united states to lead the way in building a clean, 21st century transportation system and stronger domestic manufacturing base for electric vehicles powered by high-wage and union jobs. democrats will move quickly to reestablish strong standards for clean cars and trucks that consider the most recent advances in technology, and accelerate the adoption of zero-emission vehicles in the united states while reclaiming market share for domestically produced vehicles. we will reduce harmful air pollution and protect our children’s health by transitioning the entire fleet of , school buses to american-made, zero-emission alternatives within five years. we will lead by example in the public sector by transitioning the three million vehicles in the federal, state, and local fleets to zero-emission vehicles. democrats will additionally support private adoption of affordable low-pollution and zero-emission vehicles by partnering with state and local governments to install at least , public charging stations from coast to coast. we will increase investments in public transportation, understanding that the united states currently lags behind many other developed countries in the quality and availability of efficient and accessible public transportation. democrats will aim to provide all americans in municipalities with , or more residents with quality public transportation options by making flexible federal investments to upgrade and expand light rail, bus lines, existing transit systems, and pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure. democrats will invest in modernizing our freight infrastructure, including ports, rail, and maritime freight, in order to reduce air and water pollution, improve public health, create jobs, and improve economic competitiveness. democrats believe we can build the clean energy infrastructure of the future using american-made materials. we will support measures to build a clean, equitable, and globally competitive manufacturing sector, including national buy clean and buy america standards to incentivize production of low-carbon building and construction materials, like steel, cement, and timber, here in the united states. we will apply a carbon adjustment fee at the border to products from countries that fail to live up to their commitments under the paris climate agreement, because we won’t let polluters undermine american competitiveness. democrats will partner with farmers to make the american agriculture sector the first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions, opening up new sources of income for farmers in the process. we will substantially improve water security and ecological health through conservation, protection, and maintenance of our water infrastructure, including water systems for home, commercial, industrial, and agricultural use. we will expand federal programs to help farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners pursue high-productivity, lower-emission, and regenerative agricultural practices in order to help build more resilient, vibrant, local and regional food systems. we will substantially increase investments in voluntary conservation programs, which generate economic and environmental benefits for farmers and their surrounding communities. we will support healthy coastal communities and marine ecosystems to sustain and enhance our economic well-being, including in the fishing, tourism and clean energy industries. and we will support communities and businesses nationwide in their efforts to build zero-waste and circular economies, including efforts to eliminate plastic waste and food waste. every american has the right to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and live without fear of exposure to toxic waste. and all americans should benefit from the clean energy economy—especially those who have been left out and left behind for generations. democrats will create an environmental justice fund to make historic investments aimed at eliminating legacy pollution, which disproportionately causes illness and premature death in communities of color, low-income communities, and indigenous communities. we will protect children’s health by replacing lead service lines and remediating lead paint in homes and schools; remediate superfund and other contaminated sites; and ensure housing and schools have adequate plumbing and safe wastewater disposal systems. democrats oppose the trump administration's reckless and scientifically unsound decision to reverse a proposed ban on chlorpyrifos, a potent neurotoxin proven harmful to children and farmworkers. we will invest to help farmers reduce pesticide and chemical fertilizer use. and we will set science-based drinking water standards for emerging contaminants like pfoa and pfas chemicals and establish aggressive plans for remediating this dangerous pollution. energy companies should be held responsible for meeting strong standards to protect worker safety, public health, and the environment. democrats are committed to ensuring tough safeguards in place, including safe drinking water act provisions, to protect local water supplies. we believe states should not be able to preempt local government decisions about energy production. democrats will work with affected frontline communities to develop a screening and mapping tool to ensure racial and socioeconomic equity in federal climate, energy, and infrastructure programs and identify areas of high cumulative pollution that threatens residents’ health and safety. we will help reduce heat stress in urban neighborhoods by planting millions of trees. we will support locally-driven economic development a nd commit to directing a significant portion of clean energy and sustainable infrastructure investments to historically marginalized communities to help create local jobs and reduce energy poverty, install clean energy technologies including community solar, build resilience to climate change impacts, prepare for disasters, expand access to green space and outdoor recreation opportunities, improve public health, and restore ecosystems. already, the impacts of climate change are being felt in communities across the country, and the american people are paying the price. democrats commit to reducing climate risks and building back better after disasters and climate-fueled catastrophes in a resilient, green, and just manner. we will empower local communities to become more resilient to the impacts of the climate crisis. we will prioritize disaster preparedness for disproportionately exposed, frontline, and vulnerable communities and those who struggle most to cope, including seniors, low-income families, and people with disabilities, so that they can become more economically resilient to extreme weather events, heat stress, and increases in disease that scientists have connected to climate change. we will rectify the inequities and inefficiencies of disaster response, including transparent and timely reporting and oversight and protections and enforcement of disability rights. democrats will ensure fema has the experienced leadership, staff, and resources necessary to coordinate the federal response to climate change-influenced and other disasters, and is equipped to work in partnership with, and drive federal resources to, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments to mount a successful emergency response in conjunction with local emergency responders, help communities recover and rebuild, and invest in pre-disaster mitigation and resilience. we will increase support for restoring wetlands, which are critical for protecting communities from sea level rise and storm surge and also act as natural carbon sinks. we will partner with states and local communities to make smart investments to avoid the loss of life and property, prevent flooding, mitigate disaster risks, and adapt to costly, growing climate impacts. democrats recognize that climate change poses serious risks to the economy and the financial system. we will require public companies to disclose climate risks and greenhouse gas emissions in their operations and supply chains. we will hold polluters and corporate executives accountable for intentionally hiding or distorting material information and for affecting the health and safety of workers and communities. democrats will empower and stand with workers and communities who have put their health and lives on the line and who have been impacted by the changing energy market, including by fighting to protect retirees’ health and pension benefits, shoring up the black lung disability trust fund, expanding the radiation exposure compensation act to include those harmed by our nation’s nuclear weapons efforts including uranium miners exposed to radiation on the job, and increasing funding for the appalachian regional commission to support locally-driven economic development priorities. we will hold fossil fuel companies accountable for cleaning up abandoned mine lands, oil and gas wells, and industrial sites, so these facilities no longer pollute local environments and can be safely repurposed to support new economic activity, including in the heart of coal country. democrats will support the most historically far reaching public investments and private sector incentives for research, development, demonstration, and deployment of next-generation technologies, once again making the united states the world’s leader in innovation. we will challenge the best and brightest scientists, innovators, and entrepreneurs in the world to pursue breakthrough opportunities in energy storage, heavy-duty trucking and freight solutions, sustainable aviation fuels, and direct air capture and net-negative emissions technologies. we will advance innovative technologies that create cost-effective pathways for industries to decarbonize, including carbon capture and sequestration that permanently stores greenhouse gases and advanced nuclear that eliminates waste associated with conventional nuclear technology, while ensuring environmental justice and other overburdened communities are protected from increases in cumulative pollution. all of these investments will create jobs for blue-collar workers, including in fenceline communities, help decarbonize american industries, and create valuable new exports to help mitigate climate change around the world. america’s national parks and monuments, public lands, and marine protected areas are treasures that should be held in trust for future generations. we will protect these precious places and preserve america’s unspoiled wildernesses for hunting, fishing, hiking, and camping by codifying the roadless rule, and grow america’s outdoor recreation economy, which supports millions of jobs in rural areas. democrats will immediately reverse the trump administration’s harmful rollbacks of protections for national monuments like grand staircase-escalante national monument and northeast canyons and seamounts marine national monument. we support banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters, modifying royalties to account for climate costs, and establishing targeted programs to enhance reforestation and develop renewables on federal lands and waters. we will take action to protect wildernesses and waters, and require full, rigorous, and transparent scientific and environmental reviews of any proposed mining projects near national treasures. democrats will protect wildlife habitats and biodiversity, slow extinction rates, and grow america’s natural carbon sinks by conserving percent of our lands and waters by . we support fully funding the land and water conservation fund to increase resources for conserving public lands and waters and incentivizing voluntary conservation efforts on private lands, including through private-sector ecosystems markets. and democrats will ensure america’s public lands and waters reflect the diversity of our country by engaging all americans in the great outdoors, building a diverse workforce in our land management agencies, and protecting landscapes, marinescapes, and cultural sites that tell the full story of america. restoring and strengthening our democracy our government and our elections are supposed to reflect the interests of the american people, not only the wealthiest few and the biggest corporations. democrats will fight to restore and protect americans’ fundamental right to vote, including by aggressively pushing back against republican governors, legislatures, and state officials who have disenfranchised people of color, young people, low-income people, and people with disabilities. and we will strictly enforce ethics laws and improve transparency across the federal government in order to rebuild trust with the american people, and will protect civil servants and whistleblowers from political retribution. protecting and enforcing voting rights democrats are committed to the sacred principle of “one person, one vote” —and we will fight to achieve that principle for every citizen, regardless of race, income, disability status, geography, or english language proficiency. we stand united against the determined republican campaign to disenfranchise voters through onerous voter id laws, unconstitutional and excessive purges of the voter rolls, and closures of polling places in low-income neighborhoods, on college campuses, and in communities of color. americans should never have to wait in hours-long lines to exercise their voting rights. democrats will strengthen our democracy by guaranteeing that every american’s vote is protected. we will make it a priority to pass legislation that restores and strengthens the voting rights act, and ensure the department of justice challenges state laws that make it harder for americans to vote. we will make voting easier and more accessible for all americans by supporting automatic voter registration, same-day voter registration, early voting, and universal vote-from-home and vote-by-mail options. democrats believe election day should be a national holiday, in celebration of our democratic institutions and to make it easier for everyone to cast their ballot. democrats recognize that unions, community groups, faith organizations and other civic organizations are critical to facilitating registration, encouraging voting, and protecting voter rights. we will fully implement the help america vote act and require that polling places and elections are accessible for people with disabilities, and work to ensure that returning citizens have their voting rights restored upon release from jail or prison without the additional hurdle of having to pay fines and fees in order to vote. democrats will also fight for emergency funding for states to help make vote-from-home and vote-by-mail universally available during the pandemic, while ensuring that all jurisdictions take steps to ensure continued meaningful, safe opportunities to vote in person. we recognize that the united states postal service is more than ever a critical component to our democracy and must be supported to guarantee timely and efficient delivery and return of vote by mail ballots. election officials must be provided with sufficient time after election day to process, count, and audit all ballots. we must give voters the confidence that their ballot was counted as cast by supporting mandatory, statistically meaningful post-election audits and full transparency of all election results and data. to ensure every eligible ballot is counted, vote by mail voters must be informed of and provided a meaningful opportunity to fix any problem with their ballot. a professional and well-trained election workforce is critical to the administration of elections, we support ongoing federal and state funding for local elections offices. gerrymandering distorts our democracy, and democrats will enact measures to end partisan gerrymandering in federal elections. efforts to redraw legislative districts following the census must be guided by transparency and public input, while reducing the power of partisan actors, so that maps reflect the will of voters, fairly represent communities of color, and provide for competitive races. we will protect the integrity of the decennial census from political interference, including ensuring that apportionment and redistricting be based on total population counts, and also ensure the census bureau is equipped to conduct cost-effective, timely, and accurate surveys. democrats will maintain the legal requirement for census participation and increase resources to reduce undercounts of communities of color, immigrants, lgbtq+ people, people with disabilities, rural and low-income populations, and young children that have long plagued the decennial census. we will also direct the census bureau to study whether counting the prison population where they are incarcerated creates inequitable outcomes in state or federal representation or funding allocations. democrats will increase investments to help state and local governments upgrade election technology, including cybersecurity technology, and ensure that election technology is accessible for people with disabilities. democrats will also increase oversight of private election vendors to ensure voting systems are secure and worthy of voters' trust. we will not tolerate election interference and will protect the integrity of our elections from all enemies, foreign and domestic. reforming the broken campaign finance system democrats believe that the interests and the voices of the american people should determine our elections. money is not speech, and corporations are not people. democrats will fight to pass a constitutional amendment that will go beyond merely overturning citizens united and related decisions like buckley v. valeo by eliminating all private financing from federal elections. in the meantime, democrats will work with congress on legislation to strengthen the public funding system by matching small-dollar donations for all federal candidates, crack down on foreign nationals who try to influence elections, and ensure that super pacs are wholly independent of campaigns and political parties. we will bring an end to “dark money” by requiring full disclosure of contributors to any group that advocates for or against candidates, and bar (c)() organizations from spending money on elections. democrats will ban corporate pacs from donating to candidates and bar lobbyists from donating, fundraising, or bundling for anyone they lobby. building an effective, transparent federal government every federal employee swears an oath to support and defend the constitution. it is a sacred promise to the american people—that federal workers, both civil servants and political appointees, will put the interests of the many ahead of their own personal concerns. president trump and his administration have abused the trust between the american people and their government—including by denigrating civil servants, directing federal grants and contracts toward their cronies and political donors, inappropriately interfering with federal investigations and firing independent watchdogs, retaliating against whistleblowers, failing to share information as required with congress, and, most nefariously, violating the law by withholding congressionally appropriated funds in an attempt to get a foreign government to interfere in america’s elections. democrats will establish a commission on federal ethics to aggressively enforce and strengthen federal ethics laws, including rules around personal financial disclosures for executive branch officials, and make campaign finance, financial disclosure, and lobbying disclosure filings easier for the public to access and understand. we support requiring all candidates for federal office, including presidential candidates, to publicly disclose at least years of tax returns. the american people deserve assurances that their elected officials and federal appointees work for them, not for special interests. democrats will re-establish merit-based federal contracting decisions and prohibit political appointees, at the white house or in agency leadership, from interfering in grantmaking. we will restore and re-empower independent inspectors general across the federal government and work to strengthen whistleblower protections to fully protect federal employees from retaliation. and we will ban lobbying by foreign governments and significantly lower the threshold for having to register as a federal lobbyist in order to close loopholes that allow special interests to secretly influence policymaking in congress and across the federal government. democrats condemn president trump's determination to sow chaos and division by inappropriately deploying federal agents to american cities, where too many have used egregious tactics against peaceful protestors. we know federal agents can ably protect federal property while also clearly displaying badges, insignias, and identifying markings; without detaining americans in undisclosed locations without cause; and without brutally attacking peaceful protestors. democrats are committed to following the rule of law and will uphold the first amendment right to peaceably assemble. the republican party has packed our federal courts with unqualified, partisan judges who consistently rule for corporations, the wealthy, and republican interests. they have undermined the legitimacy of our courts through an anti-democratic, win-at-all costs campaign that includes blocking a democratic president from appointing a justice to the supreme court and obstructing dozens of diverse lower-court nominees. the democratic party recognizes the need for structural court reforms to increase transparency and accountability. now more than ever, federal agencies need experts on staff who know how to use science, evidence, data, and facts to guide decision-making on behalf of the american people. as the covid- pandemic demonstrates, our country needs the best experts working within government to protect and improve the lives of all americans. democrats support the recruitment of people with expertise in science, social science, technology, and innovation to jobs in public service to help solve our nation’s most pressing challenges. to ensure that federal funds are invested as effectively and efficiently as possible, the federal government should be using the best available evidence when making budget and spending decisions. democrats will ensure federal data collection and analysis is adequately funded and designed to allow for disaggregation by race, gender, lgbtq+ status, geography, disability status, and other important variables, so that disparities can be better understood and addressed. democrats support the widespread use of strategies to promote evidence-based policymaking, including more robust evaluations of tax expenditures and allocating funds for program evaluation, to help ensure the american people are receiving the most productive, efficient services from our federal government. making washington, d.c. the 51st state it’s time to stop treating the more than , people who live in our nation’s capital as second-class citizens. the residents of washington, d.c. pay more per capita in federal income taxes than any state in the country—and more in total federal income tax than states—and yet the district has zero voting representatives in the u.s. congress. the congress retains broad power to override budget decisions made by democratically elected officials in washington, d.c. and as was made shockingly clear to the american people this year, under current law, washington, d.c. does not have control over its own national guard units and can be occupied by military forces at the president’s whim. the citizens of washington, d.c.—a majority of whom are people of color—voted overwhelmingly in favor of statehood in a referendum and have ratified a state constitution. democrats unequivocally support statehood for washington, d.c., so the citizens of the district can at last have full and equal representation in congress and the rights of self-determination. guaranteeing self-determination for puerto rico the people of puerto rico deserve self-determination on the issue of status. democrats are committed to helping the island rebuild and recover from the devastation wrought by hurricanes irma and maria and the recent earthquakes, and will mobilize resources across the federal government to address the island’s disparities in energy, infrastructure, health care, education, housing, agriculture, employment, and disaster preparedness. disaster response in puerto rico must be given the same priority and be conducted on the same basis as federal responses to natural disasters elsewhere in the united states. we will forgive disaster relief loans issued to puerto rican municipalities following hurricanes irma and maria to help expedite the island’s economic recovery. the unequal treatment of puerto rico’s residents must end. we will invest in the island’s future through economic development initiatives, increased education funding, construction of affordable housing, and innovative energy and climate resilience programs. democrats support accelerating access to disaster recovery funds so the island can improve its infrastructure and transform itself into one of the fastest-growing, most prosperous parts of the united states. we also believe puerto rico should be treated equally with respect to federal programs, including medicaid, snap, and the child tax credit. bankruptcy blocks puerto rico’s growth and recovery. democrats will help restructure and provide relief from puerto rico’s remaining debt burden and work with the government of puerto rico to accelerate progress in order to dissolve the financial oversight and management board. supporting the u.s. territories democrats recognize and honor the contributions and sacrifices made in service of our country by the americans living in the territories of guam, american samoa, the u.s. virgin islands, and the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands. the people of the u.s. territories have played a vital role in american democracy for more than years, and have for too long been met with unequal treatment by the federal government. we support establishing a congressional task force to gather findings on voting rights in the territories, and recommend changes to congress to allow for the full and equal voting rights of u.s. citizens who are residents of the territories in federal elections, and for full and equal voting representation in the u.s. house of representatives. the american citizens of the u.s. territories should have the right to vote for president of the united states. democrats will support self-determination for the people of the u.s territories, including respecting their right to decide their future status in a fair, binding, and equitable manner. the u.s. virgin islands suffered significant impacts as a result of hurricanes irma and maria, and the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands, guam, and american samoa have suffered damages as a result of intensifying pacific typhoons and cyclones. democrats will support investments to help the u.s. territories recover from recent natural disasters and build increased resilience to the impacts of climate change, including by expanding access to clean, affordable, reliable energy and water systems. we will mobilize resources to address disparities in agriculture, economic development, education, employment, energy, health care, housing, and infrastructure in the u.s. territories to help the territories diversify their economies and recover from the covid- pandemic. we will improve health care access and affordability and support policies to address health disparities in the u.s. territories. we believe the territories should be treated equally with respect to important federal programs, including the affordable care act, medicaid, snap, and the child tax credit, that reduce poverty and support working families. and democrats commit to ensuring veterans from the u.s. territories have access to timely and quality health care and other benefits through the va. democrats will continue to work with the people of guam to properly memorialize residents who suffered unspeakable harm as a result of their u.s. nationality during the imperial japanese occupation of guam during world war ii. we recognize the increasing demands placed on state and territorial governments by migration under the compacts of free association (cofa), and will explore mechanisms for increasing reimbursement of costs absorbed by guam, the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands, and hawaii. and democrats will restore medicaid eligibility for migrants under cofa who are legally residing, working, and studying in the united states, but who were inadvertently left out of health care legislation. strengthening the u.s. postal service the u.s. postal service (usps) is the world’s most efficient mail carrier, and democrats are wholly committed to supporting a public usps. we will fight all efforts to privatize the usps and will work to ensure the usps is financially sustainable, including by repealing the mandate that the agency “pre-fund” retiree health costs. democrats will protect the postal service’s universal service obligation as a core american value and maintain six-day and doorstep mail delivery, which is a lifeline for rural americans. and we will work to restore service to appropriate levels, including overnight delivery of first-class mail and periodicals within the same metropolitan area, maintaining six-day and door-to door delivery, and appointing members to the board of governors and the postal regulatory commission who champion a strong public postal service. we will also support new revenue streams for the usps, including allowing secure shipping of alcoholic beverages by mail and exploring options to enable unbanked and underbanked americans to access financial services through the postal service. creating a 21st century immigration system out of many, we are one. that bedrock american idea has animated our country from its earliest days, inspiring people from every corner of the earth to participate in our great democratic experiment. the trump administration has repudiated that idea and abandoned our values as a diverse, compassionate, and welcoming country. instead of pursuing a sensible, humane, and responsible approach to immigration that strengthens the united states, the trump administration has been callous, cruel, and reckless in the extreme. president trump’s immigration policies have made our communities less safe, undermined our economy, and tarnished our image around the world. this administration’s cruelty and dehumanization of immigrants stretches the imagination and shocks the conscience: forcibly separating families and putting children in cages; deporting veterans who have fought to defend our freedoms; conducting militarized raids on our workplaces; endangering lives by denying covid- testing and treatment based on immigration status, including to essential workers at the forefront of the pandemic response; banning people from traveling to the united states based on their faith or their country of origin; and turning away refugees and asylum seekers fleeing violence and persecution. these actions should not happen in our country again. democrats believe america can do better. indeed, we must. the truth is that our immigration system was broken long before president trump came into office, and his departure alone won’t fix it. immigrants are essential to our society and our economy. immigrants are part of our families. they enrich our culture. they grow our food, care for our loved ones, serve in our armed forces, and provide critical health care services. immigrants make america stronger. not only do immigrants support us—immigrants are us. our families and our communities, our congregations and our schools, our businesses large and small have been built and sustained through the inclusion of immigrants. that’s why democrats commit to building a 21st century immigration system that reflects our values, repairs past harms, heals our communities, rebuilds our economy, and renews our global leadership. we will start by righting the wrongs of the trump administration. democrats will rescind president trump’s fabricated “national emergency,” which siphons funding away from our men and women in uniform to construct an unnecessary, wasteful, and ineffective wall on the southern border. we will immediately terminate the trump administration’s discriminatory travel and immigration bans that disproportionately impact muslim, arab, and african people, and invite those whose visas have been denied under these xenophobic and un-american policies to re-apply to come to the united states. we will support legislation to ensure that no president can enact discriminatory bans ever again. we will reinstate, expand, and streamline protections for dreamers and the parents of american citizen children to keep families together in the communities they have long called home. democrats believe the united states should be a beacon of hope for those who are suffering violence and injustice, which is why we will protect and expand the existing asylum system and other humanitarian protections. we will reverse trump administration policies that prevent victims of gang and domestic violence, as well as lgbtq+ people who are unsafe in their home countries, from being eligible to apply for asylum. democrats will end trump administration policies that deny protected entry to asylum seekers, put them at great risk, and destabilize our neighbors and the broader region. and we will end prosecution of asylum seekers at the border and policies that force them to apply from “safe third countries,” which are far from safe. democrats believe that our fight to end systemic and structural racism in our country extends to our immigration system, including the policies at our borders and ports of entry, detention centers, and within immigration law enforcement agencies and their policies and operations. and democrats will immediately halt enforcement of and rescind the trump administration’s un-american immigrant wealth test. even as we work to reverse the enormous damage caused by the trump administration, we are determined to build a 21st century immigration system that embodies our values, expands economic opportunity for all americans, and enhances our global competitiveness. democrats believe it is long past time to provide a roadmap to citizenship for the millions of undocumented workers, caregivers, students, and children who are an essential part of our economy and of the fabric of our nation. we will fast-track this process for those workers who have been essential to the pandemic response and recovery efforts, including health care workers, farmworkers, and others. we will also eliminate unfair barriers to naturalization, reduce application backlogs, and make our immigration processes faster, more efficient, and less costly. these reforms will strengthen our communities, our families, our economy, and our country. democrats oppose president trump’s illegal, chaotic, and reckless changes to the legal immigration system, including decisions to slash family-based immigration as well as h-1b and other visa programs that can help our economy. democrats believe family unity should be a guiding principle for our immigration policy. we will prioritize family reunification for children still separated from their families, and we will restore family reunification programs ended by the trump administration. we support legislation to treat the spouses and children of green card holders as immediate relatives and end their unfair separation. we will eliminate family-based green card backlogs and reform the system to speed up family-based visas. and we will work with congress to eliminate immigration barriers, such as the three- and -year bars, and remove the -year waiting period for waivers to the permanent bars that keep loved ones apart. we believe we should expand, not reduce, the annual visa cap for victims of human trafficking, including victims of sex trafficking, violence against women and children, and other heinous crimes; ensure that same sex-couples and their children receive equal treatment in the immigration and naturalization systems; reaffirm america’s commitment to family-based immigration; and preserve the critical role of diversity preferences in our immigration system. democrats will ensure that law-abiding individuals with temporary protected status or deferred enforced departure are not sent back to countries where they cannot live safely, and we will work to pave a path to citizenship for those who have been in the country for an extended period of time and built their lives in the united states. democrats know that when employers feel free to abuse and bully immigrant workers, all workers suffer. that’s why we will hold employers accountable, promote workers’ rights, and prioritize the enforcement of labor and employment laws across the economy, including discrimination and sexual harassment protections, wage and hour laws, and health and safety rules. we will prevent employers from taking advantage of immigrant workers by establishing an affirmative process to request deferred action for workers who report labor violations and by supporting the domestic workers’ bill of rights and the protect our workers from exploitation and retaliation (power) act. we will ensure that enforcement mechanisms are humane and consistent with our values and international humanitarian obligations. that’s why we will end workplace and community raids. we will protect sensitive locations like our schools, houses of worship, health care facilities, benefits offices, and dmvs from immigration enforcement actions, and prohibit raids in which children and members of vulnerable populations are left behind without their caregivers. we will prohibit enforcement actions that deter access to justice at courthouses and repress freedom of speech and assembly, end programs that force state and local law enforcement to also be responsible for immigration enforcement, and stop targeting men and women who served in uniform and their families. we will reaffirm enforcement officials’ ability to engage in the pre-trump practice of prosecutorial discretion for deserving cases, including when needed to address humanitarian issues or other injustices. we will also prevent enforcement officials from retaliating against individuals for their political speech or activity, or because of their efforts to advocate for individuals’ rights. we believe detention should be a last resort, not the default. democrats will prioritize investments in more effective and cost-efficient community-based alternatives to detention. we will end for-profit detention centers and ensure that any facility where migrants are being detained is held to the highest standards of care and guarantees their safety and dignity. we will ensure all detention centers provide access to competent interpreters who speak migrants' native languages and dialects. detention of children should be restricted to the shortest possible time, with their access to education and proper care ensured. we will prioritize alternatives to detention for individuals with special vulnerabilities—those who are known to be suffering from serious physical or mental illness, who have disabilities, who are elderly, pregnant, or nursing, who demonstrate that they are primary caretakers of children or an infirm person, identify as gay, lesbian, transgender, gender non-conforming, or intersex, or whose detention is otherwise not in the public interest. democrats will implement robust mechanisms for oversight, accountability, and transparency to ensure immigration agencies abide by our values, the u.s. constitution, and international law. democrats believe immigration judges should be able to operate free of inappropriate political influence, and will support steps to make immigration courts more independent. we will demand that leaders of our immigration agencies be senate-confirmed professionals, and that immigration and customs enforcement and customs and border protection personnel abide by our values and professional, evidence-based standards and are held accountable for any inappropriate, unlawful, or inhumane treatment. a 21st century immigration system that honors our values is an essential prerequisite not just to recovering from the worst economic crisis since the great depression, but to strengthening our democracy and guaranteeing america’s long-term economic competitiveness. that’s why democrats believe in improving and increasing opportunities for legal, permanent immigration. our family, humanitarian, and diversity pathways have contributed immeasurably to the vibrancy and productivity of american society and should continue to be the centerpiece of our immigration system . we also support awarding visas for permanent, employment-based immigration in a way that is responsive to labor market needs. we want to attract and keep talent in this country, which is why democrats will end the trump administration’s freeze on green cards for new immigrants and instead pursue a meaningful reform agenda. democrats support policies and programs to make it easier for qualified immigrants and their families to become full and equal citizens, including increasing funding for culturally appropriate immigrant inclusion and citizenship services, legal support, english classes and bilingual education, workforce development, and adult education. finally, democrats will address the root causes of migration—violence and insecurity, poverty, pervasive corruption, lack of educational and economic opportunity, and the impacts of climate change. disciplined american leadership and well-designed assistance programs can help prevent and mitigate the effects of migration crises around the world, from southeast asia to sub-saharan africa to central america. we will support a comprehensive strategy to strengthen security and prosperity in partnership with the people of central america and the caribbean and with the support of the international community. and we will renew american diplomacy as our tool of first resort, rebuild our partnerships and alliances, and once again lead the global humanitarian response. providing a world-class education in every zip code education is fundamental to the idea of america and to fulfilling our nation’s promise. it is the key to addressing the challenges before us— to growing our economy, maintaining american competitiveness on the world stage, and building a more just, equitable, civically engaged, and socially conscientious nation. as democrats, we believe that education is a critical public good—not a commodity— and that it is the government’s responsibility to ensure that every child, everywhere, is able to receive a world-class education that enables them to lead meaningful lives, no matter their race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, religion, disability status, language status, immigration or citizenship status, household income or zip code. for too long, we have short-changed our children by underinvesting in our nation’s public schools and in our higher education system. despite ample research showing that early childhood education can improve outcomes for students for decades to come, we still do not have universal, high-quality pre-k. despite the decades-long trend that has seen more and more women entering the labor force as breadwinners, it is still far too difficult for families to secure safe and affordable child care services. our public schools are bedrock community institutions, and yet our educators are underpaid, our classrooms are overstuffed, and our school buildings have been neglected, especially in low-income neighborhoods and communities of color. roughly six in jobs require at least some education beyond high school, and yet the ever-rising cost of college tuition and fees leaves higher education out of reach —or saddles students with a lifetime of debt. the emergency conditions created by the covid- pandemic have vividly demonstrated to parents, students, and educators across the country that there is no sustainable, long-term substitute for high-quality, in-classroom learning. significant gaps in access to technology, including lack of access to high-speed broadband and connected devices, have deepened inequities in our educational system for students of color, students with disabilities, english language learners, and students in rural areas and under-resourced neighborhoods during this pandemic. we will significantly increase federal investments in rural, urban, and tribal broadband infrastructure to close the digital divide and ensure students can access educational resources from their homes and schools now and in the future. we will need increased investments in public education to help students get back on track when public health experts determine it is safe to return to schools. democrats believe we can and must do better for our children, our educators, and our country. we are committed to making the investments our students and teachers need to build equity and safeguard humanity in our educational system and guarantee every child can receive a great education. to this end, we support k- instruction in civics and climate literacy. we will support evidence-based programs and pedagogical approaches, including assessments that consider the well-being of the whole student and recognize the range of ways students can demonstrate learning. we will reimagine our education system guided by the stakeholders and qualified, first-class, well-trained, passionate educators who know these issues best: young people, educators, parents, and community leaders. democrats fundamentally believe our education system should prepare all our students—indeed, all of us—for college, careers, lifelong learning, and to be informed, engaged citizens of our communities, our country, and our planet. guaranteeing universal early childhood education democrats believe that all children across the united states should have access to high-quality early childhood education programs. we will work with states to offer pre-k for all three- and four-year-olds and expand head start and early head start. we will drive increased resources to the communities with the highest need, including those with the highest concentrations of low-income students, impoverished urban areas impacted by gentrification, and rural areas, and will strive to support holistic school readiness. we also will ensure students with disabilities and english language learners have access to and are fully included in early childhood programs. we recognize that learning starts at birth, and the exorbitant costs of safe, quality child care present a significant economic burden to families. democrats support making child care and dependent tax credits significantly more generous and will increase funding to states to guarantee that low-income and middle class families can afford child care. we will make major investments to increase quality options for parents and increase compensation for providers. democrats also support expanding proven programs for low-income and first-time parents, guardians, and caregivers, including home visiting, that can help connect families in need to child care, education, and child development opportunities and improve outcomes for children and parents alike. democrats also support raising early childhood standards and providing ongoing professional development for early childhood educators, to ensure that children’s academic, social development, behavioral, and cognitive needs are being met. democrats believe that early childhood educators, like all educators and all workers, should be paid a family-supporting wage, have access to benefits and paid leave, and be able to organize, join a union, and collectively bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions. supporting high-quality k- schools across america each year, the united states spends $ billion more on schools in predominantly white districts than in non-white districts. using property taxes to fund public k- schools results in inequitable treatment for students in low-income school districts, compared to those in wealthier areas. democrats are committed to closing the school funding gap by tripling title i funding, which benefits schools that serve low-income students, and incentivizing states to adopt progressive funding formulas that direct resources to the schools that need it most. we will also ensure sustainable, reliable funding for rural schools, schools in impoverished urban areas impacted by gentrification, and bureau of indian education schools. as the covid- pandemic has made plain, our public schools are more than places where children learn—they are pillars of our neighborhoods and our society. democrats believe that no student should ever be shamed over school lunch debt, and support expanding universal free school meal programs. we will also support wraparound health care and nutrition services, before- and after-school programs, adult education classes, and other services by significantly expanding the community school model. students should have multiple public school pathways to be able to access the opportunities they deserve. democrats will work to expand access to career and technical education, magnet schools for science and the arts, international baccalaureate programs, and early college high schools to offer multiple pathways to meet the diverse needs and interests of america’s high school students. we will increase investments in high-quality science, technology, engineering, and mathematics programs in our public schools, support access to computer science for all and improve professional development opportunities for math and science teachers, including through the creation of a national science corps of outstanding stem teachers serving as leaders in their schools and communities. democrats believe we must prioritize steam education and funding for underrepresented students, including students of color, girls, and low-income students, to help remove enrollment and achievement barriers. we will equip students with the knowledge and skills to understand complex scientific issues, counter the rising tide of denialism by promoting environmental and climate literacy, and reverse the trump administration's cuts to the national environmental education act. in addition to developing strong literacy, numeracy, and steam skills, our education system should develop the deep learning and life skills needed to thrive in the 21st century economy, including critical and creative thinking, leadership, and judgment and decision-making. charter schools were originally intended to be publicly funded schools with increased flexibility in program design and operations. democrats believe that education is a public good and should not be saddled with a private profit motive, which is why we will ban for-profit private charter businesses from receiving federal funding. and we recognize the need for more stringent guardrails to ensure charter schools are good stewards of federal education funds. we support measures to increase accountability for charter schools, including by requiring all charter schools to meet the same standards of transparency as traditional public schools, including with regard to civil rights protections, racial equity, admissions practices, disciplinary procedures, and school finances. we will call for conditioning federal funding for new, expanded charter schools or for charter school renewals on a district’s review of whether the charter will systematically underserve the neediest students. and democrats oppose private school vouchers and other policies that divert taxpayer-funded resources away from the public school system, including the program at issue in the recent espinoza decision. democrats are committed to safe and supportive school climates for students and educators alike. guns have no place in our schools. we disagree strongly with the trump administration’s dangerous and short-sighted suggestion that teachers should bring firearms into the classroom. democrats also believe that all schools should have adequate resources to expand school-based health services and hire guidance counselors, social workers, nurses, and school psychologists to help support students’ mental health needs, address trauma, and promote social and emotional development. we will work with school administrators, educators, students, and mental health advocates to reduce the stigma that too often prevents students from seeking out these resources. democrats will make sure schools do not engage in, and appropriately address, discrimination, bullying and harassment related to sex, including sexual orientation and gender identity; race; national origin; immigration or citizenship status; religion; disability; and language status. we will protect the rights of transgender students. it is unacceptable that america’s public schools are more racially segregated today than they were in the late 1960s. schools—and classrooms and programs within schools—continue to be segregated by race and class. and, with increasing frequency, students are being unnecessarily and unlawfully segregated by disability, language status and through the use of exclusionary discipline and school-based arrests. we believe that schools must no longer engage in segregation and segregative practices. democrats support appointing judges who will enforce the civil rights act in schools. we will fund federal programs to promote integration and school diversity, including magnet schools and school transportation initiatives. we will also reinvigorate and increase funding for the department of education’s office of civil rights, expand the civil rights data collection to inform civil rights enforcement and the public on the status of equal educational opportunity for all children, and build on the strength in diversity act to increase federal funding for community-driven strategies to desegregate schools. all children have the constitutional right to go to school. schools should be safe zones for children and their families, which is why democrats will protect sensitive locations like schools from immigration enforcement actions. democrats believe that english learners should be recognized as bringing an asset, rather than a deficit, with them to school. we recognize the need for significantly increased funding and support for english learners to ensure they can participate meaningfully and equally in school. democrats will protect the civil rights of limited english proficient parents so they receive information in the language they understand and are able to meaningfully participate in their child’s education, including through public meetings and community decision-making mechanisms. democrats believe in providing equal educational opportunities for students with disabilities. we will fully fund the individuals with disabilities education act and fully implement its requirements for a free appropriate public education and least restrictive environment. we will support aggressive enforcement of section of the rehabilitation act and the americans with disabilities act, including the integration mandate of the olmstead decision, and provide school districts with additional resources to better serve students with disabilities. we will ban seclusion and prevent and decrease use of physical restraint, in partnership with teachers, school administrators, and the disability rights movement. democrats also support aggressive enforcement of the americans with disabilities act in schools and other settings. the covid- pandemic has made long-standing educational disparities evident to all americans. democrats will prioritize equitable education and access for students with disabilities, english language learners, low-income students, students of color, and urban and rural students, including those who are homeless, are immigrants or refugees, or are in the foster care or juvenile justice systems. remote instruction must be individualized to the greatest possible extent and reasonable modifications should be provided for students with disabilities even during a pandemic. the evidence from nearly two decades of education reforms that hinge on standardized test scores shows clearly that high-stakes testing has not led to enough improvement in outcomes for students or for schools, and can lead to discrimination against students, particularly students with disabilities, students of color, low-income students, and english language learners. democrats will work to end the use of such high-stakes tests and encourage states to develop reliable, continuous, evidence-based approaches to student assessment that rely on multiple and holistic measures that better represent student achievement. assessments will provide families with clear, accessible, consistent information about how well schools are serving individual students and groups of students, while better representing student achievement. students, parents, and educators will be supported by data collection and analysis disaggregated by race, gender, disability status, and other important variables, to identify and address disparities in educational equity, access, and outcomes. educators have always been heroes. the covid- pandemic has made the value that educators provide to children, parents, and the economy obvious as never before to tens of millions of americans. public school educators should have the same rights to organize, join a union, and collectively bargain as private sector workers. democrats will fight to significantly increase pay and benefits for all educators, in order to help recruit, retain, and reward high-quality teachers and support professionals, and will continue to support measures to help teachers pay for out-of-pocket classroom expenses. we will support programs to help introduce high school students to the teaching profession, enable school support staff to climb the professional ladder within schools, and recruit a diverse educational workforce through partnerships with hbcus, msis, and tcus. making higher education affordable and accessible democrats believe that everyone should be able to earn a degree beyond high school, if they choose to, without money standing in the way. that is why we will make public colleges and universities tuition-free for students whose families earn less than $,—roughly percent of the american people. we will double the maximum pell grant award for low-income students, and double federal support for trio programs that help first-generation college students, students with disabilities, veterans, and other underrepresented groups apply to and complete college. hbcus, msis, and tcus serve a disproportionate number of low-income students who might otherwise be unable to access a college degree, and yet these vital institutions are chronically under-resourced. democrats will work to provide grants to hbcus, msis, and tcus to lower student costs, increase academic research capabilities, and ensure these essential institutions can continue to thrive in the future. democrats support making community colleges and trade schools tuition-free for all students, including dreamers. our nation’s network of two-year community colleges provides accessible, high-quality education for students of all ages. democrats will additionally support and expand pre-apprenticeship opportunities and registered apprenticeships with formal worker representation in program development to provide a clear pathway to high-quality jobs that does not require attending college. we will increase federal support for services like child care on college campuses, so more students are able to balance the demands of school and family and graduate with degrees. democrats also support increased funding for wraparound services, including covering the cost of textbooks and fees for low-income students and establishing programs to address campus food insecurity, so students can focus on what matters most: their studies. democrats will fight to create a federal funding program for higher education, modeled on title i funding for k- schools, that would direct funds to public and nonprofit colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions based on the proportion of low-income students those schools enroll and graduate. we will promote transparency and fairness regarding higher education faculty working conditions, including adjuncts, graduate employees, and full-time lecturers who are often grossly underpaid compared to full professors, and support and encourage professor tenure. and democrats will safeguard academic freedom on college campuses. democrats oppose the trump administration’s cruel and capricious treatment of international students studying in the united states during the covid- pandemic. young people around the world dream of coming to the united states, especially to study, innovate, and contribute to our research institutions, our economy, and our communities. winning the competition for talents is a major component for winning global competitions in the 21st century. democrats are committed to policies that make the united states welcoming to the more than one million international students who come to study in our colleges and universities annually, contributing to our higher education sector and to our nation's intellectual and cultural vibrancy. we will act to restore trust and certainty for international students and the higher education sector as part of the recovery from the covid- pandemic and the trump administration's harmful policies toward international students. providing borrowers relief from crushing student debt student debt is holding millions of americans back. the covid- pandemic and president trump’s recession are making it harder for those with student loans to make ends meet right now. democrats will work to authorize up to $, in student debt relief per borrower to help families weather this crisis. beyond that immediate relief, democrats will also take steps to ease the burden of high monthly student loan payments through legislative and administration relief processes, including creating a simplified repayment process. democrats will work to pause monthly billing and stop interest from accruing on federal student loans for people earning less than $,, and cap payments at no more than five percent of discretionary income for those earning more than $,. after years, remaining federal student loan debt should be automatically forgiven without tax liability. for those earning less than $,, we support forgiving all undergraduate tuition-related federal student debt from two- and four-year public colleges and universities, and we will also apply this benefit to individuals holding federal student loans for tuition from private hbcus and msis. democrats support modernizing and improving the public service loan forgiveness program, including making the enrollment process automatic for people who work in schools, government agencies, and non-profit organizations. we will also make the program more generous by forgiving up to $, in student debt per year for up to five years, and apply this action to people who have already dedicated years or less of service to working in our schools, government agencies, and non-profit organizations. we reject republican proposals that, in the name of simplification, would make students pay billions of dollars more on their student loans. not only will these measures make it easier for americans to buy a home or start a small business, student debt forgiveness is key to helping address the racial wealth gap, as students of color are more likely to have to borrow to finance higher education. democrats will also empower the cfpb to take action against exploitative lenders and will work with congress to allow student debt to be discharged during bankruptcy. the trump administration has let for-profit colleges and universities once again prey upon students with impunity by repealing important protections. democrats will crack down on predatory for-profit higher education programs, including by issuing requirements that these programs be able to demonstrate their value and effectiveness before becoming eligible for federal student loans. we will call upon the secretary of education to forgive debt carried by students who were ripped off by predatory schools, including by programs that defrauded students or that misrepresented program offerings or program outcomes, as well as debt held by people who are permanently disabled. and we will protect veterans and servicemembers from being steered into low-performing for-profit higher education and professional programs. renewing american leadership democrats believe that we can only be strong in the world when we are strong and united at home. we believe that a healthy democracy, just society, and inclusive economy are essential prerequisites for effective american leadership abroad. and we believe that the ultimate measure —and purpose—of our foreign policy is whether it protects and advances america’s security, prosperity and values —and delivers results for all americans. president trump promised he would put “america first”—but trump’s america stands alone. under his leadership, america’s reputation and influence are in tatters. our country is less safe, our economy more fragile, and our democracy, values, and unity endangered. rather than advance our interests and values in a more competitive world, president trump has retreated —allowing our adversaries to fill the void. he has attacked the sources of our strength, hollowed out american diplomacy, shredded international commitments, weakened our alliances, and tarnished our credibility. rather than make smart investments to keep our military’s competitive edge, president trump has wasted billions on vanity projects, barred patriotic americans from serving their country, denied military families the care and support they have earned, and tried to use our women and men in uniform to sow fear and division. rather than help americans compete in the global economy, he’s launched reckless, politically-motivated tariff wars that have punished american workers, antagonized our allies, and benefited our adversaries. rather than end our forever wars, he’s brought us to the brink of new conflicts, and further militarized our foreign policy. rather than reduce nuclear dangers, he’s amplified them, and brought the world closer to catastrophe. rather than stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our allies and partners, he’s betrayed them. rather than defend democracy and human rights, he’s fawned over autocrats, sent love letters to despots, sided with dictators over peaceful protestors, and invited foreign interference in our elections. rather than root out corruption, he’s made common cause with kleptocrats. rather than fight the existential threat of climate change, he’s denied science and accelerated the damage. in every region and on every issue, american security and interests are at greater peril— and our rivals at greater advantage—than four years ago. democrats believe four more years of donald trump will damage our influence beyond repair. but closing the chapter on “america first” is just the beginning of the work ahead. we must meet the world as it is today, not as it was before president trump’s destruction. that’s why we cannot simply aspire to restore american leadership. we must reinvent it for a new era. we will revitalize the power and purpose of american diplomacy to compete in a more contested world. we will lead not just with the example of our power, but with the power of our example. we will place values at the center of our foreign policy. and we will reinvent alliances, partnerships, and international institutions to meet common challenges that no country can face on its own. the world today looks very different from the post-wwii period that gave birth to our alliance system. but these changes make our alliances more—not less—crucial to our success. we will ensure that our military has no peer. we owe it to our men and women in uniform and to the american public to spend our defense dollars more wisely and strategically —focused on building a force that can deter and win the conflicts of the 21st century. and we will use force only when necessary, always as a last resort, and with the informed consent of the american people. and, most importantly, democrats will ensure that the reinvention of american leadership abroad prioritizes and accelerates our renewal at home. we will root a disciplined foreign policy in the needs and aspirations of the american middle class and the imperative of building a more dynamic, fair, and resilient society— the ultimate wellspring of our power. revitalizing american diplomacy democrats will revitalize american diplomacy to ensure that the united states remains the world’s pivotal power and a principled force for peace and prosperity. the united states should be at the head of the table whenever the safety and well-being of americans is at stake, working in common cause with our allies and partners. time and again, the trump administration has stormed out, leaving america’s seat at the table vacant and american interests on the menu. americans deserve better. rebuilding america’s tool of first resort democrats believe that diplomacy should be our tool of first resort. the world’s greatest power deserves to have the world’s very best diplomatic corps. but today, american diplomacy is badly adrift and under resourced, and our diplomats are demoralized. democrats will support and invest in long overdue reforms to make the state department more strategic, modern, agile, and effective. rather than militarize our foreign policy, treat our diplomats with contempt, and call for reckless budget cuts, democrats will put diplomacy back in the hands of professionals and ensure they are better prepared to advance american interests on the central issues of our time, like disruptive technology and climate change. we will recruit a new generation of americans who want to serve their country abroad and ensure they have the training and tools they need. and we will expand and reform the foreign service so it reflects the diversity and richness of the country it represents. reinventing alliances democrats believe america’s alliances are an irreplaceable cornerstone of our national security that should be cultivated, not cast away. our allies offer an enormous strategic advantage that our rivals can’t match. they multiply our influence, spread our reach, lighten our burden, and advance our shared interests and priorities much farther than we could ever do on our own. president trump has undermined our alliances in ways that our adversaries could have only dreamed of—sowing doubts about our commitments to diplomatic agreements, mutual defense, democratic values, and strategic purpose. as a result, our alliance system today faces its biggest test since the end of the cold war. he has pushed to bring russia back into the g7 while lambasting our nato partners and ignoring intelligence about russian bounties for killing american troops and other coalition forces in afghanistan. he has undermined confidence in america’s commitment to the alliance’s article mutual defense provision, and threatened to pull troops out of germany without consultation. in the midst of a nuclear crisis on the korean peninsula, he tried to extort our south korean allies to dramatically increase their share of alliance costs. democrats will not only repair our alliances, but reinvent them to advance mutual priorities and deal with new challenges. we believe our alliances are strongest when they are rooted in shared democratic values. that’s why we need to signal clearly our profound concerns about democratic backsliding in a number of ally states, and why we need to work with allied democracies to end democracy’s global recession. we will make developing shared responses to non-military threats like disinformation, corruption, and economic coercion, priorities in our agenda. we will work with our partners to improve interoperability, and we will encourage them to build up their defense capabilities, take greater responsibility for regional security, and contribute their fair share. but we will never treat our alliances like protection rackets. democrats will not only reinvent existing alliances but also work to strengthen and build new partnerships in regions of growing strategic importance, particularly in africa and latin america. international institutions democrats believe that american security and prosperity are enhanced when the united states leads in shaping the rules, forging the agreements, and steering the institutions that guide international relations. we believe the system of international institutions we built and led over the past seven decades has generated an enormous return on our investment. and in today’s more competitive world, its renovation is a critical diplomatic priority. unfortunately, president trump has orchestrated an american retreat from global bodies that weakens our influence, cedes ground to our adversaries, and puts global peace and prosperity in jeopardy. instead of walking away, democrats believe the united states should lead the way and mobilize our partners to work in common cause. we will rejoin and reform the who, the united nations human rights council, and the united nations population fund, because in a global public health crisis and a global democratic recession, american leadership is needed more than ever. we will work to modernize international institutions to make sure they are fit for purpose in the 21st century and responsible stewards of both public funds and the world’s trust. foreign assistance and development democrats believe that foreign assistance and development programs are powerful tools for promoting american, and global, security and prosperity. with less than one percent of its annual budget, the united states gets an extraordinary return on its investments in the prevention and alleviation of poverty, hunger, disease, and conflict, the empowerment of vulnerable and marginalized populations, and the opening of global markets for american business and exports to thrive. that’s why we will ensure that the u.s. agency for international development (usaid) reclaims its position as the world’s premier development agency. and it’s why we reject the trump administration’s punitive and transactional approach to foreign aid and its use to advance domestic political errands at the expense of our national interests. democrats will devote the resources and implement the reforms necessary to further multiply the impact of foreign assistance. we will reaffirm america’s commitment to the united nations sustainable development goals and promote data efforts and transparency measures that ensure accountability and help identify areas for strategic investment. we will incorporate local perspectives, including from civil society partners, into the design, execution, and evaluation of our programs to secure lasting impact. and we will provide the budgetary support and statutory authorities necessary to make sure our aid institutions, including the new u.s. international development finance corporation, are successfully integrated into broader international and private-sector development efforts. democrats will lead international efforts to help developing countries withstand and recover from debt crises caused by the covid- pandemic, and we will push for international standards that establish more transparency and sustainability in development financing. transforming our armed forces for the 21st century democrats believe our military is—and must be—the most effective fighting force in the world. to keep it that way, we need to bring our forever wars to a responsible end, rationalize our defense budget, invest in the forces and technologies of the future, repair civil-military relations, and strengthen our covenant with service members, veterans, and military families. ending forever wars democrats know it’s time to bring nearly two decades of unceasing conflict to an end. our military engagements, which have spanned from west africa to southeast asia, have cost more than $ trillion and claimed more than half a million lives. our war in afghanistan is the longest war in american history, with the youngest u.s. troops now fighting a war that was launched before they were even born. president trump said he would get the united states out of these wars, but instead he deployed more combat forces, expanded their missions, and stoked regional tensions that unnecessarily endangered american lives and interests. democrats will deliver on this overdue commitment to end the forever wars, and we will do it responsibly —setting priorities, leading with diplomacy, protecting ourselves from terrorist threats, enabling local partners, and bringing our troops home. democrats are committed to a durable and inclusive political settlement in afghanistan that ensures that al-qaeda isn’t allowed to reconstitute, the islamic state (isis) isn’t allowed to grow, and the international community can help afghans safeguard hard-fought gains, especially for women and girls. democrats will end support for the saudi-led war in yemen and help bring the war to an end. this war is responsible for the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, and it amplifies threats to the region and to our interests. democrats believe that the united states should support diplomatic efforts—not block them. democrats will not only end the wars that have cost so much american blood and treasure—we will apply their lessons. we will only use force when necessary to protect national security and when the objective is clear and achievable —with the informed consent of the american people, and where warranted, the approval of congress. that is why we will work with congress to repeal decades-old authorizations for the use of military force and replace them with a narrow and specific framework that will ensure we can protect americans from terrorist threats while ending the forever wars. rather than occupy countries and overthrow regimes to prevent terrorist attacks, democrats will prioritize more effective and less costly diplomatic, intelligence, and law enforcement tools. we will right-size our counterterrorism footprint, put it in service of broader regional and overarching foreign policy objectives, and ensure it never undermines the values we seek to uphold. and we will mobilize our partners to make sustained investments that can prevent conflict and help extinguish the flames on which extremists feed. securing our competitive edge democrats believe the united states military should be the best-trained, best-equipped, and most effective fighting force in the world. ending the forever wars, reducing the enormous stress on our forces, and rationalizing our global military footprint are essential prerequisites to securing our competitive edge—but they’re not enough. we will invest in technology and forces that meet the threats of the future—from cyber to space, and artificial intelligence to unmanned systems— and reinforce the alliances and partnerships that enhance our collective security. rather than continuing to rely on legacy platforms that are increasingly exposed and vulnerable, democrats support funding a more cost-effective, agile, flexible, and resilient force with modern transportation and logistics capabilities that can operate in more contested environments. democrats will accelerate defense transformation in a responsible, ethical way, and with strong privacy protections. and we believe the implications of climate change for national security and the department of defense can no longer be an afterthought, but must be at the core of all policy and operational plans to secure our vital interests. defense spending democrats believe the measure of our security is not how much we spend on defense, but how we spend our defense dollars and in what proportion to other tools in our foreign policy toolbox and other urgent domestic investments. we believe we can and must ensure our security while restoring stability, predictability, and fiscal discipline in defense spending. we spend times more on the military than we do on diplomacy. we spend five times more in afghanistan each year than we do on global public health and preventing the next pandemic. we can maintain a strong defense and protect our safety and security for less. it’s past time to rebalance our investments, improve the efficiency and competitiveness of our defense industrial base, conduct rigorous annual audits of the pentagon, and end waste and fraud. keeping faith with our veterans and military families democrats believe that our force is stronger when it reflects the richness and diversity of american society, and when we treat our service members, veterans, and their families with the dignity they’ve earned. we will protect and enhance opportunities for anyone who can meet the standards to serve in combat roles, and we will fight the scourge of rape and sexual assault in our military, end retaliation and impunity, and take care of survivors. we will reverse the trump administration’s hateful transgender ban, discriminatory exclusions in military health care, and policies that stigmatize and discriminate against people living with hiv and aids, and ensure that lgbtq+ service members and families enjoy equal respect, benefits, and care. we will root out systemic racism from our military justice system, where black service members are twice as likely as white ones to face court-martial. we will accelerate efforts to recruit and promote people of color in the officer corps. we believe that service members, veterans, and their spouses should never face deportation. we will create a parole process for veterans deported by the trump administration to reunite them with their families and compatriots. and we believe anyone who has served honorably in our military has earned a path to citizenship prior to discharge or retirement. democrats believe that the world’s best fighting force and its veterans deserve the world’s best health care. we will rebuild trust in, and accountability at, the va —not privatize it. we will modernize va facilities and bolster funding to the va as part of a nationwide infrastructure plan, expand eligibility for va benefits so that all veterans can access the va, and work with congress to eliminate va cop-pays for preventive health care for veterans. we will ensure that va benefits address the full needs of our women veterans, including reproductive services, and that every veteran receives comprehensive and culturally competent care and benefits regardless of their ethnicity, race, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and eliminate transgender exclusions. we will combat veteran homelessness, including by converting va facilities into housing. twenty veterans and service members take their life every day. we will treat suicide as the public health crisis it is. today, only half of afghanistan and iraq veterans have access to the mental health services they need. that’s why we will invest in mental health and suicide prevention services, and work with our military communities to encourage and support those seeking help, connecting them to critical services. democrats will provide the hundreds of thousands of service members that transition to civilian life with the support they need. democrats will not abide exploitation of our veterans, especially by for-profit colleges that raid benefits and burden veterans with debt. democrats believe that we can’t maintain the force we need unless we take care of military families— who have been asked to endure so much for so long, with far too little support. no military family should struggle to pay their bills, put food on the table, or access health care, quality housing, child care, or the workforce. we will ensure pay and compensation keep pace with the current economy. we will also increase time between deployments, improve educational outcomes for military children, and invest in career training, education, and entrepreneurship programs for military spouses, who face an unemployment rate twice the national average. we will expand tax credits to help family caregivers of our veterans, and ensure they receive the support they need from the va and department of defense. and we will support efforts across the country to help veterans and military families thrive, enrich, and strengthen their communities and our nation. civil-military relations democrats believe that healthy civil-military relations are essential to our democracy and to the strength and effectiveness of our military. we will end the trump administration’s politicization of the armed forces and distortion of civilian and military roles in decision-making. we will reinstate national security policymaking processes that advance competent civilian control and appropriately incorporate military advice —not issue commands by tweet. we will safeguard the independence of the military justice system —not pardon war criminals. democrats will hold regular press briefings to explain the legal and policy justifications for military operations, because transparency and open debate with congress and the american public are necessary for democratic accountability. democrats will never use active duty soldiers as political props, and we will never send military forces to suppress americans exercising their constitutional rights. mobilizing the world to address transnational challenges global health and pandemics the human and economic toll of the covid- pandemic underscores the urgency of strengthening the global public health system —and the consequences of america’s disengagement from the world. the trump administration was warned about the clear and present danger of a global pandemic. the administration not only ignored the threat but dismantled our early warning and response mechanisms and failed to act when the pandemic began. we owe it to all those whose lives have been shattered by this disease to learn from that fatal mistake. democrats will take overdue steps to ensure our government is not caught off guard by public health threats, at home or abroad. we will revitalize and expand the obama-biden administration’s global health security agenda, and we will immediately restore the white house national security council directorate for global health security and biodefense. democrats will also mobilize allies, partners, and international institutions to develop a more robust and effective global public health system. we will work to help the united nations improve its facilitation efforts in public health crises, and we will establish a global health emergency board to harmonize crisis response for vulnerable communities. rather than undercutting the who and undermining its work on the frontlines of global pandemic response, democrats will ensure the united states remains its leading funder and technical partner. democrats will fully resource the who, especially its contingency fund for emergencies, while supporting fundamental reforms and mechanisms to enhance accountability and protect experts from political pressure. we support the development of a vaccine accelerator to ensure rapid, equitable, and affordable global access to vaccines, therapeutics, and supplies. democrats know that effective global health policy saves lives at home and around the world. beyond its immediate damage, the covid- pandemic has badly disrupted routine, life-saving vaccinations, putting million children around the world at greater risk of dying from preventable diseases. we will reaffirm our commitment to the president’s emergency plan for aids relief and help realize the promise of an aids-free generation. and we will help the world eradicate tuberculosis, malaria, and polio, as well as preventable maternal and childhood deaths. climate change democrats recognize that the united states does not stand alone in the fight against climate change and global environmental degradation. we will fully integrate climate change into our foreign policy and national security strategies, and we will restore u.s. global climate leadership. democrats will immediately rejoin the paris climate agreement, commit the united states to doing its fair share and lead the world in the effort to keep global warming to . degrees celsius, and convene a world summit aimed at new and more ambitious global targets to reduce greenhouse gas pollution. we will revive and expand climate-related foreign assistance including by recommitting to the green climate fund. we will protect our oceans—vital buffers against the impacts of climate change— through fisheries management programs and additional designations of marine protected areas. we will seek collaborative, science-based approaches to be good stewards of the rapidly changing arctic region, while protecting our strategic interests. we will work to ratify the kigali amendment to the montreal protocol and move expeditiously to phase out super-polluting hydrofluorocarbons in the united states. we will restore funding to the global environment facility and the intergovernmental panel on climate change, to support critical climate science research around the world. we will support the protection of species and wildlife habitats around the world, including by advancing the goals of the united nations framework convention on biological diversity, and encourage other countries to join us in conserving percent of the planet by . democrats will also work with world leaders to catalyze increased global investments in clean energy solutions and climate resilience, including to help low-income countries move along a more sustainable development path. we will promote climate accountability and mobilize a united front to keep states like china from outsourcing pollution to other countries. democrats believe that executing a strategy of bold climate leadership will require sustained focus and increased expertise across our foreign policy institutions. we will incorporate climate issues as key priorities at the department of state, the department of defense, and in the intelligence community. and we will ensure that america’s service missions abroad, including those executed through the peace corps and usaid, expand their calls to action to include reducing carbon pollution, safeguarding indigenous peoples and vulnerable populations from climate impacts, and guaranteeing a more sustainable planet for all. technology democrats believe that american diplomatic leadership is critical to maximizing the benefits of technological innovation while minimizing its risks and dislocations. we have a stake in bridging the gap between the pace of innovation and the development of rules of the road governing the most consequential domains of technology, from cyberspace to artificial intelligence to synthetic biology. democrats will avoid a race to the bottom, where countries hostile to democratic values shape our future. instead, we will mobilize public and private actors to ensure that new products and new discoveries are bound by law, ethics, and civil liberties protections that enable democratic societies to thrive and prosperity to be shared broadly. we will recommit the united states to the principles of an open internet, including net neutrality, and vigorously oppose efforts to digitally silo off countries and populations from the rest of the world. democrats believe that algorithms and platforms should empower people instead of the surveillance state. we expect technology companies and social media platforms to take responsibility and do more to preserve the openness of democratic societies and identify foreign disinformation, especially including paid efforts to influence american elections through advertising or coordinated inauthentic behavior, and we will take steps to prevent the use of new technologies to facilitate repression, spread hate, or incite violence. democrats recognize that the security of data is only becoming more vital across all threads of technological progress. that’s why we will work with our allies and partners to develop secure 5g networks and address threats in cyberspace. democrats will maintain american capabilities that can deter cyber threats, and we will work with other countries—and the private sector—to protect individuals’ data and defend critical infrastructure, including the global financial system. we will also work to make sure that the revolution in biotechnology remains a force for global good. we will promote international efforts to responsibly and ethically manage research in areas like gene editing. we will sustain and improve international collaboration and data-sharing. and we will ensure equitable access to medical treatments and vaccines generated by new biotech discoveries. democrats will partner with other countries and private companies to build up capacity and implement appropriate safety standards for any work that involves dangerous pathogens, and we remain staunchly committed to the international prohibition on the development or use of biological weapons. nonproliferation democrats believe the united states has a moral responsibility and national security imperative to prevent the spread of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, and eventually secure their elimination. over the past four years, the trump administration has done precisely the opposite. its brash nuclear threats, ill-considered withdrawals from critical arms control treaties and nuclear agreements, and reckless embrace of a new arms race have made the united states, and the world, less safe. thanks to president trump’s abdication of leadership, the nuclear dangers that americans face are greater than they have been in decades. democrats reject a return to an old era of grave nuclear dangers. democrats believe that the sole purpose of our nuclear arsenal should be to deter—and, if necessary, retaliate against—a nuclear attack, and we will work to put that belief into practice, in consultation with our allies and military. we will work to maintain a strong, credible deterrent while reducing our overreliance and excessive expenditure on nuclear weapons. the trump administration’s proposal to build new nuclear weapons is unnecessary, wasteful, and indefensible. democrats commit to strengthening the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, maintaining the moratorium on explosive nuclear weapons testing, pushing for the ratification of the un arms trade treaty and comprehensive test ban treaty, and extending new start. just as was the case during the height of the cold war, it’s in our interest to work with russia to verifiably limit and reduce our nuclear stockpiles. we will build on this foundation to negotiate arms control agreements that reflect the emergence of new players like china, capture new technologies, and move the world back from the nuclear precipice. terrorism so long as violent extremists continue to plot attacks on our homeland and our interests, democrats will maintain a vigilant focus on counterterrorism. democrats recognize that the threat landscape has evolved dramatically since september . our counterterrorism priorities, strategies, footprint, and tools should shift accordingly, including to respond to the growing threat from white supremacist and other right-wing terrorist groups democrats will sustain the global effort to defeat isis, al-qaeda, and their affiliates. we will ensure that the world is equally committed to the difficult task that follows military success: dealing with the underlying conditions that allowed violent extremism to flourish in the first place. we will work with our partners to prioritize diplomatic, law enforcement, and intelligence tools, to reinforce our objectives instead of distorting them. democrats believe that our rhetoric, policies, and tactics—and those of our counterterrorism partners—should never serve as terrorist recruiting tools. we will always work to avoid civilian casualties, and we will not weaponize counterterrorism for anti-immigrant purposes. we will reject the targeting of muslim, arab, and other racial and ethnic communities based on their faith and backgrounds at home and abroad. we will close the detention center at guantanamo bay, enhance transparency, oversight, and accountability in counterterrorism programs and operations, and safeguard civil liberties and the rule of law. democracy and human rights around the world, democracy and human rights are under greater assault than they have been in a generation. under president trump, the united states has too often been part of the assault and too rarely engaged in the defense and promotion of universal values. democrats believe that the fight for universal values should start at home, but it can’t end there. global democratic backsliding and the erosion of human rights put our interests and values at risk. that’s why the reinvention of american leadership demands we put democratic values at the core of our foreign policy, with renewed strategies and tools for a new era. democrats will make gender equality a key foreign policy priority and work to achieve gender parity across our national security team. we will implement the women, peace, and security act because advancing gender equality enhances stability and economic prosperity around the world. along with our diplomatic partners, we will incorporate more women into peace processes —where their participation can improve the odds of a peace agreement holding— and ensure women’s leadership in peace and security processes globally. democrats will lead international efforts to address the scourge of gender-based violence, and we will work to ratify the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. we will push for greater participation by women in the global workforce, which studies show can boost global gdp by percent. democrats will always protect sexual and reproductive health and rights. we believe that comprehensive health services, including access to reproductive care and abortion services, are vital to the empowerment of women and girls. we will support the repeal of the global gag rule (also known as the mexico city policy) and measures like the helms amendment, which limit safe access to abortion. we will also restore and expand american contributions to the united nations population fund to help guarantee access to health care for women and children around the world and eliminate child, early, and forced marriage. democrats will advance the ability of all persons to live with dignity, security, and respect, regardless of who they are or who they love. we will restore the united states’ position of leadership on lgbtq+ issues by passing the globe act and appointing senior leaders directly responsible for driving and coordinating lgbtq+ issues at the state department, usaid, and the national security council. we will ensure that our immigration policies account for the needs of lgbtq+ refugees and asylum seekers, and that we use the full slate of human rights promotion and accountability tools to defend the universal rights of lgbtq+ people. we will amplify the voices of lgbtq+ persons around the world and counter violence and discrimination against lgbtq+ persons wherever it appears. democrats will stand up for and support civil society around the world. crackdowns on civic space in recent years have undermined democracy, the rule of law, and the vibrancy and health of societies. as autocrats leverage technology and employ arbitrary legal measures to shrink civic space, the united states should lead the world in adapting and bolstering support for civic activism. democrats believe that the united states should defend freedom of the press. independent media is not the enemy of the people, but the guardian of democracy. we will push back against erosion of press freedom wherever it occurs and in whatever form—whether through direct intimidation of, and violence against, journalists or legal, regulatory, and financial pressures that smother free speech. we will fight human trafficking and strive to end the practice of modern-day slavery around the world. we will aggressively leverage u.s. law enforcement and strengthen diplomatic efforts to combat forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation. and we will increase visas for victims of human trafficking at a time when mass migration has affected so many vulnerable communities. democrats believe that improving labor standards around the world protects human rights and promotes broad-based prosperity. we will ensure that america’s diplomatic and trade agreements include enforcement provisions for workers’ rights, and we will fight to end the evils of poverty-wage, child, and slave labor. we believe that american workers should not be undercut by foreign competition that relies on the abuse of workers, and we will support the rights of unions and workers abroad to organize, including international labor organization conventions supporting freedom of association and collective bargaining. democrats believe that america should be a world leader when it comes to disability rights. we will work to ratify the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities, and we will appoint a special envoy for international disability rights. across american diplomatic and development efforts, we will ensure that programs are disability-inclusive, and we will encourage partner countries and international organizations to address the needs of persons with disabilities. democrats believe that freedom of religion and the right to believe—or not to believe—are fundamental human rights. we will never use protection of that right as a cover for discrimination. we reject the politicization of religious freedom in american foreign policy, and we condemn atrocities against religious minorities around the world—from isis’ genocide of christians and yezidis, to china’s mass internment of uyghurs and other ethnic minorities, to burma’s persecution of the rohingya, to attacks on religious minorities in northeast syria. democrats believe that the united states should serve as a model for countries around the world when it comes to safeguarding and promoting the rights of indigenous peoples. we will reaffirm the obama-biden administration's support for, and strive to advance the principles of, the united nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples. consistent with the declaration, the united states should urge the united nations and the organization of american states to create mechanisms that include the formal participation of tribal nations. democrats will work to secure a better future for younger generations. roughly percent of the world’s population is under , and the proportion of young people is even higher in the developing world. democrats will ensure that our policies, and those of our partners and development institutions, work to increase economic opportunities, expand education, and improve health care for young people around the world. and we will pay special attention to protecting the rights of youth and nurturing young leaders from vulnerable or underrepresented communities. democrats believe that the united states has an urgent, moral obligation and strategic interest to help alleviate suffering around the globe. entrenched conflicts and unprecedented levels of forced migration have pushed the world into an acute humanitarian crisis that spills across borders. this year, almost million people are going to need humanitarian assistance. by that figure could top million, and need is poised to continue outstripping growth in humanitarian funding and capacity. democrats will reassert america’s humanitarian example and leadership. we will contribute not just more aid, but better aid. the united states ought to drive the international community in providing more strategic, coordinated, proactive, predictable, and cost-effective funding —and in implementing programs that both reflect the realities of today’s increasingly complex and protracted humanitarian emergencies, and deliver on the health, education, and protection needs of populations devastated by conflict and displacement. in the midst of the worst forced displacement crisis since wwii, the trump administration launched a campaign to undermine the global system that provides crucial assistance to refugees and the countries that give them safe harbor. democrats will end the trump administration’s shameful efforts to close doors to the world’s most vulnerable. we will reverse discriminatory bans and policies that deny protection to groups based on their religion, gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity. we will significantly raise the annual global refugee admissions target, and work with congress to create a minimum annual number for refugee admissions, while expanding and identifying new pathways for refugees to seek safe havens. admitting refugees is not only the right thing to do —it’s the smart thing to do. bringing in those seeking a better life helps preserve the stability of america’s partners abroad, strengthens our hand in getting other countries to uphold their obligations, grows our own economy, and enriches our society. democrats believe that torture is immoral and ineffective. president trump’s fondness for torture and other war crimes only gives fodder to america’s enemies. democrats will immediately reaffirm the obama-biden administration’s ban on torture and commit to upholding american values at home and abroad. we will condemn the mistreatment of imprisoned individuals wherever it occurs, and we will hold to account those who perpetrate human rights abuses. advancing american interests global economy and trade democrats will fight for every american job and will make sure american workers have a fair shot in the global economy. for too long, the global trading system has failed to keep its promises to american workers. too many corporations have rushed to outsource jobs, and too many countries have reneged on commitments to be honest and transparent partners. we will not negotiate any new trade deals before first investing in american competitiveness at home. we will aggressively enforce existing trade laws and agreements. and we will insist on strong and enforceable standards for labor, human rights, and the environment in any future trade agreements, so that they build the american middle class, create jobs, raise wages, and strengthen our communities. we will use all tools at our disposal to take action against countries that steal american intellectual property or manipulate their currencies to get an unfair advantage in international markets. democrats believe that if the united states does not work with its allies and partners to shape the terms of global trade, china will shape them for us —and american working families and the middle class will pay the price. that’s why we will work with our allies to mobilize more than half the world’s economy to stand up to china and negotiate from the strongest possible position. democrats believe that fighting for american workers also means pushing back against global corruption, and we will make anti-corruption a priority in our foreign policy. the trump administration’s own shady dealings and its enthusiasm for authoritarianism abroad have only emboldened the world’s autocrats and kleptocrats. democrats will implement new transparency measures aimed at preventing illicit money from flowing through the american financial system, including a ban on anonymous shell companies, expansions of anti-money laundering requirements, disclosure of beneficial ownership, and greater oversight of cross-border transactions. we will combat bribery abroad by expanding on the foreign corrupt practices act, and we will deploy the full range of america’s diplomatic and economic tools to target kleptocrats —including targeted sanctions and visa bans. when used strategically—as one of the tools employed, alongside our allies, to achieve clear policy objectives—financial and economic sanctions are an effective way to advance many core u.s. national security objectives. but when misused and overused, sanctions not only undermine our interests, they threaten one of the united states’ greatest strategic assets: the importance of the american financial system. democrats will guard against the improper application of economic and financial sanctions that incentivize foreign businesses to bypass our financial system, corrode the power and potential of sanctions, undercut the potential of our diplomacy, hurt our economy, and threaten the key role of the u.s. dollar as the world’s reserve currency. africa democrats will revitalize our partnerships across africa to unleash enormous potential for growth and innovation and address together challenges and stresses across the continent. africa is home to some of the world’s fastest growing economies. its population will roughly double to more than two billion by the middle of this century, and nigeria is projected to have the third largest population in the world. american diplomacy can play a critical role in helping ensure that the region’s vulnerabilities to climate change and pandemic disease—and persistent challenges of regional conflict, illicit financial flows, poor governance, and food, water, and health insecurity—do not overwhelm its enormous opportunities. at a moment when u.s.-africa ties are increasingly important to our interests and our economy, and when our friends and rivals are investing more resources and diplomatic attention across the continent, the trump administration has treated africa and its people with neglect and contempt. we will repair our relationships with african partners and publics, renewing our commitment to fight for democracy and human rights; advance peace and security; bolster economic growth and public health; and promote clean energy, sustainable agriculture, environmental protection, and decent work for all with special regard for youth and women. democrats will recommit to the obama-biden administration’s national strategy for combating wildlife trafficking and ban importation into the united states of hunting trophies from africa’s iconic and endangered big cats. democrats will seize opportunities to strengthen fragile political transitions in sudan and ethiopia while deepening relations with key partners. we will not shirk from our longstanding pledge to assist countries in central africa, the sahel, and the horn of africa to counter extremism and address root causes of insecurity. we will support the implementation of the african union’s african continental free trade agreement and its agenda and promote a multi-faceted economic engagement focused on increasing two-way and regional trade, promoting investment and partnership in key industries. and we will assist in africa’s recovery from the covid- pandemic while expanding efforts to improve the resiliency of health systems across the continent. moreover, we will stand in solidarity with our african counterparts against structural racism in the united states and abroad, and commit to elevate african voices in multilateral forums to solve the world’s most pressing problems. americas democrats believe the western hemisphere is america’s strategic home base —a region bound together by common values, history, and vision of a more prosperous, democratic, and secure future. when the united states hosts the region’s leaders at next year’s summit of the americas—the first to be held here since the inaugural meeting in miami—we will turn the page on the trump administration’s denigration and extortion of our neighbors, and we will chart a new era of cooperation based on partnership and shared responsibility for the region we all call home. democrats will reaffirm the importance of north america to u.s. global economic competitiveness. we will ensure the usmca lives up to its commitment to create prosperity for american workers, and we will strictly enforce compliance with its labor and environmental provisions. we will reinvigorate and build upon the north american plan for animal and pandemic influenza launched under the obama-biden administration and work with our partners to recover from the covid- pandemic, which has caused the biggest economic decline in history across latin america and the caribbean. rather than coerce our neighbors into supporting cruel migration policies, we will work with our regional and international partners to address the root causes of migration—violence and insecurity, weak rule of law, lack of educational and economic opportunity, pervasive corruption, and environmental degradation. rather than encourage climate denial and environmental devastation, we will rally the world to protect the amazon from deforestation, protect indigenous peoples, and help vulnerable nations in the caribbean and central america adapt to the impacts of climate change. and rather than imitate populist demagogues, we will link arms with our neighbors to realize our shared aspirations for the region’s future. we will reject president trump’s failed venezuela policy, which has only served to entrench nicolás maduro’s dictatorial regime and exacerbate a human rights and humanitarian crisis. to rise to the occasion of the world’s worst refugee crisis and worst humanitarian crisis outside a warzone in decades, the united states will mobilize its partners across the region and around the world to meet the urgent needs of the people of venezuela, and grant temporary protected status to venezuelans in the united states. democrats believe that the best opportunity to rescue venezuela’s democracy is through smart pressure and effective diplomacy, not empty, bellicose threats untethered to realistic policy goals and motivated by domestic partisan objectives. democrats will also move swiftly to reverse trump administration policies that have undermined u.s. national interests and harmed the cuban people and their families in the united states, including its efforts to curtail travel and remittances. rather than strengthening the regime, we will promote human rights and people-to-people exchanges, and empower the cuban people to write their own future. asia-pacific as a pacific power, the united states should work closely with its allies and partners to advance our shared prosperity, security, and values —and shape the unfolding pacific century. democrats’ approach to china will be guided by america’s national interests and the interests of our allies, and draw on the sources of american strength —the openness of our society, the dynamism of our economy, and the power of our alliances to shape and enforce international norms that reflect our values. undermining those strengths will not make us “tough on china.” it would be a gift to the chinese communist party. democrats will be clear, strong, and consistent in pushing back where we have profound economic, security, and human rights concerns about the actions of china’s government. democrats will protect the american worker from unfair trade practices by the chinese government, including currency manipulation and benefiting from a misaligned exchange rate with the dollar, illegal subsidies, and theft of intellectual property. we will rally friends and allies across the world to push back against china or any other country’s attempts to undermine international norms. democrats believe the china challenge is not primarily a military one, but we will deter and respond to aggression. we will underscore our global commitment to freedom of navigation and resist the chinese military’s intimidation in the south china sea. democrats are committed to the taiwan relations act and will continue to support a peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people of taiwan. rather than stand with president xi jinping as he cracks down on hong kong’s autonomy, democrats will stand for the democratic rights of its citizens. we will fully enforce the hong kong human rights and democracy act, including by sanctioning officials, financial institutions, companies, and individuals responsible for undercutting hong kong’s autonomy. and we will bring the world together to condemn the internment of more than one million uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in concentration camps in china, using the tools provided by the uyghur human rights policy act. democrats will pursue this strategy without resorting to self-defeating, unilateral tariff wars or falling into the trap of a new cold war. those mistakes would only serve to exaggerate china’s weight, over-militarize our policy, and hurt american workers. america must approach our relationship with china with confidence —the confidence to lead international efforts to push back on malign behavior while also pursuing cooperation on issues of mutual interest like climate change and nonproliferation and ensuring that the u.s.-china rivalry does not put global stability at risk. rather than denigrate our partners and encourage tensions between our allies, the united states will work to strengthen ties with and between our key allies in the region, including japan, south korea, and australia, and we will work to ensure that our alliances with thailand and the philippines live up to the values that our peoples share. together with our allies —and through diplomacy with north korea — we will constrain and contain the threat posed by north korea’s nuclear program and its regional belligerence. we will build a sustained, coordinated diplomatic campaign to advance the longer-term goal of denuclearization. and we will not forget the people of north korea— democrats will support humanitarian aid and pressure the regime to cease its gross human rights abuses. we will reinvigorate our commitment to robust engagement with regional multilateral institutions like the association of southeast asian nations, which will help us promote the rule of law and sustainable, inclusive economic growth on both sides of the pacific. and we will continue to invest in our strategic partnership with india—the world’s largest democracy, a nation of great diversity, and a growing asia-pacific power. europe in the years since the fall of the berlin wall, the united states and europe have strived to build a transatlantic community of free and democratic societies that works together to bring peace, prosperity, and dignity to all our citizens. the trump administration has put that dream in grave danger. donald trump either does not know or has forgotten who america’s friends are. he sees europe as a foe—not a friend—of the united states. he sees vladimir putin’s russia as a strategic partner—not a strategic rival. he sees anti-european union, far-right nationalists as political allies—not destructive antagonists. democrats, on the other hand, believe a united, democratic, and prosperous europe is vital to the united states. we believe the transatlantic alliance is the ballast of our global influence. ours is the largest economic relationship in the world, making up nearly half of global gdp. nato is the world’s most formidable military alliance. and together, we stand as champions of universal rights and freedoms around the world. transatlantic cooperation is crucial to addressing almost every global challenge we face. democrats will reinvigorate the transatlantic partnership to repair the damage of the trump era and preempt the risks of broader structural divergence between the u.s. and europe. we will work together with individual european countries and the european union to counter threats to our democracies and enhance shared resilience against corruption and kleptocracy. we will support greater european integration, stronger defense capabilities, and greater energy security. we will enhance our coordination and joint standard setting on technology, trade, and investment, and we will work to boost our post-covid- economic recovery and reduce inequality. democrats will join our european partners in standing up to a revanchist russia. we will not allow moscow to interfere in our democracies or chip away at our resolve. we will reaffirm america’s commitment to nato and defending our allies. we will maintain transatlantic support for ukraine’s reform efforts and its territorial integrity. democrats will lower regional—and global—threats by reinforcing nuclear arms control. we believe europe is our natural partner in managing areas of competition with china and will work to establish common priorities, strategies, and tools. and just as we came together to stand up to communism and respond to global terrorism, we will come together with europe to confront the existential challenge of climate change. middle east turning the page on two decades of large-scale military deployments and open-ended wars in the middle east does not mean the united states will abandon a region where we and our partners still have enduring interests. democrats believe it’s past time, however, to rebalance our tools, engagement, and relationships in the middle east away from military intervention— leading with pragmatic diplomacy to lay the groundwork for a more peaceful, stable, and free region. democrats will call off the trump administration’s race to war with iran and prioritize nuclear diplomacy, de-escalation, and regional dialogue. democrats believe the united states should not impose regime change on other countries and reject that as the goal of u.s. policy toward iran. we believe the joint comprehensive plan of action (jcpoa) remains the best means to verifiably cut off all of iran’s pathways to a nuclear bomb. the trump administration’s unilateral withdrawal from the jcpoa isolated us from our allies and opened the door for iran to resume its march toward a nuclear weapons capacity that the jcpoa had stopped. that’s why returning to mutual compliance with the agreement is so urgent. the nuclear deal was always meant to be the beginning, not the end, of our diplomacy with iran. democrats support a comprehensive diplomatic effort to extend constraints on iran’s nuclear program and address iran’s other threatening activities, including its regional aggression, ballistic missile program, and domestic repression. democrats also believe we need to reset our relations with our gulf partners to better advance our interests and values. the united states has an interest in helping our partners contend with legitimate security threats; we will support their political and economic modernization and encourage efforts to reduce regional tensions. but we have no interest in continuing the blank-check era of the trump administration, or indulging authoritarian impulses, internal rivalries, catastrophic proxy wars, or efforts to roll back political openings across the region. effective relations with the gulf will help us reconnect iraq to its neighbors and protect the country’s stability, security, and sovereignty. democrats support a small, finite, and focused military presence to train our iraqi partners so they can ensure the lasting defeat of isis. we also support keeping up the offensive against isis in syria to prevent it from regaining a foothold, and will stand by kurdish and other critical partners in that fight. we will work to repatriate foreign fighter detainees, and reinvigorate diplomacy to protect the humanitarian needs and human and civil rights of all syrians and find a political resolution for this horrific war. democrats are deeply concerned by the deepening crisis in lebanon and are committed to work with the lebanese people to promote political and economic reform, financial stability, and security. democrats believe a strong, secure, and democratic israel is vital to the interests of the united states. our commitment to israel’s security, its qualitative military edge, its right to defend itself, and the memorandum of understanding is ironclad. democrats recognize the worth of every israeli and every palestinian. that’s why we will work to help bring to an end a conflict that has brought so much pain to so many. we support a negotiated two-state solution that ensures israel’s future as a jewish and democratic state with recognized borders and upholds the right of palestinians to live in freedom and security in a viable state of their own. democrats oppose any unilateral steps by either side—including annexation—that undermine prospects for two states. democrats will continue to stand against incitement and terror. we oppose settlement expansion. we believe that while jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations, it should remain the capital of israel, an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths. democrats will restore u.s.-palestinian diplomatic ties and critical assistance to the palestinian people in the west bank and gaza, consistent with u.s. law. we oppose any effort to unfairly single out and delegitimize israel, including at the united nations or through the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement, while protecting the constitutional right of our citizens to free speech.","['democratic', 'party',

Republican Party,2020,2020,rep_2020.csv,CSV,"Preamble With this platform, we the Republican Party reaffirm the principles that unite us in a common purpose. We believe in American exceptionalism. We believe the United States of America is unlike any other nation on earth. We believe America is exceptional because of our historic role — first as refuge, then as defender, and now as exemplar of liberty for the world to see. We affirm — as did the Declaration of Independence: that all are created equal, endowed by their Creator with inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We believe in the Constitution as our founding document. We believe the Constitution was written not as a flexible document, but as our enduring covenant. We believe our constitutional system — limited government, separation of powers, federalism, and the rights of the people — must be preserved uncompromised for future generations. We believe political freedom and economic freedom are indivisible. When political freedom and economic freedom are separated — both are in peril; when united, they are invincible. We believe that people are the ultimate resource — and that the people, not the government, are the best stewards of our country's God-given natural resources. As Americans and as Republicans we wish for peace — so we insist on strength. We will make America safe. We seek friendship with all peoples and all nations, but we recognize and are prepared to deal with evil in the world. Based on these principles, this platform is an invitation and a roadmap. It invites every American to join us and shows the path to a stronger, safer, and more prosperous America. This platform is optimistic because the American people are optimistic. This platform lays out — in clear language — the path to making America great and united again. For the past 8 years America has been led in the wrong direction. Our economy has become unnecessarily weak with stagnant wages. People living paycheck to paycheck are struggling, sacrificing, and suffering. Americans have earned and deserve a strong and healthy economy. Our standing in world affairs has declined significantly — our enemies no longer fear us and our friends no long trust us. People want and expect an America that is the most powerful and respected country on the face of the earth. The men and women of our military remain the world's best. The have been shortchanged in numbers, equipment, and benefits by a Commander in Chief who treats the Armed Forces and our veterans as a necessary inconvenience. The President and the Democratic party have dismantled Americans' system of healthcare. They have replaced it with a costly and complicated scheme that limits choices and takes away our freedom. The President and the Democratic party have abandoned their promise of being accountable to the American people. They have nearly doubled the size of the national debt. They refuse to control our borders but try to control our schools, farms, businesses, and even our religious institutions. They have directly attacked the production of American energy and the industry-related jobs that have sustained families and communities. The President has been regulating to death a free market economy that he does not like and does not understand. He defies the laws of the United States by refusing to enforce those with which he does not agree. And he appoints judges who legislate from the bench rather than apply the law. We, as Republicans and Americans, cannot allow this to continue. That is why the many sections of this platform affirm our trust in the people, our faith in their judgment, and our determination to help them take back their country. This means removing the power from unelected, unaccountable government. This means relieving the burden and expense of punishing government regulations. And this means returning to the people and the states the control that belongs to them. It is the control and the power to make their own decisions about what’s best for themselves and their families and communities. This platform is many things: A handbook for returning decision-making to the people. A guide to the constitutional rights of every American. And a manual for the kind of sustained growth that will bring opportunity to all those on the sidelines of our society. Every time we sing, ""God Bless America,” we are asking for help. We ask for divine help that our country can fulfill its promise. We earn that help by recommitting ourselves to the ideas and ideals that are the true greatness of America Restoring the American Dream Rebuilding the Economy and Creating Jobs We are the party of a growing economy that gives everyone a chance in life, an opportunity to learn, work, and realize the prosperity freedom makes possible. Government cannot create prosperity, though government can limit or destroy it. Prosperity is the product of self-discipline, enterprise, saving and investment by individuals, but it is not an end in itself. Prosperity provides the means by which citizens and their families can maintain their independence from government, raise their children by their own values, practice their faith, and build communities of cooperation and mutual respect. It is also the foundation for our nation's global leadership, for it is the vigor of our economy which makes possible our military strength and our national security. Pundits and Democrats tell us that we should accept the new normal of a slow-growing economy. The consequences are too dire to ever accept that: President Obama and his party will set a record of being the first modern president ever to leave office without a single calendar year of three percent economic growth. As a result, the number of Americans living in poverty has increased by 7 million, our nation's economy has lost nearly $8 trillion of cumulative output compared with an average recovery, and the economic growth shortfall has left a cumulative real after-tax per person personal income shortfall of nearly $17,000 compared with an average recovery. Under President Obama and the Democrats, new private-sector jobs are three million below where they should have been with just average modern post-recession growth. Our labor force participation rate has plunged to at or below 63 percent for far too long, lows last seen two generations ago before President Reagan was elected in 1980. Business closures have exceeded business startups throughout the Obama Presidency. Strong growth, more jobs, increasing incomes, and expanding opportunity are all in short supply under President Obama and the Democrats. We repudiate the absurd idea this is the best America can do. The American people rejected that nonsense the last time it was offered, in the historic election of 1980, and we ask them to join us now to again repudiate the false gospel of America's di- minishment and retreat. We offer instead our vision of an opportunity society based on the economics of inclusion. Fair and Simple Taxes for Growth Republicans consider the establishment of a pro-growth tax code a moral imperative. More than any other public policy, the way government raises revenue — how much, at what rates, under what circumstances, from whom, and for whom — has the greatest impact on our economy's performance. It powerfully influences the level of economic growth and job creation, which translates into the level of opportunity for those who would otherwise be left behind. Getting our tax system right will be the most important factor in driving the entire economy back to prosperity. The current tax code is rightly the object of both anger and mockery. Its length is exceeded only by its complexity. We must start anew. That will be an enormous undertaking and, if it is to succeed, it must command the attention and approval of the American people. It cannot be engineered from the top down, but must have a common sense approach, and be simplified. Our proposal is straightforward. Wherever tax rates penalize thrift or discourage investment, they must be lowered. Wherever current provisions of the code are disincentives for economic growth, they must be changed. We will not divide the American people into winners and losers. We will eliminate as many special interest provisions and loopholes as possible and curb corporate welfare, especially where their erosion of the tax base has created pressure for higher rates. We will be mindful of the burdens on families with children and the impact on an aging population. We will seek simplicity and clarity so that every taxpayer can understand how much of their income is consumed by the federal government. We will welcome all to this enterprise — to discuss, debate, challenge, and amend — so that together we can restore economic growth for the American people and, even more important, renew their faith in the future. Our Tax Principles To ensure that past abuses will not be repeated, we assert these fundamental principles. We oppose retroactive taxation. We condemn attempts by activist judges at any level of government to seize the power of the purse from the people's elected representatives by ordering higher taxes. We oppose tax policies that deliberately divide Americans or promote class warfare. Because of the vital role of religious organizations, charities, and fraternal benevolent societies in fostering generosity and patriotism, they should not be subject to taxation and donations to them should remain deductible. To guard against hypertaxation of the American people in any restructuring of the federal tax system, any value added tax or national sales tax must be tied to the simultaneous repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment, which established the federal income tax. A Competitive America Competitiveness equals jobs. That equation governs our policies regarding U.S. corporations in the global economy. Private investment is a key driver of economic growth and job creation. After falling dramatically during the recession, private investment has recovered at a disappointing pace due in part to high corporate tax rates and increasing regulatory burdens and uncertainty. American businesses now face the world's highest corporate tax rates. That's like putting lead shoes on your cross-country team. It reduces companies' ability to compete overseas, encourages them to move abroad, lessens their investment, cripples job creation here at home, lowers American wages, and fosters the avoidance of tax liability — without actually increasing tax revenues. A more damaging policy is hard to imagine. We propose to level the international playing field by lowering the corporate tax rate to be on a par with, or below, the rates of other industrial nations. We endorse the recommendation of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, as well as the current Administration's Export Council, to switch to a territorial system of taxation  so that profits earned and taxed abroad may be repatriated for job-creating investment here at home. We believe American companies should be headquartered in America. We should reduce barriers to accomplishing that goal. A Winning Trade Policy International trade is crucial for all sectors of America's economy. Massive trade deficits are not. We envision a worldwide multilateral agreement among nations committed to the principles of open markets, what has been called a “Reagan Economic Zone,” in which free trade will truly be fair trade for all concerned. We need better negotiated trade agreements that put America first. When trade agreements have been carefully negotiated with friendly democracies, they have resulted in millions of new jobs here at home supported by our exports. When those agreements do not adequately protect U.S. interests, U.S. sovereignty, or when they are violated with impunity, they must be rejected. We cannot allow foreign governments to limit American access to their markets while stealing our designs, patents, brands, know-how, and technology. We cannot allow China to continue its currency manipulation, exclusion of U.S. products from government purchases, and subsidization of Chinese companies to thwart American imports. The current Administration's way of dealing with these violations of world trade standards has been a virtual surrender. Republicans understand that you can succeed in a negotiation only if you are willing to walk away from it. A Republican president will insist on parity in trade and stand ready to implement countervailing duties if other countries refuse to cooperate. At the same time, we look to broaden our trade agreements with countries which share our values and commitment to fairness, along with transparency in our commercial and business practices. In pursuing that objective, the American people demand transparency, full disclosure, protection of our national sovereignty, and tough negotiation on the part of those who are supposed to advance the interests of U.S. workers. Significant trade agreements should not be rushed or undertaken in a Lame Duck Congress. Freeing Financial Markets The Republican vision for American banking calls for establishing transparent, efficient markets where consumers can obtain loans they need at reasonable rates based on market conditions. Unfortunately, in response to the financial institutions crisis of 2008-2009, the Democratic-controlled Congress enacted the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, otherwise known as Dodd-Frank. They did not let the crisis go to waste but used it as an excuse to establish unprecedented government control over the nation's financial markets. The consequences have been bad for everyone except federal regulators. Rather than address the cause of the crisis — the government's own housing policies — the new law extended government control over the economy by creating new unaccountable bureaucracies. Predictably, central planning of our financial sector has not created jobs, it has killed them. It has not limited risks, it has created more. It has not encouraged economic growth, it has shackled it. Since the enactment of Dodd-Frank, the number of community banks has significantly declined, and the cost and complexity of complying with the law has created impediments to the remaining banks' ability to support the customers they serve. From 13,000 community banks in 1985, only 1,900 remain. Still, the majority of agricultural loans and small business loans are made by community banks. From start-ups foregone to home loans not made, Dodd-Frank’s excessive regulation and burdensome requirements have helped contribute to the slow economy we all endure today  under President Obama and the Democrats. Community banks are essential to ensuring small businesses have easy and affordable access to the capital they need to grow and prosper. Community banks should be relieved of excessive regulations. We support removing roadblocks and regulations that prevent access to capital. The worst of Dodd-Frank is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, deliberately designed to be a rogue agency. It answers to neither Congress nor the executive, has its own guaranteed funding outside the appropriations process, and uses its slush fund to steer settlements to politically favored groups. Its Director has dictatorial powers unique in the American Republic. Its regulatory harassment of local and regional banks, the source of most home mortgages and small business loans, advantages big banks and makes it harder for Americans to buy a home. Its one-size-fits-all approach to every issue threatens the diversity of the country’s financial system and would leave us with just a few enormous institutions, as in many European countries. If the Bureau is not abolished, it should be subjected to congressional appropriation. In that way, consumer protection in the financial markets can be advanced through measures that are both effective and constitutional. Any settlements arising from statutory violations by financial institutions must be used to make whole the harmed consumers, with any remaining proceeds given to the general Treasury. Diversion of settlement funds to politically- connected parties should be a criminal offense. Republicans believe that no financial institution is too big to fail. We support legislation to ensure that the problems of any financial institution can be resolved through the Bankruptcy Code. We endorse prudent regulation of the banking system to ensure that FDIC-regulated banks are properly capitalized and taxpayers are protected against bailouts. We will end the government’s use of disparate impact theory in enforcing anti-discrimination laws with regard to lending. Responsible Homeownership and Rental Opportunities Homeownership expands personal liberty, builds communities, and helps Americans create wealth. “The American Dream” is not a stale slogan. It is the lived reality that expresses the aspirations of all our people. It means a decent place to live, a safe place to raise kids, a welcoming place to retire. It bespeaks the quiet pride of those who work hard to shelter their family and, in the process, create caring neighborhoods. The Great Recession devastated the housing market. U.S. taxpayers paid billions to rescue Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the latter managed and controlled by senior officials from the Carter and Clinton Administrations, and to cover the losses of the poorly-managed Federal Housing Administration. Millions lost their homes, millions more lost value in their homes. More than six million households had to move from homeownership to renting. Rental costs escalated so that today nearly 12 million families spend more than 50 percent of their incomes just on rent. The national homeownership rate has sharply fallen and the rate for minority households and young adults has plummeted. So many remain unemployed or underemployed, and for the lucky ones with jobs, rising rents make it harder to save for a mortgage. There is a growing sense that our national standard of living will never be as high as it was in the past. We understand that pessimism but do not share it, for we believe that sound public policies can restore growth to our economy, vigor to the housing market, and hope to those who are now on the margins of prosperity. Our goal is to advance responsible home- ownership while guarding against the abuses that led to the housing collapse. We must scale back the federal role in the housing market, promote responsibility on the part of borrowers and lenders, and avoid future taxpayer bailouts. Reforms should provide clear and prudent underwriting standards and guidelines on predatory lending and acceptable lending practices. Compliance with regulatory standards should constitute a legal safe harbor to guard against opportunistic litigation by trial lawyers. We call for a comprehensive review of federal regulations, especially those dealing with the environment, that make it harder and more costly for Americans to rent, buy, or sell homes. For nine years, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been in conservatorship and the current Administration and Democrats have prevented any effort to reform them. Their corrupt business model lets shareholders and executives reap huge profits while the taxpayers cover all loses. The utility of both agencies should be reconsidered as a Republican administration clears away the jumble of subsidies and controls that complicate and distort home-buying. The Federal Housing Administration, which provides taxpayer-backed guarantees in the mortgage market, should no longer support high- income individuals, and the public should not be financially exposed by risks taken by FHA officials. We will end the government mandates that required Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and federally- insured banks to satisfy lending quotas to specific groups. Discrimination should have no place in the mortgage industry. Zoning decisions have always been, and must remain, under local control. The current Administration is trying to seize control of the zoning process through its Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing regulation. It threatens to undermine zoning laws in order to socially engineer every community in the country. While the federal government has a legitimate role in enforcing non-discrimination laws, this regulation has nothing to do with proven or alleged discrimination and everything to do with hostility to the self-government of citizens. America on the Move Our country's investments in transportation and other public construction have traditionally been non-partisan. Everyone agrees on the need for clean water and safe roads, rail, bridges, ports, and airports. President Eisenhower established a tradition of Republican leadership in this regard by championing the creation of the interstate highway system. In recent years, bipartisan cooperation led to major legislation improving the nation's ports and waterways. Our Republican majority ended the practice of earmarks, which often diverted transportation spending to politically favored projects. In the current Congress, Republicans have secured the longest reauthorization of the Highway Trust Fund in a decade and are advancing a comprehensive reform of the Federal Aviation Administration to make flying easier and more secure. The current Administration has a different approach. It subordinates civil engineering to social engineering as it pursues an exclusively urban vision of dense housing and government transit. Its ill-named Livability Initiative is meant to “coerce people out of their cars.” This is the same mentality that once led Congress to impose by fiat a single maximum speed limit for the entire nation, from Manhattan to Montana. Our 1980 Republican Platform pledged to repeal that edict. After the election of Ronald Reagan, we did. Now we make the same pledge regarding the current problems in transportation policy. We propose to remove from the Highway Trust Fund programs that should not be the business of the federal government. More than a quarter of the Fund's spending is diverted from its original purpose. One fifth of its funds are spent on mass transit, an inherently local affair that serves only a small portion of the population, concentrated in six big cities. Additional funds are used for bike-share programs, sidewalks, recreational trails, landscaping, and historical renovations. Other beneficiaries of highway money are ferry boats, the federal lands access program, scenic byways, and education initiatives. These worthwhile enterprises should be funded through other sources. We propose to phase out the federal transit program and reform provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act which can delay and drive up costs for transportation projects. We renew our call for repeal of the Davis-Bacon law, which limits employment and drives up construction and maintenance costs for the benefit of unions. Recognizing that, over time, additional revenue will be needed to expand the carrying capacity of roads and bridges, we will remove legal roadblocks to public-private partnership agreements that can save the taxpayers' money and bring outside investment to meet a community's needs. With most of the states increasing their own funding for transportation, we oppose a further increase in the federal gas tax. Although unionization has never been permitted in any government agency concerned with national security, the current Administration has reversed that policy for the Transportation Security Administration. We will correct that mistake. Americans understand that, with the threat of terrorism, their travel may encounter delays, but un- acceptably long lines at security checks can have the same impact as a collapsed bridge or washed out highway. TSA employees should always be seen as guardians of the public's safety, not as just another part of the federal workforce. Amtrak is an extremely expensive railroad for the American taxpayers, who must subsidize every ticket. The federal government should allow private ventures to provide passenger service in the northeast corridor. The same holds true with regard to high-speed and intercity rail across the country. We reaffirm our intention to end federal support for boondoggles like California's high-speed train to nowhere. Building the Future: Technology The digital revolution has transformed how we work, learn, sell, shop, socialize — in short, how we live. Technological change drives our positions with regard to STEM education, business and corporate involvement with educational certifications, workforce issues, privacy, cyber and national security, energy development, regulation, and other elements of our campaign for growth and jobs. It is why we propose to simplify the tax code, reduce corporate rates, transition to a territorial system, and create incentives for investment and innovation. We envision government at all levels as a partner with individuals and industries in technological progress, not a meddlesome monitor. We want to create a business climate that rewards risk and promotes innovation, a learning system that gives Americans the skills needed to seize the opportunities of the 21st century, and an international order that maintains a fair and open global market for America's goods and services. We intend to advance policies that protect data privacy while fostering innovation and growth and ensuring the free flow of data across borders. Together, broadband and good ideas have become the 21st century engines of American ingenuity. Innovation, by its nature, is disruptive. In challenging legacy forms of business, innovation creates new jobs, gives access to new markets, opens opportunity to underserved populations, and expands consumer choice. Government must give America's innovators the freedom to create and, on their merits, succeed or fail. Our agenda includes balanced protections for intellectual property, explained elsewhere in this document. We intend to facilitate access to spectrum by paving the way for high-speed, next- generation broadband deployment and competition on the internet and for internet services. We want government to encourage the sharing economy and on-demand platforms to compete in an open market, and we believe public policies should encourage the innovation and competition that are essential for an Internet of Things to thrive. Government must keep pace with the technology deployed in the private sector. There is an urgent need to modernize the federal government's legacy systems and to recruit the skilled technical personnel who can advance the adoption of innovation in the public sector. At the cost of billions, the current Administration has done little to advance our goal of universal broadband coverage. That hurts rural America, where farmers, ranchers, and small business people need connectivity to operate in real time with the world's producers. Almost ten million Americans have given up wired broadband connections in just the last two years alone, and millions more have never been connected in the first place. We encourage public-private partnerships to provide predictable support for connecting rural areas so that every American can fully participate in the global economy. The public-private partnerships between NASA, the Department of Defense, and commercial companies have given us technological progress that has reduced the cost of accessing space and extended America's space leadership in the commercial, civil, and national security spheres. The entrepreneurship and innovation culture of the free market is revitalizing the nation's space capabilities, saving taxpayer money, and advancing technology critical to maintain America's edge in space and in other fields. To protect our national security interests and foster innovation and competitiveness, we must sustain our preeminence in space by launching more scientific missions, guaranteeing unfettered access, and ensuring that our space-related industries remain a source of scientific leadership and education. Building the Future: America’s Electric Grid Our nation's interstate electric transmission system has long been a catalyst for developing and delivering low cost energy while spurring economic growth throughout the United States The grid is aging, vulnerable to cyber and terrorist threats, and unprepared to serve our energy needs of tomorrow. It should not take seven to ten years to plan and construct a transmission line. We support expedited siting processes and the thoughtful expansion of the grid so that consumers and businesses continue to have access to affordable and reliable electricity. Start-up Century: Small Business and Entrepreneurship A central reason why the 20th century came to be called the American Century was the ability of individuals to invent and create in a land of free markets. Back then they were called risk-takers, dreamers, and small business owners. Today they are the entrepreneurs, independent contractors, and small business men and women of our new economy. Their innovation drives improvement and forces long-established institutions to adapt or fade away. Many of them are so young they remember little if anything of the last century because dynamic progress does not look back. As in the past, they still create most new jobs and form the commercial network that holds communities together. Their enterprise is the lifeblood of our economy, but it is weakening. More businesses are closing in our country than are starting. Older firms are an increasing proportion of companies. Productivity growth has slowed. This is not the way to jumpstart a new era of growth. We need to consider the effect of capital gains rates on the availability of venture capital, as well as the positive impact of expensing on start-up firms. We should reduce the occupational licensing laws that shut untold millions of potential workers out of entrepreneurial careers. We must overturn the regulatory nightmare, created by the Dodd- Frank law, for the community banks and savings and loans that provide nearly half of all small- business loans and over three-quarters of all agricultural loans. Indeed, the world of the app economy cries out for the comprehensive regulatory reform proposed elsewhere in this platform. We must challenge established interests and traditional business patterns to facilitate market entry of new business models, i Including inventive means of transport, delivery, and communication. As incubators of unconventional thinking, our country's existing research infrastructure — the National Labs, the National Institutes of Health, NASA, and elements of the Defense Department — have the potential to form partnerships with small businesses to create an American Start-Up Century. The Federal Reserve Because the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions affect job creation, upward mobility for workers, and equitable prosperity, they should be transparent. Similarly, the Federal Reserve's important role as a lender of last resort should also be carried out in a more transparent manner. The Republican Party will advance legislation that brings transparency and accountability to the Federal Reserve, the Federal Open Market Committee, and the Federal Reserve's dealing with foreign banks. The first step is through an annual audit of the Federal Reserve's activities. Such an audit would need to be carefully implemented so that the Federal Reserve remains insulated from political pressures and its decisions are based on sound economic principles and sound money rather than political pressures for easy money and loose credit. Determined to crush the double-digit inflation that was part of the Carter Administration's economic legacy, President Reagan, shortly after his inauguration, established a commission to consider the feasibility of a metallic basis for U.S. currency. In 2012, facing the task of cleaning up the wreckage of the current Administration's policies, we proposed a similar commission to investigate ways to set a fixed value for the dollar. With Republican leadership, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to set up just such a commission. We recommend its enactment by the full Congress and the commission's careful consideration of ways to secure the integrity of our currency. Workplace Freedom for a 21st Century Workforce The greatest asset of the American economy is the hard-working American. That is why our first priority is getting people back to work by fostering the kind of growth that creates jobs. That overarching goal unites all the sections of this platform. It runs through our commitments on education and workforce development. It underlies our approach to welfare reform, regulatory reform, and our determination to advance the kind of trade agreements that multiply opportunities for workers here at home. It also impels us to challenge the anachronistic labor laws that limit workers' freedom and lock them into the workplace rules of their greatgrandfathers. Instead of facilitating change, the current Administration and its agents at the National Labor Relations Board are determined to reverse it. They are attacking the franchise model of business development, which is essential to the flexibility and creativity of the new economy. They are wielding provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act from the 1930s, designed to fit a manufacturing workplace, to deny flexibility to both employers and employees. They have repealed union transparency rules that allowed members to discover what was being done with their dues. They have outlawed alternatives to unions even when they were favored by the workers. Their Project Labor Agreements discriminate against the overwhelming majority of workers by barring them from jobs on taxpayer-funded projects. Their patronizing and controlling approach leaves workers in a form of peonage to the NLRB. We intend to restore fairness and common sense to that agency. Technology has already created jobs that did not exist fifteen years ago, and today's workers need flexibility and family-friendly options to make the most of them, especially portability in pension plans and health insurance. We intend to encourage those trends by bringing labor law into the 21st century. It should encourage cooperation between management and workers, not conflict. All workers, including union members, must be free to accept raises and rewards without veto power from union officials. All unionized workers should be able to find out what is going on in their union trust funds and in their executive compensation. We support the right of states to enact Right-to-Work laws and call for a national law to protect the economic liberty of the modern workforce. All Americans deserve the opportunity to pursue their American dream free from discrimination. Clear nondiscrimination policies ensure all employees have the chance to succeed based solely on their merits. These policies are vital to creating an inclusive, innovative, and competitive workforce. Republicans believe that the employer- employee relationship of the future will be built upon employee empowerment and workplace flexibility. We therefore endorse employee stock ownership plans that enable workers to become capitalists, expand the realm of private property, and energize a free enterprise economy. Minimum wage is an issue that should be handled at the state and local level. A Federal Workforce Serving the People The federal workforce is larger and more highly paid than ever. The taxpayers spend an average of $35,000 a year per employee on non-cash benefits, triple the average non-cash compensation of the average worker in the private sector. Federal employees receive extraordinary pension benefits and vacation time wildly out of line with those of the private sector. We urge Congress to bring federal compensation and benefits in line with the standards of most American employees. A Republican administration should streamline personnel procedures to expedite the firing of bad workers, tax cheats, and scammers. The unionization of the federal workforce, first permitted by Democrat presidents in the 1960s, should be reviewed by the appropriate congressional committees to examine its effects on the cost, quality, and performance of the civil service. Union representatives in the federal workforce should not be paid to conduct union business on the public's time. Reducing the Federal Debt Our national debt is a burden on our economy and families. The huge increase in the national debt demanded by and incurred during the current Administration has placed a significant burden on future generations. We must impose firm caps on future debt, accelerate the repayment of the trillions we now owe in order to reaffirm our principles of responsible and limited government, and remove the burdens we are placing on future generations. A strong economy is one key to debt reduction, but spending restraint is a necessary component that must be vigorously pursued. A Rebirth of Constitutional Government We the People We are the party of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. The Declaration sets forth the fundamental precepts of American government: That God bestows certain inalienable rights on every individual, thus producing human equality; that government exists first and foremost to protect those inalienable rights; that man-made law must be consistent with God-given, natural rights; and that if God-given, natural, inalienable rights come in conflict with government, court, or human-granted rights, God-given, natural, inalienable rights always prevail; that there is a moral law recognized as “the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God”; and that American government is to operate with the consent of the governed. We are also the party of the Constitution, the greatest political document ever written. It is the solemn compact built upon principles of the Declaration that enshrines our God-given individual rights and ensures that all Americans stand equal before the law, defines the purposes and limits of government, and is the blueprint for ordered liberty that makes the United States the world's freest and most prosperous nation. We reaffirm the Constitution's fundamental principles: limited government, separation of powers, individual liberty, and the rule of law. We denounce bigotry, racism, anti-Semitism, ethnic prejudice, and religious intolerance. Therefore, we oppose discrimination based on race, sex, religion, creed, disability, or national origin and support statutes to end such discrimination. As the Party of Abraham Lincoln, we must continue to foster solutions to America's difficult challenges when it comes to race relations today. We continue to encourage equality for all citizens and access to the American Dream. Merit and hard work should determine advancement in our society, so we reject unfair preferences, quotas, and set-asides as forms of discrimination. Our ranks include Americans from every faith and tradition, and we respect the right of each American to follow his or her deeply held beliefs. Our Constitution is in crisis. More than 90 percent of federal requirements are now imposed by regulatory agencies, without any vote of the House or Senate or signature of the President. The current Administration has exceeded its constitutional authority, brazenly and flagrantly violated the separation of powers, sought to divide America into groups and turn citizen against citizen. The President has refused to defend or enforce laws he does not like, used executive orders to enact national policies in areas constitutionally reserved solely to Congress, made unconstitutional “recess” appointments to Senate-confirmed positions, directed regulatory agencies to overstep their statutory authority, and failed to consult Congress regarding military action overseas. He has changed what John Adams called “a government of laws and not of men” into just the opposite. Democrats in Congress have enabled, supported, and defended each of these breaches. They have applauded the President's efforts to do an end-run around Congress and stymied Republican efforts to restrain executive lawlessness. Democrats in Congress have also endorsed an anticonstitutional agenda of their own. Forty-eight Democratic senators, for instance, voted to amend the Bill of Rights to give government officials control over political speech. Democrats in Congress have likewise proposed bills that would limit religious liberty, undermine property rights, and eviscerate the Second Amendment. In a free society, the primary role of government is to protect the God-given, inalienable rights of its citizens. These constitutional rights are not negotiable for any American. We affirm that all legislation, regulation, and official actions must conform to the Constitution's original meaning as understood at the time the language was adopted. Our most urgent task as a Party is to restore the American people's faith in their government by electing a president who will enforce duly enacted laws, honor constitutional limits on executive authority, and return credibility to the Oval Office. We need a Republican president who will end abuses of power by departments and agencies, like the IRS and the EPA, and by the White House itself. Safeguarding our liberties requires a president who will respect the Constitution's separation of powers, including the authority of Congress to write legislation and define agency authority. Americans also deserve a president who will speak for our nation's history and values, not apologize for them to our enemies. The Judiciary The rule of law is the foundation of our Republic. A critical threat to our country's constitutional order is an activist judiciary that usurps powers properly reserved to the people through other branches of government. Only a Republican president will appoint judges who respect the rule of law expressed within the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, including the inalienable right to life and the laws of nature and nature's God, as did the late Justice Antonin Scalia. We are facing a national crisis in our judiciary. We understand that only by electing a Republican president in 2016 will America have the opportunity for up to five new constitutionally-minded Supreme Court justices appointed to fill vacancies on the Court. Only such appointments will enable courts to begin to reverse the long line of activist decisions — including Roe, Obergefell, and the Obamacare cases — that have usurped Congress's and states' lawmaking authority, undermined constitutional protections, expanded the power of the judiciary at the expense of the people and their elected representatives, and stripped the people of their power to govern themselves. We believe in the constitutional checks and balances and that the Founders intended the judiciary to be the weakest branch. We encourage Congress to use the check of impeachment for judges who unconstitutionally usurp Article I powers. In tandem with a Republican Senate, a new Republican president will restore to the Court a strong conservative majority that will follow the text and original meaning of the Constitution and our laws. The legitimate powers of government are rooted in the consent of the American people. Judicial activism that includes reliance on foreign law or unratified treaties undermines American sovereignty. Foreign laws and precedents should not be used to interpret our Constitution or laws, nor should foreign sources of law be used in state courts’ adjudication of criminal or civil matters. We also affirm the wisdom of President George Washington’s warning to avoid foreign entanglements and unnecessary alliances. We therefore oppose the adoption or ratification of treaties that would weaken or encroach upon American sovereignty or that could be construed by courts to do so. We will not recognize as binding upon the United States any international agreement forged without the constitutionally required assent of two-thirds of the United States Senate. Administrative Law Article I of the Constitution directs that ""All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States....” For more than a century, however, Congress has delegated increasing amounts of legislative authority to executive departments, agencies, and commissions, laying the foundation for today’s vast administrative state. Unelected bureaucrats in the executive branch now write countless rules with the force of law and arbitrarily punish individuals who disobey those rules. The Constitution makes clear that these powers were granted to Congress by the people and must therefore remain solely with the people’s elected representatives. We call on Congress to begin reclaiming its constitutional powers from the bureaucratic state by requiring that major new federal regulations be approved by Congress before they can take effect, such as through the Regulation Freedom Amendment. We further affirm that courts should interpret laws as written by Congress rather than allowing executive agencies to rewrite those laws to suit administration priorities. Defending Marriage Against an Activist Judiciary Traditional marriage and family, based on marriage between one man and one woman, is the foundation for a free society and has for millennia been entrusted with rearing children and instilling cultural values. We condemn the Supreme Court's ruling in United States v. Windsor, which wrongly removed the ability of Congress to define marriage policy in federal law. We also condemn the Supreme Court's lawless ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which in the words of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, was a “judicial Putsch” — full of “silly extravagances” — that reduced “the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Storey to the mystical aphorisms of a fortune cookie.” In Obergefell, five unelected lawyers robbed 320 million Americans of their legitimate constitutional authority to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman. The Court twisted the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment beyond recognition. To echo Scalia, we dissent. We, therefore, support the appointment of justices and judges who respect the constitutional limits on their power and respect the authority of the states to decide such fundamental social questions. The First Amendment: Religious Liberty The Bill of Rights lists religious liberty, with its rights of conscience, as the first freedom to be protected. Religious freedom in the Bill of Rights protects the right of the people to practice their faith in their everyday lives. As George Washington taught, “religion and morality are indispensable supports” to a free society. Similarly, Thomas Jefferson declared that “No provision in our Constitution ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of the civil authority.” Ongoing attempts to compel individuals, businesses, and institutions of faith to transgress their beliefs are part of a misguided effort to undermine religion and drive it from the public square. As a result, many charitable religious institutions that have demonstrated great success in helping the needy have been barred from receiving government grants and contracts. Government officials threaten religious colleges and universities with massive fines and seek to control their personnel decisions. Places of worship for the first time in our history have reason to fear the loss of tax-exempt status merely for espousing and practicing traditional religious beliefs that have been held across the world for thousands of years, and for almost four centuries in America. We value the right of America’s religious leaders to preach, and Americans to speak freely, according to their faith. Republicans believe the federal government, specifically the IRS, is constitutionally prohibited from policing or censoring speech based on religious convictions or beliefs, and therefore we urge the repeal of the Johnson Amendment. We pledge to defend the religious beliefs and rights of conscience of all Americans and to safeguard religious institutions against government control. We endorse the First Amendment Defense Act, Republican legislation in the House and Senate which will bar government discrimination against individuals and businesses for acting on the belief that marriage is the union of one man and one woman. This Act would protect the non-profit tax status of faith-based adoption agencies, the accreditation of religious educational institutions, the grants and contracts of faith-based charities and small businesses, and the licensing of religious professions — all of which are under assault by elements of the Democratic Party. We encourage every state to pass similar legislation. We likewise endorse the efforts of Republican state legislators and governors who have defied intimidation from corporations and the media in defending religious liberty. We support laws to confirm the longstanding American tradition that religious individuals and institutions can educate young people, receive government benefits, and participate in public debates without having to check their religious beliefs at the door. Our First Amendment rights are not given to us by the government but are rights we inherently possess. The government cannot use subsequent amendments to limit First Amendment rights. The Free Exercise Clause is both an individual and a collective liberty protecting a right to worship God according to the dictates of conscience. Therefore, we strongly support the freedom of Americans to act in accordance with their religious beliefs, not only in their houses of worship, but also in their everyday lives. We support the right of the people to conduct their businesses in accordance with their religious beliefs and condemn public officials who have proposed boycotts against businesses that support traditional marriage. We pledge to protect those business owners who have been subjected to hate campaigns, threats of violence, and other attempts to deny their civil rights. We support the public display of the Ten Commandments as a reflection of our history and our country's Judeo-Christian heritage and further affirm the rights of religious students to engage in voluntary prayer at public school events and to have equal access to school facilities. We assert the First Amendment right of freedom of association for religious, private, service, and youth organizations to set their own membership standards. The First Amendment: Constitutionally Protected Speech The rights of citizenship do not stop at the ballot box. Freedom of speech includes the right to devote resources to whatever cause or candidate one supports. We oppose any restrictions or conditions that would discourage citizens from participating in the public square or limit their ability to promote their ideas, such as requiring private organizations to publicly disclose their donors to the government. Limits on political speech serve only to protect the powerful and insulate incumbent officeholders. We support repeal of federal restrictions on political parties in McCain-Feingold, raising or repealing contribution limits, protecting the political speech of advocacy groups, corporations, and labor unions, and protecting political speech on the internet. We likewise call for an end to the so-called Fairness Doctrine, and support free-market approaches to free speech unregulated by government. We believe the forced funding of political candidates through union dues and other mandatory contributions violates the First Amendment. Just as Americans have a First Amendment right to devote resources to favored candidates or views, they have a First Amendment right not to be forced to individually support individuals or ideologies that they oppose. We agree with Thomas Jefferson that “To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical.” The Second Amendment: Our Right to Keep and Bear Arms We uphold the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, a natural inalienable right that predates the Constitution and is secured by the Second Amendment. Lawful gun ownership enables Americans to exercise their God-given right of selfdefense for the safety of their homes, their loved ones, and their communities. We salute the Republican Congress for defending the right to keep and bear arms by preventing the President from installing a new liberal majority on the Supreme Court. The confirmation to the Court of additional anti-gun justices would eviscerate the Second Amendment's fundamental protections. Already, local officials in the nation's capital and elsewhere are defying the Court's decisions upholding an individual right to bear arms as affirmed by the Supreme Court in Heller and McDonald. We support firearm reciprocity legislation to recognize the right of law-abiding Americans to carry firearms to protect themselves and their families in all 50 states. We support constitutional carry statutes and salute the states that have passed them. We oppose ill-conceived laws that would restrict magazine capacity or ban the sale of the most popular and common modern rifle. We also oppose any effort to deprive individuals of their right to keep and bear arms without due process of law. We condemn frivolous lawsuits against gun manufacturers and the current Administration's illegal harassment of firearm dealers. We oppose federal licensing or registration of law-abiding gun owners, registration of ammunition, and restoration of the ill-fated Clinton gun ban. We call for a thorough investigation — by a new Republican administration — of the deadly “Fast and Furious” operation perpetrated by Department of Justice officials who approved and allowed illegal sales of guns to known violent criminals. The Fourth Amendment: Liberty and Privacy Affirming the Fourth Amendment “right of the people to be secure in their houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,” we call for strict limitations on the use of aerial surveillance on U.S. soil, with the exception of patrolling our national borders for illegal entry and activity. We oppose any attempts by government to require surveillance devices in our daily lives, including tracking devices in motor vehicles. In recent years, technology companies have responded to market demand for products and services that protect the privacy of customers through increasingly sophisticated encryption technology. These increased privacy protections have become crucial to the digital economy. At the same time, however, such innovations have brought new dangers, especially from criminals and terrorists who seek to use encryption technology to harm us. No matter the medium, citizens must retain the right to communicate with one another free from unlawful government intrusion. It will not be easy to balance privacy rights with the government's legitimate need to access encrypted information. This issue is too important to be left to the courts. A Republican president and a Republican Congress must listen to the American people and forge a consensus solution. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and the Foreign Bank and Asset Reporting Requirements result in government's warrantless seizure of personal financial information without reasonable suspicion or probable cause. Americans overseas should enjoy the same rights as Americans residing in the United States, whose private financial information is not subject to disclosure to the government except as to interest earned. The requirement for all banks around the world to provide detailed information to the IRS about American account holders outside the United States has resulted in banks refusing service to them. Thus, FATCA not only allows “unreasonable search and seizures” but also threatens the ability of overseas Americans to lead normal lives. We call for its repeal and for a change to residency-based taxation for U.S. citizens overseas. The Fifth Amendment: Protecting Human Life The Constitution's guarantee that no one can “be deprived of life, liberty or property” deliberately echoes the Declaration of Independence's proclamation that “all” are “endowed by their Creator” with the inalienable right to life. Accordingly, we assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to children before birth. We oppose the use of public funds to perform or promote abortion or to fund organizations, like Planned Parenthood, so long as they provide or refer for elective abortions or sell fetal body parts rather than provide healthcare. We urge all states and Congress to make it a crime to acquire, transfer, or sell fetal tissues from elective abortions for research, and we call on Congress to enact a ban on any sale of fetal body parts. In the meantime, we call on Congress to ban the practice of misleading women on so-called fetal harvesting consent forms, a fact revealed by a 2015 investigation. We will not fund or subsidize healthcare that includes abortion coverage. We support the appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life. We oppose the non-consensual withholding or withdrawal of care or treatment, including food and water, from individuals with disabilities, newborns, the elderly, or the infirm, just as we oppose euthanasia and assisted suicide. We affirm our moral obligation to assist, rather than penalize, women who face an unplanned pregnancy. In order to encourage women who face an unplanned pregnancy to choose life, we support legislation that requires financial responsibility for the child be equally borne by both the mother and father upon conception until the child reaches adulthood. Failure to require a father to be equally responsible for a child places an inequitable burden on the mother, creating a financial and social hardship on both mother and child. We celebrate the millions of Americans who open their hearts, homes, and churches to mothers in need and women fleeing abuse. We thank and encourage providers of counseling, medical services, and adoption assistance for empowering women experiencing an unintended pregnancy to choose life. We support funding for ultrasounds and adoption assistance. We salute the many states that now protect women and girls through laws requiring informed consent, parental consent, waiting periods, and clinic regulation. We condemn the Supreme Court's activist decision in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt striking down commonsense Texas laws providing for basic health and safety standards in abortion clinics. We applaud the U.S. House of Representatives for leading the effort to add enforcement to the Born-Alive Infant Protection Act by passing the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which imposes appropriate civil and criminal penalties on healthcare providers who fail to provide treatment and care to an infant who survives an abortion, including early induction delivery whether the death of the infant is intended. We strongly oppose infanticide. Over a dozen states have passed Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Acts prohibiting abortion after twenty weeks, the point at which current medical research shows that unborn babies can feel excruciating pain during abortions, and we call on Congress to enact the federal version. Not only is it good legislation, but it enjoys the support of a majority of the American people. We support state and federal efforts against the cruelest forms of abortion, especially dismemberment abortion procedures, in which unborn babies are literally torn apart limb from limb. We call on Congress to ban sex-selection abortions and abortions based on disabilities — discrimination in its most lethal form. We oppose embryonic stem cell research. We oppose federal funding of embryonic stem cell research. We support adult stem cell research and urge the restoration of the national placental stem cell bank created by President George H.W. Bush but abolished by his Democrat successor, President Bill Clinton. We oppose federal funding for harvesting embryos and call for a ban on human cloning. The Democratic Party is extreme on abortion. Democrats' almost limitless support for abortion, and their strident opposition to even the most basic restrictions on abortion, put them dramatically out of step with the American people. Because of their opposition to simple abortion clinic safety procedures, support for taxpayer-funded abortion, and rejection of pregnancy resource centers that provide abortion alternatives, the old Clinton mantra of “safe, legal, and rare” has been reduced to just “legal.” We are proud to be the party that protects human life and offers real solutions for women. The Fifth Amendment: Protecting Private Property The Framers of our government knew, from history and experience, that when private property is not secure, freedom is at risk. That is why the Fifth Amendment declares that private property may not be “taken for public use without just compensation.” The Supreme Court's Kelo decision undermined this safeguard by allowing local governments to seize a person's home or land not only for vital public use, but also for “public purpose,” which thus allowed the government to seize it for transfer to private developers or other private entities. We call on any state legislatures that have not already done so to nullify the impact of Kelo within their jurisdiction by legislation or state constitutional amendments declaring that private property may be taken only for true public use, and we join House Republicans in supporting the Private Property Rights Protection Act. The government at every level must always pay just compensation whenever it takes private property to achieve a compelling public use, with the money coming from the budget of the agency performing the taking. This includes the taking of water rights and the taking of property by environmental regulations that destroy or diminish the property's value. Civil asset forfeiture was originally intended as a way to cripple organized crime through the seizure of property used in a criminal enterprise. Regrettably, it has become a tool for unscrupulous law enforcement officials, acting without due process, to profit by destroying the livelihood of innocent individuals, many of whom never recover the lawful assets taken from them. When the rights of the innocent can be so easily violated, no one's rights are safe. We call on Congress and state legislatures to enact reforms to protect law-abiding citizens against abusive asset forfeiture tactics. The Fifth Amendment: Intellectual Property Rights Private property includes not only physical property such as lands and homes, but also intellectual property like books and patents. Article 1, section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to safeguard intellectual property rights for “Authors and Inventors.” By protecting the proprietary rights of creators and innovators, the Constitution promotes the general welfare by providing incentives for investment in all sorts of technology and artistic works. Intellectual property is a driving force in today's global economy of constant innovation. It is the wellspring of American economic growth and job creation. With the rise of the digital economy, it has become even more critical that we protect intellectual property rights and preserve freedom of contract rather than create regulatory barriers to creativity, growth, and innovation. Protecting intellectual property is also a national security issue. We must guard against counterfeit parts that can compromise the reliability of our weapons systems and the safety of military personnel. Today, the worst offenses against intellectual property rights come from abroad, especially in China. We call for strong action by Congress and a new Republican president to enforce intellectual property laws against all infringers, whether foreign or domestic. The Ninth Amendment: The People’s Retained Rights The Ninth Amendment to the Constitution declares that “[t]he enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” This provision codifies the principle that our national government derives its power from the governed and that all powers not delegated to the government are retained by the people. We call upon legislators to give full force to this fundamental principle. We welcome to our ranks all citizens who are determined to reclaim the rights of the people that have been ignored or usurped by the federal and intrusive state governments. The Tenth Amendment: Federalism as the Foundation of Personal Liberty Federalism is a cornerstone of our constitutional system. Every violation of state sovereignty by federal officials is not merely a transgression of one unit of government against another; it is an assault on the liberties of individual Americans. Hence the promise of the Tenth Amendment: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” The Constitution gives the federal government very few powers, and they are specifically enumerated; the states and the people retain authority over all unenumerated powers. In obedience to that principle, we condemn the current Administration’s unconstitutional expansion into areas beyond those specifically enumerated, including bullying of state and local governments in matters ranging from voter identification (ID) laws, to immigration, from healthcare programs to land use decisions, and from forced education curricula to school restroom policies. We pledge to restore the proper balance and vertical separation of powers between the federal government and state governments - the governments closest to, and most reflective of, the American people. We encourage states to reinvigorate their traditional role as the laboratories of democracy, propelling the nation forward through local and state innovation. Big government undermines federalism through more than 1,100 grants-in-aid programs that consume more than one-sixth of the federal budget for matters that should be the exclusive responsibility of the states. Through these programs, money originating from state taxpayers is returned to the states, usually greatly reduced, with myriad strings attached. These grants turn state and local elected officials into agents of the federal government. The web of conditions and regulations — especially the requirement of matching funds that comes with federal grants - transforms recipients into appendages of the Washington bureaucracy. We call upon Congress to help a Republican president to reduce and ultimately eliminate this system of conditioned grants so that state and local taxpayers can decide for themselves what is best for their own communities. Honest Elections and the Electoral College We oppose the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact and any other scheme to abolish or distort the procedures of the Electoral College. An unconstitutional effort to impose National Popular Vote would be a grave threat to our federal system and a guarantee of corruption, as every ballot box in every state would offer a chance to steal the presidency. We urge state legislatures that have voted for this proposal to rescind their approval. Honest Elections and the Right to Vote Honest elections are the foundation of representative government. We pledge to protect the voting rights of every citizen, as well as their rights of conscience when they are harassed or denied a job because of their contributions to a candidate or a cause. We support state efforts to ensure ballot access for the elderly, the handicapped, military personnel, and all legitimate voters. We urge state and local officials to take all appropriate steps to allow voters to cast their ballots in a timely manner. We are concerned, however, that some voting procedures may be open to abuse. For this reason, we support legislation to require proof of citizenship when registering to vote and secure photo ID when voting. We strongly oppose litigation against states exercising their sovereign authority to enact such laws. In addition, to guarantee that everyone’s vote is counted, we urge that electronic voting systems have a voter-verified paper audit trail. We urge every state to join the Interstate Voter Registration Cross Check Program to keep voter rolls accurate and to prevent people from voting in more than one state in the same election. To guard against foreign involvement in our elections, we call for vigilance regarding online credit card contributions to candidates and campaigns. The members of our Armed Forces must not be denied the basic rights that they are defending for others. Our troops, wherever stationed, must be allowed to vote in a timely manner. We call upon the entire military chain of command to ensure the voting rights of our citizen soldiers. The Constitution gives Congress authority to conduct the decennial census ""in such Manner as they shall by Law direct.” In order to preserve the principle of one person, one vote, we urge our elected representatives to ensure that citizenship, rather than mere residency, be made the basis for the apportionment of representatives among the states. America’s Natural Resources: Agriculture, Energy, and the Environment We are the party of America's growers, producers, farmers, ranchers, foresters, miners, commercial fishermen, and all those who bring from the earth the crops, minerals, energy, and the bounties of our seas that are the lifeblood of our economy. Their labor and ingenuity, their determination in bad times and love of the land at all times, powers our economy, creates millions of jobs, and feeds billions of people around the world. Only a few years ago, a bipartisan consensus in government valued the role of extractive industries and rewarded their enterprise by minimizing its interference with their work. That has radically changed. We look in vain within the Democratic Party for leaders who will speak for the people of agriculture, energy, and mineral production Abundant Harvests Agricultural production and exports are central to the Republican agenda for jobs, growth, expanded trade, and prosperity. Because our farmers and ranchers care for the land, the United States does not depend on foreign imports for sustenance. Americans spend a smaller percentage of their income on food than any other nation. On average, one American farm produces enough food to feed 155 people. No other nation has been as generous with food aid to the needy. We have good reason to celebrate our domestic security in food. We are the largest agricultural exporter in the world, and our exports are vital for other sectors of our economy. Those exports drive additional economic growth as each dollar of agricultural exports generates another $1.27 in business activity. That is why we remain committed to expanding trade opportunities and opening new markets for agriculture. Under a Republican president, America's trade negotiators will insist that our global trading partners adhere to science-based standards with regard to food and health regulations. We will not tolerate the use of bogus science and scare tactics to bar our products from foreign markets, nor will we allow insufficient health and safety standards for products imported for our consumption. We must also ensure that domestic policies do not compromise our global competitiveness through overregulation and undue interference in the marketplace. There is growing recognition that federal dairy policies, crafted during the Great Depression, are increasingly an impediment to the ability of our dairy producers to meet the expected doubling in global demand coming by 2030. We oppose the policies pushed by special interest groups seeking to stop or make more expensive our current system of safe, efficient, and humane production of meat. Congress has repeatedly had to block the current Administration's draconian rules concerning the marketing of poultry and livestock. This regulatory impulse must be curbed, not on a case-by-case basis, but through a fundamental restructuring of the regulatory process. In the meantime, the intrusive and expensive federal mandates on food options and menu labeling should be ended as soon as possible by a Republican Congress. We oppose the mandatory labeling of genetically modified food, which has proven to be safe, healthy, and a literal life-saver for millions in the developing world. The Democratic Administration's sustained support for additional regulation of agriculture has directly resulted in higher costs of production for those who produce the food we eat. This federal regulatory overreach has resulted and will continue to result in higher food prices for Americans. These higher food costs are particularly challenging for those Americans struggling to make ends meet. Like the rest of the economy, agriculture has suffered through eight years of the Democrats' regulatory juggernaut, particularly from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). States, not Washington bureaucrats, are best equipped to engage farmers and ranchers to develop sound farm oversight policies. The EPA's Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule, issued jointly with the Army Corps of Engineers, is a travesty. It extends the government's jurisdiction over navigable waters into the micro-management of puddles and ditches on farms, ranches, and other privately-held property. Ditches, dry creek beds, stock ponds, prairie potholes, and other non- navigable wet areas are already regulated by the states. WOTUS is now subject to judicial review and must be invalidated, but that will not be sufficient. Unelected bureaucrats must be stopped from furthering the Democratic Party's political agenda through regulatory demands forced upon citizens and businesses beyond that which is required by law. We must never allow federal agencies to seize control of state waters, watersheds, or groundwater. State waters, watersheds, and groundwater must be the purview of the sovereign states. Farmers and ranchers are among this country's leading conservationists. Modern farm practices and technologies, supported by programs from the Department of Agriculture, have led to reduced erosion, improved water and air quality, increased wildlife habitat, all the while maintaining improved agricultural yields. This stewardship of the land benefits everyone, and we remain committed to conservation policies based on the preservation, not the restriction, of working lands. For this reason, ranching on public lands must be fostered, developed, and encouraged. This includes providing for an abundant water supply for America's farmers, ranchers, and their communities. Farming and ranching remain high-risk endeavors, and they cannot be isolated from market forces. No segment of agriculture can expect treatment so favorable that it seriously disadvantages workers in other trades. Federal programs to assist farmers in managing risk must be as cost-effective as they are functional, offering tools that can improve producers' ability to operate when times are tough while remaining affordable to the taxpayers. Even so, the expansion of agricultural exports through the vigorous opening of new markets around the world is the surest path to farm security. While uncertainty about natural weather and markets is a risk farmers and ranchers always face, government should not add to their uncertainty by inaction and delay. Thanks in large part to a lack of leadership from the current Administration and congressional Democrats, the last Farm Bill took far too long to enact, creating instability about farm policy for nearly two years. Republicans are dedicated to leading this country forward, which includes getting things done on time, including the next Farm Bill. The Democrats play politics with farm security. Much of the Democrats’ delay had nothing to do with the vital role of American agriculture. It concerned their efforts to expand welfare through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which now comprises more than 70 percent of all farm bill spending. During the last eight years of a Democratic Administration, nearly all the work requirements for able-bodied adults, instituted by our landmark welfare reform of 1996, have been removed. We will restore those provisions and, to correct a mistake made when the Food Stamp program was first created in 1964, separate the administration of SNAP from the Department of Agriculture. Like all other sectors of our society, agriculture is directly impacted by the constant advance in technology. Agriculture now faces a revolution in the generation of ""Big Data” — information produced not only through public oversight of regulations and programs, but also from private business records of farming and ranching operations. In the interest of protecting the safety of our farmers and ranchers, we will advance policies to protect the security, privacy, and most of all, the private ownership of individual farmers’ and ranchers’ data. The U. S. Forest Service, within the Department of Agriculture, controls around 200 million acres of land with enormous natural resources, especially timber, a renewable resource providing jobs for thousands of workers that should be used to the best economic potential for the nation. Many of our national forests are in worsening health with the threat of invasive species, insect mortality, and the severe risk of wildfire. The increase in catastrophic wildfires has been needlessly killing millions of animals and destroying homes and watersheds for decades in the western states. The expense to suppress wildfires related to failed federal forest policies continues to increase. When timber is managed properly, the renewable crops will result in fewer wildfires and, at the same time, produce jobs in the timber industry for countless families. We believe in promoting active, sustainable management of our forests and that states can best manage our forests to improve forest health and keep communities safe. A New Era in Energy Our country has greater energy resources than any other place on earth. Our engineers and miners, the men and women whose labor taps the forces of nature, are the best in the world. Together, the people of America’s energy sector provide us with power that is clean, affordable, secure, and abundant. Their work can guarantee the nation’s energy security for centuries to come if, instead of erecting roadblocks, government facilitates the creation of an all-of-the-above energy strategy. We applaud congressional Republicans for doing just that through far-sighted legislation. Both Houses have passed bills that will modernize pipelines and the electric grid, protect the grid from disruption, expedite energy exports, and lower energy costs. A Republican administration will build on those policies to find new ways to store electricity, a breakthrough of extraordinary import. Planning for our energy future requires us to first determine what resources we have in reserve. Thirty years ago, the world’s estimated reserves of oil were 645 billion barrels. Today, that figure is 1.65 trillion barrels. The more we know what we will have in the future, the better we can decide how to use it. That is why we support the opening of public lands and the outer continental shelf to exploration and responsible production, even if these resources will not be immediately developed. Because we believe states can best promote economic growth while protecting the environment, Congress should give authority to state regulators to manage energy resources on federally controlled public lands within their respective borders. The Democratic Party’s energy policy can be summed up in a slogan currently popular among its activists: ""keep it in the ground.” Keeping energy in the earth will keep jobs out of reach of those who need them most. For low-income Americans, expensive energy means colder homes in the winter and hotter homes in the summer, less mobility in employment, and higher food prices. The current Administration, and particularly its EPA, seems not to care. Its Clean Power Plan — the centerpiece of the President’s war on coal — has been stayed by the Supreme Court. We will do away with it altogether. The Democratic Party does not understand that coal is an abundant, clean, affordable, reliable domestic energy resource. Those who mine it and their families should be protected from the Democratic Party’s radical anticoal agenda. The Democratic Party’s campaign to smother the U.S. energy industry takes many forms, but the permitting process may be its most damaging weapon. It takes an average of 30 days for states to permit an oil or gas well. It takes the federal government longer than seven months. Three decades ago, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) leased 12.2 million acres. In 2014, it leased only one-tenth of that number. Our nuclear industry, cleanly generating almost 20 percent of our electricity from its 99 plants, has a remarkable safety record, but only a handful of plants have been permitted in over three decades. Permitting for a safe, non-polluting hydroelectric facility, even one that is being relicensed, can take many years because of the current President’s hostility to dams. The Keystone Pipeline has become a symbol of everything wrong with the current Administration’s ideological approach. After years of delay, the President killed it to satisfy environmental extremists. We intend to finish that pipeline and others as part of our commitment to North American energy security. Government should not play favorites among energy producers. The taxpayers will not soon forget the current Administration’s subsidies to companies that went bankrupt without producing a kilowatt of energy. The same Administration now requires the Department of Defense, operating with slashed budgets during a time of expanding conflict, to use its scarce resources to generate 25 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2025. Climate change is far from this nation’s most pressing national security issue. This is the triumph of extremism over common sense, and Congress must stop it. We support the development of all forms of energy that are marketable in a free economy without subsidies, including coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear power, and hydropower. A federal judge has struck down the BLM’s rule on hydraulic fracturing and we support upholding this decision. We respect the states’ proven ability to regulate the use of hydraulic fracturing, methane emissions, and horizontal drilling, and we will end the Administration’s disregard of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act with respect to the long-term storage of nuclear waste. We encourage the cost-effective development of renewable energy sources — wind, solar, biomass, biofuel, geothermal, and tidal energy — by private capital. The United States is overwhelmingly dependent on China and other nations for rare earth and other hardrock minerals. These minerals are critical to advanced technology, renewable energy, and defense manufacturing. We support expediting the permitting process for mineral production on public lands. We support lifting restrictions to allow responsible development of nuclear energy, including research into alternative processes like thorium nuclear energy. We oppose any carbon tax. It would increase energy prices across the board, hitting hardest at the families who are already struggling to pay their bills in the Democrats’ no-growth economy. We urge the private sector to focus its resources on the development of carbon capture and sequestration technology still in its early stages here and overseas. American energy producers should be free to export their product to foreign markets. This is particularly important because of international demand for liquefied natural gas, and we must expedite the energy export terminals currently blocked by the Administration. Energy exports will create high paying jobs throughout the United States, reduce our nation’s trade deficit, grow our economy, and boost the energy security of our allies and trading partners. We remain committed to aggressively expanding trade opportunities and opening new markets for American energy through multilateral and bilateral agreements, whether current, pending, or negotiated in the future. Energy is both an economic and national security issue. We support the enactment of policies to increase domestic energy production, including production on public lands, to counter market manipulation by OPEC and other nationally- owned oil companies. This will reduce America’s vulnerability to energy price volatility. Environmental Progress Conservation is inherent in conservatism. As the pioneer of environmentalism a century ago, the Republican Party reaffirms the moral obligation to be good stewards of the God-given natural beauty and resources of our country. We believe that people are the most valuable resources and that human health and safety are the proper measurements of a policy’s success. We assert that private ownership has been the best guarantee of conscientious stewardship, while some of the worst instances of degradation have occurred under government control. Poverty, not wealth, is the gravest threat to the environment, while steady economic growth brings the technological advances which make environmental progress possible. The environment is too important to be left to radical environmentalists. They are using yesterday's tools to control a future they do not comprehend. The environmental establishment has become a self-serving elite, stuck in the mindset of the 1970s, subordinating the public's consensus to the goals of the Democratic Party. Their approach is based on shoddy science, scare tactics, and centralized command-and-control regulation. Over the last eight years, the Administration has triggered an avalanche of regulation that wreaks havoc across our economy and yields minimal environmental benefits. The central fact of any sensible environmental policy is that, year by year, the environment is improving. Our air and waterways are much healthier than they were a few decades ago. As a nation, we have drastically reduced pollution, mainstreamed recycling, educated the public, and avoided ecological degradation. Even if no additional controls are added, air pollution will continue to decline for the next several decades due to technological turnover of aging equipment. These successes become a challenge for Democratic Party environmental extremists, who must reach farther and demand more to sustain the illusion of an environmental crisis. That is why they routinely ignore costs, exaggerate benefits, and advocate the breaching of constitutional boundaries by federal agencies to impose environmental regulation. At the same time, the environmental establishment looks the other way when environmental degradation is caused by the EPA and other federal agencies as was the case during the Animas River spill. Our agenda is high on job creation, expanding opportunity and providing a better chance at life for everyone willing to work for it. Our modern approach to environmentalism is directed to that end, and it starts with dramatic change in official Washington. We propose to shift responsibility for environmental regulation from the federal bureaucracy to the states and to transform the EPA into an independent bipartisan commission, similar to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, with structural safeguards against politicized science. We will strictly limit congressional delegation of rule-making authority, and require that citizens be compensated for regulatory takings. We will put an end to the legal practice known as “sue and settle,” in which environmental groups sue federal agencies whose officials are complicit in the litigation so that, with the taxpayers excluded, both parties can reach agreement behind closed doors. That deceit betrays the public's trust; it will no longer be tolerated. We will also reform the Equal Access to Justice Act to cap and disclose payments made to environmental activists and return the Act to its original intent. We will enforce the original intent of the Clean Water Act, not it's distortion by EPA regulations. We will likewise forbid the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide, something never envisioned when Congress passed the Clean Air Act. We will restore to Congress the authority to set the National Ambient Air Quality Standards and modernize the permitting process under the National Environmental Policy Act so it can no longer invite frivolous lawsuits, thwart sorely needed projects, kill jobs, and strangle growth. The federal government owns or controls over 640 million acres of land in the United States, most of which is in the West. These are public lands, and the public should have access to them for appropriate activities like hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting. Federal ownership or management of land also places an economic burden on counties and local communities in terms of lost revenue to pay for things such as schools, police, and emergency services. It is absurd to think that all that acreage must remain under the absentee ownership or management of official Washington. Congress shall immediately pass universal legislation providing for a timely and orderly mechanism requiring the federal government to convey certain federally controlled public lands to states. We call upon all national and state leaders and representatives to exert their utmost power and influence to urge the transfer of those lands, identified in the review process, to all willing states for the benefit of the states and the nation as a whole. The residents of state and local communities know best how to protect the land where they work and live. They practice boots-on- the-ground conservation in their states every day. We support amending the Antiquities Act of 1906 to establish Congress’ right to approve the designation of national monuments and to further require the approval of the state where a national monument is designated or a national park is proposed. There is certainly a need to protect certain species threatened worldwide with extinction. However, the Endangered Species Act (ESA) should not include species such as gray wolves and other species if these species exist elsewhere in healthy numbers in another state or country. To upset the economic viability of an area with an unneeded designation costs jobs and hurts local communities. We must ensure that this protection is done effectively, reasonably, and without unnecessarily impeding the development of lands and natural resources. The ESA should ensure that the listing of endangered species and the designation of critical habitats are based upon sound science and balance the protection of endangered species with the costs of compliance and the rights of property owners. Instead, over the last few decades, the ESA has stunted economic development, halted the construction of projects, burdened landowners, and has been used to pursue policy goals inconsistent with the ESA — all with little to no success in the actual recovery of species. For example, we oppose the listing of the lesser prairie chicken and the potential listing of the sage grouse. Neither species has been shown to be in actual danger and the listings threaten to devastate farmers, ranchers, and oil and gas production. While species threatened with extinction must be protected under the ESA, any such protection must be done in a reasonable and transparent manner with stakeholder input and in consideration of the impact on the development of lands and natural resources. Information concerning a changing climate, especially projections into the long-range future, must be based on dispassionate analysis of hard data. We will enforce that standard throughout the executive branch, among civil servants and presidential appointees alike. The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a political mechanism, not an unbiased scientific institution. Its unreliability is reflected in its intolerance toward scientists and others who dissent from its orthodoxy. We will evaluate its recommendations accordingly. We reject the agendas of both the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, which represent only the personal commitments of their signatories; no such agreement can be binding upon the United States until it is submitted to and ratified by the Senate. We demand an immediate halt to U.S. funding for the U.N.’s Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in accordance with the 1994 Foreign Relations Authorization Act. That law prohibits Washington from giving any money to ""any affiliated organization of the United Nations” which grants Palestinians membership as a state. There is no ambiguity in that language. It would be illegal for the President to follow through on his intention to provide millions in funding for the UNFCCC and hundreds of millions for its Green Climate Fund. We firmly believe environmental problems are best solved by giving incentives for human ingenuity and the development of new technologies, not through top-down, command-and-control regulations that stifle economic growth and cost thousands of jobs. Government Reform Making Government Work for the People Founding Father and Constitution Framer James Wilson declared that in America, “the people are the masters of government,” but that in other countries, “the government is master of the people.” We pledge to make government work for the people, rather than the other way around. Much of what the federal government does can be improved, much should be replaced, and much needs to be done away with or returned to the states. It is long past time for just tinkering around the edges of a bloated and unresponsive bureaucratic state. Its poorly managed programs, some begun generations ago, are ill-suited to meet present needs and future requirements. Its credit card budgets impose massive indebtedness on every American today and on children yet unborn. The more it intrudes into every aspect of American life the more it alienates the citizens who work, pay taxes, and wonder what has happened to the country they love. We agree with Thomas Jefferson that “[t]he multiplication of public offices, increase of expense beyond income, growth and entailment of a public debt, are indications soliciting the employment of the pruning knife.” Balancing the Budget The federal fiscal burden threatens the security, liberty, and independence of our nation. The current Administration's refusal to work with Republicans took our national debt from $10 trillion to nearly $19 trillion today. Left unchecked, it will hit $30 trillion by 2026. At the same time, the Administration's policies systematically crippled economic growth and job creation, driving up government costs and driving down revenues. When Congressional Republicans tried to reverse course, the Administration manufactured fiscal crises — phony government shutdowns — to demand excessive spending. The Administration's demands have focused on significantly expanding government spending and benefits for its preferred groups, paid for through loans that our children and grandchildren will have to pay. This is the path to bankrupting the next generation. The Republican path to fiscal sanity and economic expansion begins with a constitutional requirement for a federal balanced budget. We will fight for Congress to adopt, and for the states to ratify, a Balanced Budget Amendment which imposes a cap limiting spending to the appropriate historical average percentage of our nation's gross domestic product while requiring a super-majority for any tax increase, with exceptions only for war or legitimate emergencies. Only a constitutional safeguard such as this can prevent deficits from mounting to government default. Republican budgets will prioritize thrift over extravagance and put taxpayers first. We support the following test: Is a particular expenditure within the constitutional scope of the federal government? If not, stop it. Has it been effective in the past and is it still absolutely necessary? If not, end it. Is it so important as to justify borrowing, especially foreign borrowing, to fund it? If not, kill it. Preserving Medicare and Medicaid More than 100 million Americans depend on Medicare or Medicaid for their healthcare; with our population aging, that number will increase. To preserve Medicare and Medicaid, the financing of these important programs must be brought under control before they consume most of the federal budget, including national defense. The good news is that it can be done, and it can be done without endangering the elderly and the needy who depend on those programs. We intend to save Medicare by modernizing it, empowering its participants, and putting it on a secure financial footing. We will preserve the promise of Medicaid as well by making that program, designed for 1965 medicine, a vehicle for good health in an entirely new era. Medicare’s long-term debt is in the trillions, and it is funded by a workforce that is shrinking relative to the size of future beneficiaries. Obamacare worsened the situation — and imperiled seniors — by imposing hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to Medicare providers to pay for its new spending. When a vital program is so clearly headed for a train wreck, it’s time to put it on a more secure track. That is why we propose these reforms: Impose no changes for persons 55 or older. Give others the option of traditional Medicare or transition to a premium-support model designed to strengthen patient choice, promote cost-saving competition among providers, and better guard against the fraud and abuse that now diverts billions of dollars every year away from patient care. Guarantee to every enrollee an income-adjusted contribution toward a plan of their choice, with catastrophic protection. Without disadvantaging present retirees or those nearing retirement, a more realistic age for eligibility in light of today’s longer life span. This is an agenda to improve healthcare, not just to manage its costs. We reject the Democrats’ approach of rationing inherent in Obamacare. We recognize the de facto rationing of healthcare caused by reduced access to doctors who increasingly opt out of participating in Medicare and Medicaid. We will not accept that or any other approach which denies care — or lowers its quality — for America’s elderly. Medicaid presents related, but somewhat different challenges. As the dominant force in the health market with regard to long-term care, births, and persons with mental illness, it is the next frontier of welfare reform. It is simply too big and too flawed to be administered from Washington. Most of the vaunted expansion of health insurance coverage under Obamacare actually has been an unprecedented expansion of the Medicaid rolls in many states. We applaud the Republican governors and state legislators who have undertaken the hard work of modernizing Medicaid. We will give them a free hand to do so by block-granting the program without strings. Their initiatives — whether premium supports for purchasing insurance, refundable tax credits, alternatives to hospitalization for chronic patients, disease prevention activities, and other innovations — are the best strategy for preserving Medicaid for those who need it the most. Block granting Medicaid is particularly needed to address mental health care. Mental illness affects people from all walks of life, but there has been little success in developing effective system-wide medical models for addressing mental health. For a variety of unique reasons, government is often the first frontier for people experiencing mental health problems — from first responders who deal with crises to publicly funded mental health facilities and prisons where large numbers of inmates suffer from mental illnesses. Using block grants would allow states to experiment with different systems to address mental health and develop successful models to be replicated in states across the nation. The current federally dictated mental health care regime is wasteful and ineffective, and moving to a block grant approach would allow for state and local governments to create solutions for individuals and families in desperate need of help in addressing mental illness. We respect the states’ authority and flexibility to exclude abortion providers from federal programs such as Medicaid and other healthcare and family planning programs so long as they continue to perform or refer for elective abortions or sell the body parts of aborted children. Saving Social Security We reject the old maxim that Social Security is the ""Third Rail” of American politics, deadly for anyone who would change it. The Democratic Party still treats it that way, even though everyone knows that its current course will lead to a financial and social disaster. Younger Americans have lost all faith in the program and expect little return for what they are paying into it. As the party of America’s future, we accept the responsibility to preserve and modernize a system of retirement security forged in an old industrial era beyond the memory of most Americans. Current retirees and those close to retirement can be assured of their benefits. Of the many reforms being proposed, all options should be considered to preserve Social Security. As Republicans, we oppose tax increases and believe in the power of markets to create wealth and to help secure the future of our Social Security system. Saving Social Security is more than a challenge. It is our moral obligation to those who trusted in the government's word. Protecting Internet Freedom The survival of the internet as we know it is at risk. Its gravest peril originates in the White House, the current occupant of which has launched a campaign, both at home and internationally, to subjugate it to agents of government. The President ordered the chair of the supposedly independent Federal Communications Commission to impose upon the internet rules devised in the 1930s for the telephone monopoly. He has unilaterally announced America's abandonment of the international internet by surrendering U.S. control of the root zone of web names and addresses. He threw the internet to the wolves, and they - Russia, China, Iran, and others - are ready to devour it. We salute the Congressional Republicans who have legislatively impeded his plans to turn over the Information Freedom Highway to regulators and tyrants. That fight must continue, for its outcome is in doubt. We will consistently support internet policies that allow people and private enterprise to thrive, without providing new and expanded government powers to tax and regulate so that the internet does not become the vehicle for a dramatic expansion of government power. The internet's independence is its power. It has unleashed innovation, enabled growth, and inspired freedom more rapidly and extensively than any other technological advance in human history. We will therefore resist any effort to shift control toward governance by international or other intergovernmental organizations. We will ensure that personal data receives full constitutional protection from government overreach. The only way to safeguard or improve these systems is through the private sector. The internet's free market needs to be free and open to all ideas and competition without the government or service providers picking winners and losers. Immigration and the Rule of Law Our party is the natural home for those who come in search of freedom and justice. We welcome all to the Great Opportunity Party. The greatest asset of the American economy is the American worker. Our immigration system must protect American working families and their wages, for citizens and legal immigrants alike, in a way that will improve the economy. Just as immigrant labor helped build our country in the past, today's legal immigrants are making vital contributions in every aspect of national life. Their industry and commitment to American values strengthens our economy, enriches our culture, and enables us to better understand and more effectively compete with the rest of the world. We are particularly grateful to the thousands of new legal immigrants, many of them not yet citizens, who are serving in the Armed Forces and among first responders. Their patriotism should encourage all to embrace the newcomers legally among us, assist their journey to full citizenship, and help their communities avoid isolation from the mainstream of society. We are also thankful for the many legal immigrants who continue to contribute to American society. To that end, we both encourage the preservation of heritage tongues and support English as the nation's official language, a unifying force essential for the advancement of immigrant communities and our nation as a whole. America's immigration policy must serve the national interest of the United States, and the interests of American workers must be protected over the claims of foreign nationals seeking the same jobs. With all our fellow citizens, we have watched, in anger and disgust, the mocking of our immigration laws by a president who made himself superior to the will of the nation. We stand with the victims of his policies, especially the families of murdered innocents. Illegal immigration endangers everyone, exploits the taxpayers, and insults all who aspire to enter America legally. We oppose any form of amnesty for those who, by breaking the law, have disadvantaged those who have obeyed it. The executive amnesties of 2012 and 2014 are a direct violation of federal law and usurp the powers of Congress as outlined in Article I of the Constitution. These unlawful amnesties must be immediately rescinded by a Republican president. In a time of terrorism, drug cartels, human trafficking, and criminal gangs, the presence of millions of unidentified individuals in this country poses grave risks to the safety and sovereignty of the United States. Our highest priority, therefore, must be to secure our borders and all ports of entry and to enforce our immigration laws. That is why we support building a wall along our southern border and protecting all ports of entry. The border wall must cover the entirety of the southern border and must be sufficient to stop both vehicular and pedestrian traffic. We insist upon workplace enforcement of verification systems so that more jobs can be available to all legal workers. Use of the E-verify program — an internet-based system that verifies the employment authorization and identity of employees — must be made mandatory nationwide. We reaffirm our endorsement of the SAVE program — Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements — to ensure that public funds are not given to persons not legally present in this country. We demand tough penalties against those who engage in identity theft, deal in fraudulent documents, and traffic in human beings. The Department of Homeland Security must use its authority to keep dangerous aliens off our streets and to expedite expulsion of criminal aliens. Gang membership should be a deportable offense. Any previously deported illegal alien who continues to show a lack of respect for our borders and rule of law must be penalized. This is why we support stiffer penalties, such as a mandatory minimum sentence of five years, for any illegal alien who illegally re-enters our nation after already having been deported. Because “sanctuary cities” violate federal law and endanger their own citizens, they should not be eligible for federal funding. Using state licenses to reward people in the country illegally is an affront to the rule of law and must be halted. In light of both current needs and historic practice, we urge the reform of our guest worker programs to eliminate fraud, improve efficiency and ensure they serve the national interest. In light of the alarming levels of unemployment and underemployment in this country, it is indefensible to continue offering lawful permanent residence to more than one million foreign nationals every year. The Supreme Court has correctly recognized that states have the constitutional authority to take steps to reduce illegal immigration. We condemn the Obama Administration’s lawsuits against states that are seeking to reinforce federal law. We support the right of the states to enact laws deterring illegal aliens from residing within their states. From its beginning, our country has been a haven of refuge and asylum. That should continue — but with major changes. Asylum should be limited to cases of political, ethnic or religious persecution. As the Director of the FBI has noted, it is not possible to vet fully all potential refugees. To ensure our national security, refugees who cannot be carefully vetted cannot be admitted to the country, especially those whose homelands have been the breeding grounds for terrorism. Reforming the Treaty System We intend to restore the treaty system specified by the Constitution: The president negotiates agreements, submits them to the Senate, with ratification requiring two-thirds of the senators present and voting. This was good enough for George Washington but is too restrictive for the current chief executive, who presumes to bind this country to bilateral and multilateral agreements of his devising. His media admirers portray his personal commitments — whether on climate change, Iranian weapons, or other matters — as done deals. They are not, and a new Republican executive will work with the Congress to reestablish constitutional order in America’s foreign relations. All international executive agreements and political arrangements entered into by the current Administration must be deemed null and void as mere expressions of the current president’s preferences. Those which are in the national interest but would traditionally have been made by treaty must be abrogated, renegotiated as treaties, and transmitted to the Senate for its advice and consent as required by the Constitution. The United States will withdraw from all agreements and arrangements failing those standards. Internal Revenue Service Many good civil servants work at the IRS, but the agency itself is toxic. Its leadership employs known tax delinquents, rehires workers previously fired for misconduct, spends user fees without congressional oversight, and awards bonuses for customer service that would put any private company out of business. Worst of all, the IRS has become an ideological attack dog for the worst elements of today's Democratic Party. It systematically targets conservative, pro-life, and libertarian organizations, harassing them with repeated audits and denying their tax exempt status. Its commissioner has lied to Congress, hidden evidence, and stonewalled investigations. He should be impeached by the House of Representatives and convicted by the Senate. We value the right of America's churches, pastors, and religious leaders to preach and speak freely according to their faith. Republicans believe the federal government, specifically the IRS, is constitutionally prohibited from policing or censoring the speech of America's churches, pastors, and religious leaders. We support repeal of the Johnson Amendment, which restricts First Amendment freedoms of all nonprofit organizations by prohibiting political speech. We also support making the federal tax code so simple and easy to understand that the IRS becomes obsolete and can be abolished. Audit the Pentagon No major part of the Department of Defense has ever passed an audit. Republican leaders in Congress have called for a full financial audit of the Pentagon to ensure that every dollar spent is truly benefitting our national security. Every taxpayer must be prepared to pass an audit, and we urge Congress to demand the same level of accountability from the Pentagon and the Department of Defense. Improving the Federal Workforce We recognize the dedication of most employees of the federal government and thank them for their service, with special praise for the whistleblowers who risk their careers to expose waste, fraud, and misuse of power. None of them should ever be compelled to join a union or pay dues to it. In fairness to their fellow workers, union representatives should not be allowed to engage in union-related activities while on the public's time. The inability of federal managers to discipline and, if necessary, dismiss problem staff members is an affront to every conscientious worker, as is the misuse of funds for lavish conferences and routine bonuses. The appointees of a Republican president will work with career managers to end those abuses and enforce high standards for all federal employees. We reaffirm the existing protections that provide all employees of the federal government the opportunity to pursue their desire to serve their country free from discrimination. We call for renewed efforts to reduce, rather than expand, government responsibilities, and we urge particular attention to the bloated public relations budgets of the departments and agencies. The federal government spends too much of the people's money telling the people what they should do. Advancing Term Limits Our national platform has repeatedly endorsed term limits for Members of Congress. In response, the GOP Leadership in 1996 brought to a vote, in both the House and Senate, a constitutional amendment. It failed to secure the necessary two-thirds vote in the House, where 80 percent of Republicans voted for it and 80 percent of Democrats voted against it. Every Senate Republican voted to allow a vote on term limits, but the Democrats killed it by a filibuster. Blocked by that opposition, Republicans sought other ways to modernize the national legislature. They set term limits for their own committee chairs and leadership positions, and by law they required Congress to live by the same rules it imposes on others. To make further progress, to advance a constitutional amendment for consideration by the states, we must expand the current Republican majorities in both chambers. Regulation: The Quiet Tyranny Over-regulation is the quiet tyranny of the ""Nanny State.” It hamstrings American businesses and hobbles economic growth. The Great Recession may be over, but in the experience of most Americans, the economy is still sick. The federal regulatory burden has been a major contributor to that stagnation. The ability of the American people to govern themselves has been undermined by a vast array of agencies with sweeping power to regulate every aspect of American life. They legislate as if they were Congress. They decide guilt and issue penalties as if they were courts. They collectively impose many billions of dollars in costs to the economy. The current President and his allies on Capitol Hill have used those agencies as a superlegislature, disregarding the separation of powers, to declare as law what they could not push through the Congress. The Environmental Protection Agency has rewritten laws to advance the Democrats’ climate change agenda. The Department of Health and Human Services has ignored the enacted text of the Affordable Care Act to do whatever it wants in healthcare. Both the Department of Labor and National Labor Relations Board have scrapped decades of labor law to implement the agenda of big labor. The Dodd-Frank law, the Democrats’ legislative Godzilla, is crushing small and community banks and other lenders. The Federal Communications Commission is imperiling the freedom of the internet. We support reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 which prohibits commercial banks from engaging in high-risk investment. Sensible regulations can be compatible with a vibrant economy. They can prevent the strong from exploiting the weak. Right now, the regulators are exploiting everyone. We are determined to make regulations minimally intrusive, confined to their legal mandate, and respectful toward the creation of new and small businesses. We will revisit existing laws that delegate too much authority to regulatory agencies and review all current regulations for possible reform or repeal. We endorse Republican legislation, already passed by the House, to require approval by both houses of Congress for any rule or regulation that would impose significant costs on the American people. Further, Congress should work towards legislation that requires removal of a regulation of equal or greater economic burden when a new regulation is enacted. Because regulations are just another tax on the consumers, Congress should consider a regulatory budget that would cap the costs federal agencies could impose on the economy in any given year. Crony Capitalism and Corporate Welfare Cronyism is inherent in the progressive vision of the administrative state. When government uses taxpayer funding and resources to give special advantages to private companies, it distorts the free market and erodes public trust in our political system. By enlarging the scope of government and placing enormous power in the hands of bureaucrats, it multiplies opportunities for corruption and favoritism. It is the enemy of reform in education, the workplace, and healthcare. It gives us financial regulation that protects the large at the cost of the small. It is inherent in every part of the current healthcare law, which is packed with corporate welfare. Crony capitalism gives us special interest tax breaks, custom-designed regulations, and special exemptions for favored parties. The Solyndra debacle is a perfect example. It creates both subsidies and restrictions to tilt the market one way or the other. By putting the weight of government behind the status quo, it leads to economic stagnation. We applaud the Republican Members of Congress who have taken the lead in fighting crony capitalism and urge others to rally to their cause. Honoring Our Relationship with American Indians Based on both treaty and other law, the federal government has a unique government-to- government relationship with and trust responsibility for Indian Tribal Governments, American Indians, and Alaska Natives. These obligations have not been sufficiently honored. The social and economic problems that plague Indian country have grown worse over the last several decades; we must reverse that trend. Ineffective federal programs deprive American Indians of the services they need, and long-term failures threaten to undermine tribal sovereignty itself. American Indians have established elected tribal governments to carry out the public policies of the tribe, administer services to its tribal member constituents, and manage relations with federal, state, and local governments. We respect the tribal governments as the voice of their communities and encourage federal, state, and local governments to heed those voices in developing programs and partnerships to improve the quality of life for American Indians and their neighbors in their communities. Republicans believe that economic self-sufficiency is the ultimate answer to the challenges confronting Indian country. We believe that tribal governments and their communities, not Washington bureaucracies, are best situated to craft solutions that will end systemic problems that create poverty and disenfranchisement. Just as the federal government should not burden states with regulations, it should not stifle the development of resources within the reservations, which need federal assistance to advance their commerce nationally through roads and technology. Federal and state regulations that thwart job creation must be withdrawn or redrawn so that tribal governments acting on behalf of American Indians are not disadvantaged. It is especially egregious that the Democratic Party has persistently undermined tribal sovereignty in order to provide advantage to union bosses in the tribal workplace. Native communities should have the same authority as state governments in labor matters, so that union bosses and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) cannot undermine the authority of tribal governments. Republicans recognize that each tribe has the right of consultation before any new regulatory policy is implemented on tribal land. To the extent possible, such consultation should take place in Indian country with the tribal government and its members. Before promulgating and imposing any new laws or regulations affecting trust land or members, the federal government should encourage Indian tribes to develop their own policies to achieve program objectives, and should defer to tribes to develop their own standards, or standards in conjunction with state governments. Republicans reject a one-size-fits-all approach to federal-tribal-state partnerships and will work to expand local autonomy where tribal governments seek it. Better partnerships will help us to expand economic opportunity, deliver top-flight education to future generations, modernize and improve the Indian Health Service to make it more responsive to local needs, and build essential infrastructure in Indian country in cooperation with tribal neighbors. Our approach is to empower American Indians, through tribal self-determination and selfgovernance policies, to develop their greatest assets, human resources and the rich natural resources on their lands, without undue federal interference. Like all Americans, American Indians want safe communities for their families; but inadequate resources and neglect have, over time, allowed criminal activities to plague Indian country. To protect everyone — and especially the most vulnerable: children, women, and elders — the legal system in tribal communities must provide stability and protect property rights. Everyone's due process and civil rights must be safeguarded. We support efforts to ensure equitable participation in federal programs by American Indians, including Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians, and to preserve their culture and languages that we consider to be national treasures. Lastly, we recognize that American Indians have responded to the call for military service in percentage numbers far greater than have other groups of Americans. We honor that commitment, loyalty, and sacrifice of all American Indians serving in the military today and in years past and will ensure that all veterans and their families receive the care and respect they have earned through their loyal service to America. Americans in the Territories Throughout the history of our nation, the patriotism exhibited by our brothers and sisters in the territories of Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico has often gone unacknowledged. Year after year, the citizens quietly, without fanfare, send their sons and daughters into the U.S. Armed Services. We honor the extraordinary sacrifices of the men and women of the territories who protect our freedom through their service in the U.S. Armed Forces. Geographically, the territories and commonwealths, especially those in the Pacific, are of vital importance to our national security as the outermost line of defense and gateway to America against potential encroachment by foreign powers. We welcome their greater participation in all aspects of the political process and affirm their right to seek the full extension of the Constitution with all the rights and responsibilities that entails. We recognize the challenges facing all the U.S. territories in an era of dramatic global economic change. They need venture capital to retain existing industries and develop new ones. A stronger private sector can reduce dependence on public employment and lead toward self-sufficiency. Their development of local energy options will be crucial to reduce dependence on costly imported fuel. The territories’ economic stability and potential for growth must be considered in any trade agreements between the United States and other Pacific nations. They should be given flexibility or exemption from laws that increase costs for their populations, such as the minimum wage and the Jones Act concerning shipping. All unreasonable impediments to their prosperity should be removed, including unreasonable U.S. customs practices. Territories such as American Samoa should be able to properly develop their resources, including fishing, when jobs and the economy depend on it. We call for the appointment of a commonwealth and territories advisory committee consisting of representatives from all five U.S. territories. The committee will be integrated into the president’s transition team and be tasked with performing a holistic review of all federal regulations affecting the territories and commonwealths. We further call for the appointment of a Special Assistant to the President responsible for day-to-day interaction with the territories and commonwealths. This position will be the direct connection for the Office of Insular Affairs, the citizens of the territories and commonwealths, and the White House. The Territory of Puerto Rico We support the right of the United States citizens of Puerto Rico to be admitted to the Union as a fully sovereign state. We further recognize the historic significance of the 2012 local referendum in which a 54 percent majority voted to end Puerto Rico’s current status as a U.S. territory, and 61 percent chose statehood over options for sovereign nationhood. We support the federally sponsored political status referendum authorized and funded by an Act of Congress in 2014 to ascertain the aspirations of the people of Puerto Rico. Once the 2012 local vote for statehood is ratified, Congress should approve an enabling act with terms for Puerto Rico’s future admission as the 51st state of the Union. Preserving the District of Columbia The nation’s capital city is a special responsibility of the federal government because it belongs both to its residents and to all Americans, millions of whom visit it every year. Congressional Republicans have fostered homeownership and open access to higher education for Washington residents. Against the opposition of the current President and leaders of the Democratic Party, they have established and expanded the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program, through which thousands of low-income children have been able to attend a school of their choice and receive a quality education. Republicans have been in the forefront of combating chronic corruption among the city’s top Democratic officials. We call for congressional action to enforce the spirit of the Home Rule Act, assuring minority representation on the City Council. That council, backed by the current mayor, is attempting to seize from the Congress its appropriating power over all funding for the District. The illegality of their action mirrors the unacceptable spike in violent crime and murders currently afflicting the city. We expect Congress to assert, by whatever means necessary, its constitutional prerogatives regarding the District. Since the Supreme Court’s decisions affirming the Second Amendment rights of its citizens, city officials have engaged in a campaign of massive resistance by denying virtually all applications for gun ownership. The Republican Congress should be prepared, upon the inauguration of a Republican president, to enact legislation allowing law-abiding Washingtonians to own and carry firearms. Statehood for the District can be advanced only by a constitutional amendment. Any other approach would be invalid. A statehood amendment was soundly rejected by the states when last proposed in 1976 and should not be revived. Great American Families, Education, Healthcare, and Criminal Justice American Values We are the party of independent individuals and the institutions they create together — families, schools, congregations, neighborhoods — to advance their ideals and make real their dreams. Those institutions, standing between the citizen and the power of government, are the pillars of a free society. They create spaces where the power of government should not intrude. They allow Americans to work together to solve most of the problems facing their communities. They thus reduce the need for intervention by government in the form of more and bigger programs or a larger public workforce. They minimize decision-making by those who hold or are appointed to office. That is precisely why today’s progressives distrust and seek to control them — because this is more than a conflict of ideas. It is a struggle for power. Our society is at a crossroads. For several generations, an expansive federal regime has marginalized and supplanted the institutions holding our society together. No wonder, then, that so much seems to be coming apart now. The question is whether we are going to reinvigorate the private- sector institutions under citizen control or allow their continued erosion by the forces of centralized social planning. In that divide, the Republican Party stands with the people. Marriage, Family, and Society Foremost among those institutions is the American family. It is the foundation of civil society, and the cornerstone of the family is natural marriage, the union of one man and one woman. Its daily lessons — cooperation, patience, mutual respect, responsibility, self-reliance — are fundamental to the order and progress of our Republic. Strong families, depending upon God and one another, advance the cause of liberty by lessening the need for government in their daily lives. Conversely, as we have learned over the last five decades, the loss of faith and family life leads to greater dependence upon government. That is why Republicans formulate public policy, from taxation to education, from healthcare to welfare, with attention to the needs and strengths of the family. It is also why everyone should be concerned about the state of the American family today, not because of ideology or doctrine, but because of the overwhelming evidence of experience, social science, and common sense. All of which give us these truths about traditional marriage: Children raised in a two-parent household tend to be physically and emotionally healthier, more likely to do well in school, less likely to use drugs and alcohol, engage in crime or become pregnant outside of marriage. We oppose policies and laws that create a financial incentive for or encourage cohabitation. Moreover, marriage remains the greatest antidote to child poverty. The 40 percent of children who now are born outside of marriage are five times more likely to live in poverty than youngsters born and raised by a mother and father in the home. Nearly three-quarters of the $450 billion government annually spends on welfare goes to single-parent households. This is what it takes for a governmental village to raise a child, and the village is doing a tragically poor job of it. The data and the facts lead to an inescapable conclusion: Every child deserves a married mom and dad. The reality remains that millions of American families do not have the advantages that come with that structure. We honor the courageous efforts of those who bear the burdens of parenting alone and embrace the principle that all Americans should be treated with dignity and respect. But respect is not enough. Our laws and our government's regulations should recognize marriage as the union of one man and one woman and actively promote married family life as the basis of a stable and prosperous society. For that reason, as explained elsewhere in this platform, we do not accept the Supreme Court’s redefinition of marriage and we urge its reversal, whether through judicial reconsideration or a constitutional amendment returning control over marriage to the states. We oppose government discrimination against businesses or entities which decline to sell items or services to individuals for activities that go against their religious views about such activities. Families formed or enlarged by adoption strengthen our communities and ennoble our nation. Private entities which facilitate adoptions enrich our communities. We support measures such as the First Amendment Defense Act to ensure these entities do not face government discrimination because of their views on marriage and family. We applaud the Republican initiatives which have led to an increase in adoptions, an achievement which should be recognized in any restructuring of the federal tax code. While the number of children in foster care has stabilized, teens who age out of that setting often are abruptly left to face the world on their own. We urge states and community groups to help these young adults become independent. Thirty years ago, President Reagan commissioned a Special Working Group on the Family to study how government at all levels could be more supportive of family life. We urge marriage penalties to be removed from the tax code and public assistance programs. We invite all who care about children to join us in this proposal to ensure that all federal programs, in the words of President Kennedy, “stress the integrity and preservation of the family unit.” A Culture of Hope We have been fighting the War on Poverty for 50 years and poverty is winning. Our social safety net — about 80 separate means-tested programs costing over $1 trillion every year — is designed to help people born into or falling into poverty. It rarely lifts them out. Its apologists judge success by the amount of money spent to keep people in the system. That is a cruel measurement. Republicans propose to evaluate a poverty program by whether it actually reduces poverty and increases the personal independence of its participants. The results are damning: intergenerational poverty has persisted and worsened since 1966. This year marks another important anniversary; it has been 20 years since the landmark Republican welfare reform of 1996 broke away from the discredited Great Society model. By making welfare a benefit instead of an entitlement, it put millions of recipients on a transition from dependence to independence. Welfare rolls declined by half as recipients and prospective recipients discovered a better way to reach their goals. Best of all, about 3 million children moved out of poverty. Today that progress has been lost. Defying the law as it was plainly written, the current Administration has nullified any meaningful work requirement and made TANF a mockery of the name we gave it: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. This decision ensures that those families will remain needy and cut off from the economic mainstream of American society. This is the progressive pathology: Keeping people dependent so that government can redistribute income. The result is 45.8 million people on food stamps and 77 million on Medicaid, plus another 5.7 million in the Children’s Health Insurance Program. This is the false compassion of the status quo. We propose instead the dynamic compassion of work requirements in a growing economy, where opportunity takes the place of a hand-out, where true self-esteem can grow from the satisfaction of a job well done. We call for removal of structural impediments which progressives throw in the path of poor people: Over-regulation of start-up enterprises, excessive licensing requirements, needless restrictions on formation of schools and day-care centers serving neighborhood families, and restrictions on providing public services in fields like transport and sanitation that close the opportunity door to all but a favored few. We will continue our fight for school choice until all parents can find good, safe schools for their children. To protect religious liberty we will ensure that faith-based institutions, especially those that are vital parts of underserved neighborhoods, do not face discrimination by government. We propose new partnerships between those who manage federal programs and those who are on the front lines of fighting poverty on the ground. We must encourage their efforts to reclaim their communities from the culture of poverty. To advance this process, we urge greater state and local responsibility for, and control over, public assistance programs. Education: A Chance for Every Child Education is much more than schooling. It is the whole range of activities by which families and communities transmit to a younger generation, not just knowledge and skills, but ethical and behavioral norms and traditions. It is the handing over of a cultural identity. That is why American education has, for the last several decades, been the focus of constant controversy, as centralizing forces from outside the family and community have sought to remake education in order to remake America. They have done immense damage. The federal government should not be a partner in that effort, as the Constitution gives it no role in education. At the heart of the American Experiment lies the greatest political expression of human dignity: The self- evident truth that ""all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.” That truth rejects the dark view of the individual as human capital — a possession for the creation of another's wealth. Parents are a child's first and foremost educators, and have primary responsibility for the education of their children. Parents have a right to direct their children's education, care, and upbringing. We support a constitutional amendment to protect that right from interference by states, the federal government, or international bodies such as the United Nations. We reject a one- size-fits-all approach to education and support a broad range of choices for parents and children at the state and local level. We likewise repeat our longstanding opposition to the imposition of national standards and assessments, encourage the parents and educators who are implementing alternatives to Common Core, and congratulate the states which have successfully repealed it. Their education reform movement calls for choice-based, parent-driven accountability at every stage of schooling. It affirms higher expectations for all students and rejects the crippling bigotry of low expectations. It recognizes the wisdom of local control of our schools and it wisely sees consumer rights in education — choice — as the most important driving force for renewing education. It rejects excessive testing and ""teaching to the test” and supports the need for strong assessments to serve as a tool so teachers can tailor teaching to meet student needs. We applaud America’s great teachers, who should be protected against frivolous lawsuits and should be able to take reasonable actions to maintain discipline and order in the classroom. Administrators need flexibility to innovate and to hold accountable all those responsible for student performance. A good understanding of the Bible being indispensable for the development of an educated citizenry, we encourage state legislatures to offer the Bible in a literature curriculum as an elective in America’s high schools. We urge school districts to make use of teaching talent in the business community, STEM fields, and the military, especially among our returning veterans. Rigid tenure systems should be replaced with a merit-based approach in order to attract the best talent to the classroom. All personnel who interact with school children should pass background checks and be held to the highest standards of personal conduct. Academic Excellence for All Maintaining American preeminence requires a world-class system of education in which all students can reach their potential. Republicans are leading the effort to create it. Since 1965, the federal government, through more than 100 programs in the Department of Education, has spent $2 trillion on elementary and secondary education with little substantial improvement in academic achievement or high school graduation rates. The United States spends an average of more than $12,000 per pupil per year in public schools, for a total of more than $620 billion. That represents more than 4 percent of GDP devoted to K-12 education in 2011-2012. Of that amount, federal spending amounted to more than $57 billion. Clearly, if money were the solution, our schools would be problem-free. More money alone does not necessarily equal better performance. After years of trial and error, we know the policies and methods that have actually made a difference in student advancement: Choice in education; building on the basics; STEM subjects and phonics; career and technical education; ending social promotions; merit pay for good teachers; classroom discipline; parental involvement; and strong leadership by principals, superintendents, and locally elected school boards. Because technology has become an essential tool of learning, it must be a key element in our efforts to provide every child equal access and opportunity. We strongly encourage instruction in American history and civics by using the original documents of our founding fathers. Choice in Education We support options for learning, including home-schooling, career and technical education, private or parochial schools, magnet schools, charter schools, online learning, and early-college high schools. We especially support the innovative financing mechanisms that make options available to all children: education savings accounts (ESAs), vouchers, and tuition tax credits. Empowering families to access the learning environments that will best help their children to realize their full potential is one of the greatest civil rights challenges of our time. A young person’s ability to succeed in school must be based on his or her God-given talent and motivation, not an address, ZIP code, or economic status. We propose that the bulk of federal money through Title I for low-income children and through IDEA for children with special needs should follow the child to whatever school the family thinks will work best for them. In sum, on the one hand enormous amounts of money are being spent for K-12 public education with overall results that do not justify that spending level. On the other hand, the common experience of families, teachers, and administrators forms the basis of what does work in education. In Congress and in the states, Republicans are bridging the gap between those two realities. Congressional Republicans are leading the way forward with major reform legislation advancing the concept of block grants and repealing numerous federal regulations which have interfered with state and local control of public schools. Their Workplace Innovation and Opportunity Act — modernizing workforce programs, repealing mandates, and advancing employment for persons with disabilities — is now law. Their legislation to require transparency in unfunded mandates imposed upon our schools is advancing. Their D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program should be expanded as a model for the rest of the country. We deplore the efforts of Congressional Democrats and the current President to eliminate this successful program for disadvantaged students in order to placate the leaders of the teachers’ unions. To ensure that all students have access to the mainstream of American life, we support the English First approach and oppose divisive programs that limit students’ ability to advance in American society. We renew our call for replacing “family planning” programs for teens with sexual risk avoidance education that sets abstinence until marriage as the responsible and respected standard of behavior. That approach — the only one always effective against premarital pregnancy and sexually-transmitted disease — empowers teens to achieve optimal health outcomes. We oppose school-based clinics that provide referral or counseling for abortion and contraception and believe that federal funds should not be used in mandatory or universal mental health, psychiatric, or socio-emotional screening programs. The federal government has pushed states to collect and share vast amounts of personal student and family data, including the collection of social and emotional data. Much of this data is collected without parental consent or notice. This is wholly incompatible with the American Experiment and our inalienable rights. Title IX We emphatically support the original, authentic meaning of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. It affirmed that “no person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” That language opened up for girls and women a world of opportunities that had too often been denied to them. That same provision of law is now being used by bureaucrats — and by the current President of the United States — to impose a social and cultural revolution upon the American people by wrongly redefining sex discrimination to include sexual orientation or other categories. Their agenda has nothing to do with individual rights; it has everything to do with power. They are determined to reshape our schools — and our entire society — to fit the mold of an ideology alien to America's history and traditions. Their edict to the states concerning restrooms, locker rooms, and other facilities is at once illegal, dangerous, and ignores privacy issues. We salute the several states which have filed suit against it. Sexual assault is a terrible crime. We commend the good-faith efforts by law enforcement, educational institutions, and their partners to address that crime responsibly. Whenever reported, it must be promptly investigated by civil authorities and prosecuted in a courtroom, not a faculty lounge. Questions of guilt or innocence must be decided by a judge and jury, with guilt determined beyond a reasonable doubt. Those convicted of sexual assault should be punished to the full extent of the law. The Administration's distortion of Title IX to micromanage the way colleges and universities deal with allegations of abuse contravenes our country's legal traditions and must be halted before it further muddles this complex issue and prevents the proper authorities from investigating and prosecuting sexual assault effectively with due process. Improving Higher Education Our colleges, universities, and trade schools, large and small, public and private, form the world's greatest assemblage of learning. They drive much of the research that keeps America competitive and, by admitting large numbers of foreign students, convey our values and culture to the world. Their excellence is undermined by an ideological bias deeply entrenched within the current university system. Whatever the solution may be in private institutions, in state schools the trustees have a responsibility to the taxpayers to ensure that their enormous investment is not abused for political indoctrination. We call on state officials to preserve our public colleges, universities, and trade schools as places of learning and the exchange of ideas, not zones of intellectual intolerance or “safe zones,” as if college students need protection from the free exchange of ideas. A student's First Amendment rights do not end at the schoolhouse gates. Colleges, universities, and trade schools must not infringe on their freedom of speech and association in the name of political correctness. We condemn the campus-based BDS (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions) campaign against Israel. It is antiSemitism and should be denounced by advocates of academic freedom. College Costs The cost of a college education has long been on an unsustainable trajectory, rising year by year far ahead of inflation. Nationwide, student debt now exceeds credit card debt with average debt levels per student totaling roughly $27,000. Delinquency rates on student loans are now as high as they were on subprime mortgages during the housing crisis. Over half of recent college grads are unemployed or underemployed, working at jobs for which their expensive educations gave them no preparation. We need new systems of learning to compete with traditional four-year schools: Technical institutions, online universities, life-long learning, and work- based learning in the private sector. Public policy should advance their affordability, innovation, and transparency and should recognize that a four-year degree from a brick-and-mortar institution is not the only path toward a prosperous and fulfilling career. The federal government should not be in the business of originating student loans. In order to bring down college costs and give students access to a multitude of financing options, private sector participation in student financing should be restored. Any regulation that increases college costs must be challenged to balance its worth against its negative economic impact on students and their families. In order to encourage new modes of higher education delivery to enter the market, accreditation should be decoupled from federal financing, and states should be empowered to allow a wide array of accrediting and credentialing bodies to operate. This model would foster innovation, bring private industry into the credentialing market, and give students the ability to customize their college experience. Restoring Patient Control and Preserving Quality in Healthcare Any honest agenda for improving healthcare must start with repeal of the dishonestly named Affordable Care Act of 2010: Obamacare. It weighs like the dead hand of the past upon American medicine. It imposed a Euro-style bureaucracy to manage its unworkable, budget-busting, conflicting provisions. It has driven up prices for all consumers. Their insurance premiums have dramatically increased while their deductibles have risen about eight times faster than wages in the last ten years. It drove up drug prices by levying a $27 billion tax on manufacturers and importers and, through mandated price cuts for drugs under Medicare and Medicaid, forced pharmaceutical companies to raise prices for everyone else. Its ""silver plans,” the most common option on the government insurance exchanges, limit people’s access to their own doctor through narrow networks and restrict drug coverage, forcing many patients to pay for extremely costly medicines for their chronic diseases. We agree with the four dissenting judges of the Supreme Court: “In our view, the entire Act before us is invalid in its entirety.” It must be removed and replaced with an approach based on genuine competition, patient choice, excellent care, wellness, and timely access to treatment. To that end, a Republican president, on the first day in office, will use legitimate waiver authority under the law to halt its advance and then, with the unanimous support of Congressional Republicans, will sign its repeal. The Supreme Court upheld Obamacare based on Congress’ power to tax. It is time to repeal Obamacare and give America a much-needed tax cut. In its place we must combine what worked best in the past with changes needed for the future. We must recover the traditional patient-physician relationship based on mutual trust, informed consent, and confidentiality. To simplify the system for both patients and providers, we will reduce mandates and enable insurers and providers of care to increase healthcare options and contain costs. Our goal is to ensure that all Americans have improved access to affordable, high-quality healthcare, including those struggling with mental illness. We will return to the states their historic role of regulating local insurance markets, limit federal requirements on both private insurance and Medicaid, and call on state officials to reconsider the costly medical mandates, imposed under their own laws, that price millions of low-income families out of the insurance market. To guarantee first-rate care for the needy, we propose to block grant Medicaid and other payments and to assist all patients, including those with pre-existing conditions, to obtain coverage in a robust consumer market. Through Obamacare, the current Administration has promoted the notion of abortion as healthcare. We, however, affirm the dignity of women by protecting the sanctity of human life. Numerous studies have shown that abortion endangers the health and wellbeing of women, and we stand firmly against it. To ensure vigorous competition in healthcare, and because cost-awareness is the best guard against over-utilization, we will promote price transparency so consumers can know the cost of treatments before they agree to them. We will empower individuals and small businesses to form purchasing pools in order to expand coverage to the uninsured. We believe that individuals with preexisting conditions who maintain continuous coverage should be protected from discrimination. We applaud the advance of technology in electronic medical records while affirming patient privacy and ownership of personal health information. Consumer choice is the most powerful factor in healthcare reform. Today’s highly mobile workforce needs portability of insurance coverage that can go with them from job to job. The need to maintain coverage should not dictate where families have to live and work. We propose to end tax discrimination against the individual purchase of insurance and allow consumers to buy insurance across state lines. In light of that, we propose repealing the 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act which protects insurance companies from anti-trust litigation. We look to the growth of Health Savings Accounts and Health Reimbursement Accounts that empower patients and advance choice in healthcare. Our aging population must have access to safe and affordable care. Because most seniors desire to age at home, we will make homecare a priority in public policy and will implement programs to protect against elder abuse. Protecting Individual Conscience in Healthcare America's healthcare professionals should not be forced to choose between following their faith and practicing their profession. We respect the rights of conscience of healthcare professionals, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and organizations, especially the faith-based groups which provide a major portion of care for the nation and the needy. We support the ability of all organizations to provide, purchase, or enroll in healthcare coverage consistent with their religious, moral, or ethical convictions without discrimination or penalty. We support the right of parents to determine the proper medical treatment and therapy for their minor children. We support the right of parents to consent to medical treatment for their minor children and urge enactment of legislation that would require parental consent for their daughter to be transported across state lines for abortion. Providers should not be permitted to unilaterally withhold services because a patient's life is deemed not worth living. American taxpayers should not be forced to fund abortion. As Democrats abandon this four decade-old bipartisan consensus, we call for codification of the Hyde Amendment and its application across the government, including Obamacare. We call for a permanent ban on federal funding and subsidies for abortion and healthcare plans that include abortion coverage. Better Care and Lower Costs: Tort Reform Medical malpractice lawsuits have ballooned the cost of healthcare for everyone by forcing physicians to practice defensive medicine through tests and treatments which otherwise might be optional. Rural America is especially affected as obstetricians, surgeons, and other providers move to urban settings or retire in the face of escalating insurance premiums. Many Republican Governors have advanced the legal reforms necessary to reverse that trend. We support state and federal legislation to cap non-economic damages in medical malpractice lawsuits, thereby relieving conscientious providers of burdens that are not rightly theirs and addressing a serious cause of higher medical bills. Advancing Research and Development in Healthcare American medicine is poised to enter a new era of technological advance. Federal and private investment in basic and applied biomedical research holds enormous promise, especially with diseases and disorders like autism, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's. Just as we today take for granted wonders that seemed impossible a few decades ago MRIs and CAT scans, robotic surgery, and in utero treatment — patients a decade hence will have care and treatment that will make much of today's medicine look primitive. Modern miracles involving genetics, the immune system, cures for deadly diseases, and more are in the research pipeline. This is the consequence of marrying significant investment, both public and private, with the world's best talent, a formula that has for a century given the American people the world's best healthcare. We are determined that it should continue to do so, especially as we confront new dangers like Ebola, Zika, Chikungunya, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens. To continue our headway against breast and prostate cancer, diabetes, and other killers, research must consider the needs of formerly neglected demographic groups. We call for expanded support for the stem cell research that now offers the greatest hope for many afflictions through adult stem cells, umbilical cord blood, and cells reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells — without the destruction of embryonic human life. We urge a ban on human cloning for research or reproduction, and a ban on the creation of, or experimentation on, human embryos for research. We applaud Congress’ ban on the FDA approval of research involving three-parent embryos. We believe the FDA’s approval of Mifeprex, a dangerous abortifacient formerly known as RU-486, threatens women’s health, as does the agency’s endorsement of over-the-counter sales of powerful contraceptives without a physician’s recommendation. We support cutting federal and state funding for entities that endanger women’s health by performing abortions in a manner inconsistent with federal or state law. Putting Patients First: Reforming the FDA The United States has led life sciences and medical innovation for decades, bringing millions of high-paying jobs to our country and helping Americans and people around the world live longer, healthier lives. Unfortunately, the continuously increasing burden of governmental regulation and red tape is taking its toll on our innovative companies, and their pipeline of new life-saving devices and drugs to our nation’s patients is slowing and diminishing. The FDA has slowly but relentlessly changed into an agency that more and more puts the public health at risk by delaying, chilling, and killing the development of new devices, drugs and biologics that can promote our lives and our health. The FDA needs leadership that can reform the agency for our century and fix the lack of predictability, consistency, transparency and efficiency at the agency. The FDA needs to return to its traditional emphasis on hard science and approving new breakthrough medicines, rather than divert its attention and consume its resources trying to overregulate electronic health records or vaping. We pledge to restore the FDA to its position as the premier scientific health agency, focused on both promoting and protecting the public health in equal measure, so we can ensure that Americans live longer, healthier lives, that the United States remains the world leader in life sciences and medical innovation, that millions of high-paying, cutting-edge device and drug jobs stay in the United States, that U.S. patients benefit first and most from new devices and drugs, and that the FDA no longer wastes U.S. taxpayer and innovators’ resources through bureaucratic red tape and legal uncertainty. We commend those states that have passed Right to Try legislation, allowing terminally ill patients the right to try investigational medicines not yet approved by the FDA. We urge Congress to pass federal legislation to give all Americans with terminal illnesses the right to try. Advancing Americans with Disabilities Under the last two Republican presidents, landmark civil rights legislation affirmed the inherent rights of persons with disabilities. Republicans want to support those rights by guaranteeing access to education and the tools necessary to compete in the mainstream of society. This is not just a moral obligation to our fellow Americans with disabilities. It is our duty to our country’s future to tap this vast pool of talented individuals who want to work and contribute to the common good. For that reason, Republican leadership led to enactment of the ABLE Act (Achieving a Better Life Experience) and the Steve Gleason Act. The former, for the first time, lets people with disabilities maintain access to services while saving to develop assets. The latter, bearing the name of the former NFL player with ALS, provides access to speech-generating devices. In addition, our Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act will make it easier for students with disabilities to pursue competitive employment. Persons with disabilities are nearly twice as likely to be self-employed as the general population. To encourage their entrepreneurship, it makes sense to include them in the Small Business Administration’s 8(a) certification program, which opens up federal contracting for emerging businesses. Any restructuring of the tax code should consider ways in which companies can benefit from the talent and energy of their disabled employees. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) has opened up unprecedented opportunities for many students. Congressional Republicans will lead in its reauthorization, as well as renewal of the Higher Education Act, which can offer students with disabilities increased access to the general curriculum. Our TIME Act (Transition to Integrated and Meaningful Employment) will modernize the Fair Labor Standards Act to encourage competitive employment for persons with disabilities. We affirm our support for its goal of minimizing the separation of children with disabilities from their peers. We endorse efforts like Employment First that replace dependency with jobs in the mainstream of the American workforce. We oppose the non-consensual withholding of care or treatment from people with disabilities, including newborns, the elderly, and infirm, just as we oppose euthanasia and assisted suicide, which endanger especially those on the margins of society. We urge the Drug Enforcement Administration to restore its ban on the use of controlled substances for physician-assisted suicide. Ensuring Safe Neighborhoods: Criminal Justice and Prison Reform The men and women of law enforcement — whether patrolling our neighborhoods or our borders, fighting organized crime or guarding against domestic terror — deserve our gratitude and support. Their jobs are never easy, especially in crisis situations, and should not be made more difficult by politicized second-guessing from federal officials. The current Administration’s lack of respect for them, from White House intervention in local arrests to the Attorney General’s present campaign of harassment against police forces around the country, has been unprecedented. With all Americans, we mourn those whom we have lost to violence and hatred. To honor their sacrifice, we recommit ourselves, as individuals and as a party, to the rule of law and the pursuit of justice. The conduct of the Department of Justice has included refusal to enforce laws, stonewalling congressional committees, destroying evidence, reckless dealing with firearms that led to several deaths on both sides of our border, and defying a citation for contempt. It has urged leniency for rioters while turning a blind eye to mob attacks on peaceful citizens exercising their political rights. A new administration must ensure the immediate dismissal and, where appropriate, prosecution of any Department officials who have violated their oath of office. The next president must restore the public’s trust in law enforcement and civil order by first adhering to the rule of law himself. Additionally, the next president must not sow seeds of division and distrust between the police and the people they have sworn to serve and protect. The Republican Party, a party of law and order, must make clear in words and action that every human life matters. Two grave problems undermine the rule of law on the federal level: Over-criminalization and over-federalization. In the first case, Congress and federal agencies have increased the number of criminal offenses in the U.S. Code from 3,000 in the early 1980s to more than 4,500 today. That does not include an estimated 300,000 regulations containing criminal penalties. No one, including the Department of Justice, can come up with accurate numbers. That recklessness is bad enough when committed by Congress, but when it comes from the unelected bureaucrats of the federal agencies, it is intolerable. The power of career civil servants and political appointees to criminalize behavior is one of the worst violations of constitutional order perpetrated by the administrative state. To deal with this morass, we urge caution in the creation of new “crimes” and a bipartisan presidential commission to purge the Code and the body of regulations of old “crimes.” We call for mens rea elements in the definition of any new crimes to protect Americans who, in violating a law, act unknowingly or without criminal intent. We urge Congress to codify the Common Law's Rule of Lenity, which requires courts to interpret unclear statutes in favor of a defendant. The over-federalization of criminal justice is one of many ways in which the government in Washington has intruded beyond its proper jurisdiction. The essential role of federal law enforcement personnel in protecting federal property and combating interstate crime should not be compromised by diversion to matters properly handled by state and local authorities. We applaud the Republican Governors and legislators who have been implementing criminal justice reforms like those proposed by our 2012 platform. Along with diversion of first-time, nonviolent offenders to community sentencing, accountability courts, drug courts, veterans treatment courts, and guidance by faith- based institutions with proven track records of rehabilitation, our platform emphasized restorative justice to make the victim whole and put the offender on the right path. As variants of these reforms are undertaken in many states, we urge the Congress to learn from what works. In the past, judicial discretion about sentences led to serious mistakes concerning dangerous criminals. Mandatory minimum sentencing became an important tool for keeping them off the streets. Modifications to it should be targeted toward particular categories, especially nonviolent offenders and persons with drug, alcohol, or mental health issues, and should require disclosure by the courts of any judicial departure from the state’s sentencing requirements. The constitutionality of the death penalty is firmly settled by its explicit mention in the Fifth Amendment. With the murder rate soaring in our great cities, we condemn the Supreme Court’s erosion of the right of the people to enact capital punishment in their states. In solidarity with those who protect us, we call for mandatory prison time for all assaults involving serious injury to law enforcement officers. We call on the Congress to make the federal courts a model for the rest of the country in protecting the rights of victims and their families. They should be told all relevant information about their case, allowed to be present for its trial, assured a voice in sentencing and parole hearings, given access to social and legal services, and benefit from the Crime Victims Fund established under President Reagan for that sole purpose. Public officials must regain control of their correctional institutions, some of which have become ethnic and racial battlegrounds. Persons jailed for whatever cause should be protected against cruel or degrading treatment by other inmates. Courts should not tie the hands of prison officials in dealing with these problems. We encourage states to offer opportunities for literacy and vocational education to prepare prisoners for release to the community. Breaking the cycle of crime begins with the children of those who are prisoners. Deprived of a parent through no fault of their own, youngsters from these families should be a special concern of our schools, social services, and religious institutions. The internet must not become a safe haven for predators. Pornography, with its harmful effects, especially on children, has become a public health crisis that is destroying the lives of millions. We encourage states to continue to fight this public menace and pledge our commitment to children’s safety and well-being. We applaud the social networking sites that bar sex offenders from participation. We urge energetic prosecution of child pornography, which is closely linked to human trafficking. Combatting Drug Abuse The progress made over the last three decades against drug abuse is eroding, whether for cultural reasons or for lack of national leadership. In many jurisdictions, marijuana is virtually legalized despite its illegality under federal law. At the other end of the drug spectrum, heroin use nearly doubled from 2003 to 2013, while deaths from heroin have quadrupled. All this highlights the continuing conflicts and contradictions in public attitudes and public policy toward illegal substances. Congress and a new administration should consider the long- range implications of these trends for public health and safety and prepare to deal with the problematic consequences. The misuse of prescription painkillers - opioids — is a related problem. Heroin and opioid abuse touches our communities, our homes, and our families in ways that have grave effects on Americans in every community. With a quadrupling of both their sales and their overdose deaths, the opioid crisis is ravaging communities all over the country, often hitting rural areas harder than urban. Because over-prescription of drugs is such a large part of the problem, Republican legislation now allows Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage plans to limit patients to a single pharmacy. Congressional Republicans have also called upon the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to ensure that no physician will be penalized for limiting opioid prescriptions. We look for expeditious agreement between the House and Senate on the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which addresses the opioid epidemic from both the demand and supply sides of the problem. America Resurgent A Dangerous World Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist 23 that the first of the “principal” constitutional obligations of the federal government is to provide for the “common defense” of the United States, and President George Washington wisely reminded us that “To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.” After nearly eight years of a Democratic Commander-in-Chief who has frequently placed strategic and ideological limitations and shackles on our military, our enemies have been emboldened and our national security is at great risk. Our country faces a national security crisis, and only by electing a Republican to the White House will we restore law and order to our land and safety to our citizens. We are the party of peace through strength. We believe that American exceptionalism — the notion that our ideas and principles as a nation give us a unique place of moral leadership in the world — requires the United States to retake its natural position as leader of the free world. Tyranny and injustice thrive when America is weakened. The oppressed have no greater ally than a confident and determined United States, backed by the strongest military on the planet. Quite simply, the Republican Party is committed to rebuilding the U.S. military into the strongest on earth, with vast superiority over any other nation or group of nations in the world. We face a dangerous world, and we believe in a resurgent America. In all of our country's history, there is no parallel to what President Obama and his former Secretary of State have done to weaken our nation. Our aging naval capabilities are inadequate for their job. The Air Force fields the smallest and oldest force of combat aircraft in its history. The Marines have only two-thirds the number of battalions they have historically needed to meet day to day operational demands. The Army is at its lowest troop levels since before World War II. Our U.S. Ambassador and American personnel were left without adequate security or backup halfway across the world in Benghazi. In summary, we have returned to the hollow force days of Jimmy Carter. Also neglected are our strategic forces, especially the development and deployment of ballistic missile defenses. The Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system has been delayed and underfunded. To curry favor with Russia, defense installations in Poland and the Czech Republic have been neutralized and the number of planned interceptors in Alaska has been reduced. A New START agreement (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), so weak in verification and definitions that it is virtually impossible to prove a violation, has allowed Russia to build up its nuclear arsenal while reducing ours. Meanwhile Moscow has repeatedly violated the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty (a treaty agreeing to the elimination of land-based mid-range nuclear missiles) with impunity, covertly testing missiles banned under that agreement. In the international arena, a weak Administration has invited aggression. The results of the Administration's unilateral approach to disarmament are already clear: An emboldened China in the South China Sea, a resurgent Russia occupying parts of Ukraine and threatening neighbors from the Baltic to the Caucasus, and an aggressive Islamist terror network in the Middle East. We support maintaining and, if warranted, increasing sanctions, together with our allies, against Russia unless and until Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are fully restored. We also support providing appropriate assistance to the armed forces of Ukraine and greater coordination with NATO defense planning. All our adversaries heard the message in the Administration’s cutbacks: America is weaker and retreating. Concomitantly, we honor, support, and thank all law enforcement, first responders, and emergency personnel for their service. Confronting the Dangers In the face of these threats, the first order of business for a Republican president and Congress will be to restore our nation’s military might. Republicans continue to support American military superiority which has been the cornerstone of a strategy that seeks to deter aggression or defeat those who threaten our vital national security interests. We must rebuild troop numbers and readiness and confirm their mission: Protecting the nation, not nation building. The United States should meet the Reagan model of “peace through strength” by a force that is capable of meeting any and all threats to our vital national security. We will no longer tolerate a President whose rules of engagement put our own troops in harm’s way or commanders who tell their soldiers that their first duty is to fight climate change. A Republican administration will begin at once to undo the damage of the last eight years. We must move from a budget-based strategy to one that puts the security of our nation first. This means that our Republican president’s strategic vision will include the development of a balanced force to meet the diverse threats facing our nation. Special Operations Forces are simply not intended to deal with the full spectrum of threats. We need a Reagan-era force that can fight and win two-and one-half wars ranging from counterterrorism to deterring major power aggressors. We should abandon arms control treaties that benefit our adversaries without improving our national security. We must fund, develop, and deploy a multi-layered missile defense system. We must modernize nuclear weapons and their delivery platforms, end the policy of Mutually Assured Destruction, and rebuild relationships with our allies, who understand that as long as the U.S. nuclear arsenal is their shield, they do not need to engage in nuclear proliferation. While immigration is addressed in more detail elsewhere, we cannot ignore the reality that border security is a national security issue, and that our nation’s immigration and refugee policies are placing Americans at risk. To keep our people safe, we must secure our borders, enforce our immigration laws, and properly screen refugees and other immigrants entering from any country. In particular we must apply special scrutiny to those foreign nationals seeking to enter the United States from terror-sponsoring countries or from regions associated with Islamic terrorism. This was done successfully after September 11, 2001, under the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, which should be renewed now. Supporting Our Troops: Resources to do Their Job We owe it to the American people and to those who fight our wars that we remain the strongest military on earth and be prepared to defeat any adversary under any circumstances on any battlefield, including land, air, sea, or cyber. Successive years of cuts to our defense budget have put an undue strain on our men and women in uniform. This is especially harmful at a time when we are asking our military to do more in an increasingly dangerous world. The U.S. defense budget has suffered a 25 percent cut in real dollars in the five years since sequestration. We support lifting the budget cap for defense and reject the efforts of Democrats to hold the military’s budget hostage for their domestic agenda. Congress and the Administration should work together to approve military spending at the level necessary to defend our country. We must not be encumbered by decades- old, legacy procurement processes. America’s incredible talent and ingenuity must be unleashed by modernizing the military procurement system and embracing competition among traditional and non-traditional suppliers. Competitive acquisition and maintenance of weapon systems, including the sustainment and support of such systems, will benefit the U.S. economy, U.S. taxpayers, and most important, the American warfighter. Increased competition will enable new Department of Defense suppliers, particularly small businesses, to participate in the defense sector. That will promote new demand for skilled-labor jobs, while making the Department's procurement more cost-efficient. The increased agility and effectiveness will ensure that our troops are equipped with the right resources more quickly than our current procurement systems allow. Supporting Our Troops: Standing by Our Heroes With Republican leadership, the Congress recently passed legislation that begins to reverse America's military decline. The National Defense Authorization Act of 2016 begins to correct the shortfalls in our military readiness by reversing troop cuts, increasing investments in training and maintenance, and rebuilding facilities. It gives our troops the full pay raise to which they are entitled under the law and gives the next administration the ability to review operations and funding, make adjustments, and ask for more money if necessary. All this represents a sound start in supporting those who put their lives on the line in defense of our country, while protecting our national security in a dangerous world. Military families must be assured of the pay, healthcare, housing, education, and overall support they have earned. In recent years, they have been carrying the burden of budgetary restraint more than any other Americans through cuts in their pay, health benefits, and retirement plans. About 75 percent of enlistees come from military families. We cannot expect that level of patriotic commitment to continue among young people who have experienced the way their families have been treated. We must ensure that the nation keeps its commitments to those who signed on the dotted line of enlistment. The repeated troop deployments during conflicts in the Middle East have been unusually hard on all members of their households, worsening unemployment and underemployment among spouses. In many cases, they and their children have been at war for 14 years. We must strengthen existing programs that offer families readjustment information and counseling, and we urge states to help by providing job programs, license reciprocity, one-stop service centers, and education. The burden of our country's extended military involvement in the Middle East has taken a toll on our service personnel. Suicides among our military — active duty troops, reservists, National Guardsmen, and veterans — are at shocking levels, while postservice medical conditions, including addiction and mental illness, require more and more assistance. More than ever, our government must work with the private sector to advance opportunities and provide assistance to those wounded in spirit as well as in body, whether through experimental efforts like the PAWS (Puppies Assisting Wounded Servicemen) program for service dogs or through the faith-based institutions that have traditionally been providers of counseling and aid. We support the rights of conscience of military chaplains of all faiths to practice their faith free from political interference. We reject attempts by the Obama Administration to censure and silence them, particularly Christians and Christian chaplains. We support an increase in the size of the Chaplain Corps. A Republican commander-in- chief will protect the religious freedom of all military members, especially chaplains, and will not tolerate attempts to ban Bibles or religious symbols from military facilities. A Republican commander-in- chief will also encourage education regarding the religious liberties of military personnel under both the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the current National Defense Authorization Act. Our country's all-volunteer force has been a success. We oppose the reinstatement of the draft, except in dire circumstances like world war, whether directly or through compulsory national service. We support the all-volunteer force and oppose unnecessary policy changes, including compulsory national service and Selective Service registration of women for a possible future draft. We reiterate our support for both the advancement of women in the military and their exemption from direct ground combat units and infantry battalions. We affirm the cultural values that encourage selfless service and superiority in battle, and we oppose anything which might divide or weaken team cohesion, including intra-military special interest demonstrations. In particular, we warn against modification or lessening of standards in order to satisfy a nonmilitary agenda imposed by the White House. We call for an objective review of the impact on readiness of the current Administration’s ideology- based personnel policies, and will correct problems with appropriate administrative, legal, or legislative action. We reject the use of the military as a platform for social experimentation and will not accept or continue attempts to undermine military priorities and mission readiness. We believe that our nation is most secure when the president and the administration prioritize readiness, recruitment, and retention rather than using the military to advance a social or political agenda. Military readiness should not be sacrificed on the altar of political correctness. We oppose legislative attempts to modify the system of military justice that would undermine its fairness and due process rights for all concerned, both the accuser and the accused. Citizen Soldiers: National Guard and Reserves Our Reserve and National Guard forces are national assets that must be nurtured in a manner commensurate with their role as America’s sentinels. Their historic mission as citizen-soldiers is a proud tradition linking every town and city across America to liberty’s cause. Since September 11, 2001, the National Guard has transformed from a strategic reserve to a fully integrated operational fighting force. The Guard has bled on missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Balkans, and the Sinai. Today, more than fifty percent of our Guardsmen have combat experience. The Guard has demonstrated its value to the nation not only in war but during emergencies here at home such as Hurricane Katrina and Super Storm Sandy. To avoid the overextension of our military, we support a larger active force and oppose the current Administration’s cuts to the National Guard and Reserves. Those reductions are dangerous and counter-productive because the men and women of the Guard and Reserve tend to be older and more experienced than their active duty counterparts. Guard and Reserve forces are currently deployed at historically high rates. The Army Reserve alone has soldiers in 30 countries. To its credit, the Republican Congress, by passing the National Defense Authorization Act, has moved to ensure these troops have what they need. That provision has triggered another veto threat from the Commander- in-Chief, even though the bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. He would have the members of the Reserve and Guard train on, and potentially be deployed with, equipment that is no longer used by their active duty comrades. We cannot tolerate this endangerment of both our troops and our national security. Therefore, we recommend a permanent line item for National Guard affairs, one that is not eliminated by the President and reinstated by Congress. The guard is too essential to our national defense to be a secondary decision. Honoring and Supporting Our Veterans: A Sacred Obligation Our nation’s veterans have been our nation’s strength and remain a national resource. Their service to their country — as community leaders, volunteers, mentors, educators, problem solvers, and public officials — continues long after they leave the military. In the same way, our obligation to the one percent who defend the other ninety- nine percent does not end when they take off the uniform. America has a sacred trust with our veterans, and we are committed to ensuring them and their families' care and dignity. The work of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is essential to meet our commitments to them: Providing health, education, disability, survivor, and home loan benefits, and arranging memorial services upon death. We heed Abraham Lincoln's command “to care for him who bore the battle.” To care, as well, for the families of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, who must be assured of meaningful financial assistance, remains our solemn duty. As shown by recent controversies at the Department, senior leaders must be held accountable for ensuring that their subordinates are more responsive to veterans' needs. The VA has failed those who have sacrificed the most for our freedom. The VA must move from a sometimes adversarial stance to an advocacy relationship with vets. To that end, we will empower the Secretary to hold all VA employees accountable and will seek fundamental change in the VA's senior leadership structure by placing presidential appointees, rather than careerists, in additional positions of significant responsibility. We cannot allow an unresponsive bureaucracy to blunt our national commitment. The VA must strengthen and improve its efforts through partnerships with private enterprises, veteran service organizations, technology and innovation, and competitive bidding to enable the VA to better provide both quality and timely care along with all earned benefits to our nation's veterans and their families. This will allow the VA to reduce the backlog and save immense resources all at the same time. Therefore, let us look to innovative solutions that allow higher quality VA care, reduce backlogs, and save immense resources all at the same time. Our wounded warriors, whether still in service or discharged, deserve the best medical care the country can provide. We must make military and veterans' medicine the gold standard for mental health, traumatic brain injury, multiple traumas, loss of limbs, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Those injuries require a new commitment of targeted resources and personnel for treatment and care to advance recovery. That includes allowing veterans to choose to access care in the community and not just in VA facilities, because the best care in the world is not effective if it is not accessible. We will seek to consolidate the VA's existing community care authorities to make a single program that will be easily understood by both veterans and VA healthcare providers. Like the rest of American medicine, the VA faces a critical shortage of primary care and mental health physicians. That's why there are long waiting times to see a doctor and why doctors are often frustrated by the limited time they have with their patients. This is especially the case with mental health care, which often amounts to prescribing drugs because there are not enough psychologists and psychiatrists to do anything else. Inadequate treatment of PTSD drives other problems like suicide, homelessness, and unemployment. This situation may not be quickly reversed, but a Republican administration will begin, on day one, to undertake the job. As a nation, we honor the sacrifice of our fallen service members at the graves where we lay them to rest in national, state, and veterans' cemeteries around the world. In doing so, we make it clear that their ultimate sacrifice and service to our country will never be forgotten. As a party, we seek to honor their sacrifice and comfort their families by ensuring all veterans' cemeteries are adequately equipped and a standard of care established, using Arlington Cemetery as a guide, that is befitting their service. The level of financial distress and homelessness among vets is a shame to the nation. For a veteran, a job is more than a source of income. It is a new mission, with a new status, and the transition can be difficult. We urge the private sector to make hiring vets a company policy and commend the organizations that have proven programs to accomplish this. We will retain the preference given to veterans when they seek federal employment. We urge closer coordination with the state offices for veterans' affairs, particularly with regard to expediting disability claims, since those closest to an individual can often best diagnose a problem and apply a remedy. We will halt the current Administration's unconstitutional automatic denial of gun ownership to returning members of our Armed Forces who have had representatives appointed to manage their financial affairs. We urge state education officials to promote the hiring of qualified veterans as teachers in our public schools. Their proven abilities and life experiences will make them more successful instructors and role models for students than would any teaching certification. Over-prescription of opioids has become a nationwide problem hindering the treatment of veterans suffering from mental health issues. We therefore support the need to explore new and broader ranges of options, including faith- based programs, that will better serve the veteran and reduce the need to rely on drugs as the sole treatment. America: The Indispensable Nation For the last several generations, our country’s two major political parties were dedicated to the nation’s security and the advance of freedom around the world. Both had learned from mistakes of the past and realized that a weak America invited aggression. Both recognized the need to stand with friends and oppose those who wished us evil. Whatever their disagreements, both the Republican and Democratic parties stood for peace through strength — and strength meant American military superiority. This bipartisan commitment has tragically changed. The leadership of the Democratic Party, both those in office and those who seek it, no longer see America as a force for good in the world. They do not stand by allies or stand strong against our foes. They pander to world opinion and neglect the national interest. They cannot be trusted to advance either the cause of liberty or our national security in the dangerous years in which we live. We affirm our party’s tradition of world leadership established by President Eisenhower and followed by every Republican president since. It stands for enormous power — and the prudence to use it sparingly, precisely, and only in grave necessity. It stands for involvement, not intervention. It requires consultation, not permission to act. It leads from the front — and ensures all others do their parts as well. It embraces American exceptionalism and rejects the false prophets of decline and diminution. It is, in sum, the way we will lead the world into a new century of greater peace and prosperity — another American Century. Challenges of a Changing Middle East The Middle East is more dangerous now than at any time since the Second World War. Whatever their disagreements, presidents of both parties had always prioritized America’s national interests, the trust of friendly governments, and the security of Israel. That sound consensus was replaced with impotent grandstanding on the part of the current President and his Secretaries of State. The results have been ruinous for all parties except Islamic terrorists and their Iranian and other sponsors. We consider the Administration’s deal with Iran, to lift international sanctions and make hundreds of billions of dollars available to the Mullahs, a personal agreement between the President and his negotiating partners and non-binding on the next president. Without a two-thirds endorsement by the Senate, it does not have treaty status. Because of it, the defiant and emboldened regime in Tehran continues to sponsor terrorism across the region, develop a nuclear weapon, test-fire ballistic missiles inscribed with “Death to Israel,” and abuse the basic human rights of its citizens. A Republican president will not be bound by it. We must retain all options in dealing with a situation that gravely threatens our security, our interests, and the survival of our friends. Over the last four years we have seen the rise of a murderous fanaticism in the form of ISIS, the so called Islamic State. Its reach now extends far beyond the Middle East to virtually every continent. ISIS has brought ancient butchery into the 21st century. Nations are imploding, erasing long- established borders. The Obama Administration and its Secretary of State so mishandled the Arab Spring that it destabilized the entire region. The hope some saw in the Arab Spring has transformed into disappointment. The dictator of Syria, Bashar Assad, has murdered hundreds of thousands of his own people and created millions of refugees, and an American president has been unable to rally the world against him. Understandably, our allies fear for their future in a region far more dangerous than it was eight years ago. A Republican administration will restore our nation’s credibility. We must stand up for our friends, challenge our foes, and destroy ISIS. Hezbollah, controlling over 100,000 missiles in Lebanon, must be isolated and Lebanon’s independence restored. We will support the transition to a post-Assad Syrian government that is representative of its people, protects the rights of all minorities and religions, respects the territorial integrity of its neighbors, and contributes to peace and stability in the region. The Iraqi people have been on the front lines in the fight against terror. Hundreds of thousands have been killed, and the attacks against them continue, even in Baghdad. Our partnership with them should continue as long as ISIS and others like it survive in the region. We are deeply concerned that, in the face of genocide against them, Christian communities in cities like Erbil are receiving no financial support from either the U.S. government or the UN to help with displaced persons and urban refugees. Their survival is sustained only by private charities. This must change immediately. Defeating ISIS means more than pushing back its fighters while abandoning its victims. It must mean aiding those who have suffered the most — and doing so before they starve. It means supporting the long-term survival of indigenous religious and ethnic communities, punishing the perpetrators of crimes against humanity, and conditioning humanitarian and military assistance to governments on their observable commitment to human rights. We continue to support the Kurdish people, whose bravery and cooperation with our forces merit our respect and their autonomy. Many countries in the region have given, and continue to give, substantial assistance to the United States because they understand that our struggle against terrorism is not an ethnic or religious fight. They consider violent extremists to be abusers of their faith, not its champions. We applaud their courage and value their counsel. The U.S. government, together with its global partners, should mobilize its political, economic, and military assets to support the creation of a safe haven in northern Iraq to protect those ethnic and religious minorities continuing to face genocide at the hands of ISIS. Our Unequivocal Support for Israel Like the United States of America, the modern state of Israel is a country born from the aspiration for freedom and stands out among the nations as a beacon of democracy and humanity. Beyond our mutual strategic interests, Israel is likewise an exceptional country that shares our most essential values. It is the only country in the Middle East where freedom of speech and freedom of religion are found. Therefore, support for Israel is an expression of Americanism, and it is the responsibility of our government to advance policies that reflect Americans' strong desire for a relationship with no daylight between America and Israel. We recognize Jerusalem as the eternal and indivisible capital of the Jewish state and call for the American embassy to be moved there in fulfillment of U.S. law. We reaffirm America's commitment to Israel's security and will ensure that Israel maintains a qualitative military edge over any and all adversaries. We support Israel's right and obligation to defend itself against terror attacks upon its people and against alternative forms of warfare being waged upon it legally, economically, culturally, and otherwise. We reject the false notion that Israel is an occupier and specifically recognize that the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement (BDS) is anti-Semitic in nature and seeks to destroy Israel. Therefore, we call for effective legislation to thwart actions that are intended to limit commercial relations with Israel, or persons or entities doing business in Israel or in Israeli-controlled territories, in a discriminatory manner. The United States seeks to assist in the establishment of comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East, to be negotiated among those living in the region. We oppose any measures intended to impose an agreement or to dictate borders or other terms, and we call for the immediate termination of all U.S. funding of any entity that attempts to do so. Our party is proud to stand with Israel now and always. U.S. Leadership in the Asian Pacific We are a Pacific nation with economic, military, and cultural ties to all the countries of the oceanic rim and treaty alliances with Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines, and Thailand. With them, we look toward the establishment of human rights for the people of North Korea. We urge the government of China to recognize the inevitability of change in the Kim family’s slave state and, for everyone’s safety against nuclear disaster, to hasten positive change on the Korean peninsula. The United States will continue to demand the complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program with full accounting of its proliferation activities. We also pledge to counter any threats from the North Korean regime. We salute the people of Taiwan, with whom we share the values of democracy, human rights, a free market economy, and the rule of law. Our relations will continue to be based upon the provisions of the Taiwan Relations Act, and we affirm the Six Assurances given to Taiwan in 1982 by President Reagan. We oppose any unilateral steps by either side to alter the status quo in the Taiwan Straits on the principle that all issues regarding the island’s future must be resolved peacefully, through dialogue, and be agreeable to the people of Taiwan. If China were to violate those principles, the United States, in accord with the Taiwan Relations Act, will help Taiwan defend itself. We praise efforts by the new government in Taipei to continue constructive relations across the Taiwan Strait and call on China to reciprocate. As a loyal friend of America, Taiwan has merited our strong support, including free trade agreement status, the timely sale of defensive arms including technology to build diesel submarines, and full participation in the World Health Organization, International Civil Aviation Organization, and other multilateral institutions. China’s behavior has negated the optimistic language of our last platform concerning our future relations with China. The liberalizing policies of recent decades have been abruptly reversed, dissent brutally crushed, religious persecution heightened, the internet crippled, a barbaric population control two-child policy of forced abortions and forced sterilizations continued, and the cult of Mao revived. Critics of the regime have been kidnapped by its agents in foreign countries. To distract the populace from its increasing economic problems and, more importantly, to expand its military might, the government asserts a preposterous claim to the entire South China Sea and continues to dredge ports and create landing fields in contested waters where none have existed before, ever nearer to U.S. territories and our allies, while building a navy far out of proportion to defensive purposes. The complacency of the Obama regime has emboldened the Chinese government and military to issue threats of intimidation throughout the South China Sea, not to mention parading their new missile, ""the Guam Killer,” down the main streets of Beijing, a direct shot at Guam as America’s first line of defense. Meanwhile, cultural genocide continues in Tibet and Xinjiang, the promised autonomy of Hong Kong is eroded, the currency is manipulated, our technology is stolen, and intellectual property and copyrights are mocked in an economy based on piracy. In business terms, this is not competition; it is a hostile takeover. For any American company to abet those offenses, especially governmental censorship and tracking of dissenters, is a disgrace. The return to Maoism by China’s current rulers is not reason to disengage with the Chinese people or their institutions. We welcome students, tourists, and investors, who can see for themselves our vibrant American democracy and how real democracy works. We caution, however, against academic or cultural operations under the control of the Chinese government and call upon American colleges to dissociate themselves from this increasing threat to academic freedom and honest research. Most of the nations of Southeast Asia have set aside crippling ideologies and sought material progress in free enterprise and democracy. We congratulate the people of Burma on their emergence from authoritarian rule and urge their respect for the rights of their country’s minority populations. Our improved relations with Vietnam — including arms sales — must advance efforts to obtain an accounting for, and repatriation of the remains of, Americans who gave their lives in the cause of Vietnamese freedom. We cannot overlook the continued repression of fundamental rights and religious freedom, as well as retribution against ethnic minorities and others who assisted U.S. forces during the conflict there. India is our geopolitical ally and a strategic trading partner. The dynamism of its people and the endurance of their democratic institutions are earning their country a position of leadership not only in Asia but throughout the world. We encourage the Indian government to permit expanded foreign investment and trade, the key to rising living standards for those left out of their country's energetic economy. For all of India's religious communities, we urge protection against violence and discrimination. Republicans note with pride the contributions to our country that are made by our fellow citizens of Indian ancestry. Conflicts in the Middle East have created special political and military challenges for the people of Pakistan. Our working relationship is a necessary, though sometimes difficult, benefit to both, and we look toward the strengthening of historic ties that have frayed under the weight of international conflict. This process cannot progress as long as any citizen of Pakistan can be punished for helping the War on Terror. Pakistanis, Afghans, and Americans have a common interest in ridding the region of the Taliban and securing Pakistan's nuclear arsenal. That goal has been undermined by the current Administration's feckless treatment of troop commitments and blatant disregard of advice from commanders on the ground, particularly with regard to Afghanistan. A Republican president will work with all regional leaders to restore mutual trust while insisting upon progress against corruption and the narcotic trade that fuels insurgency. Renewing the European Alliance With bipartisan support, President Truman forged the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as an alliance of the western democracies. Its continued effectiveness is vital, especially in light of recent military challenges in Eastern Europe. With the American people spending on defense, per capita, four times the amount spent by Europeans, we demand, as we have in the past, that our fellow members of NATO fulfill their commitments and meet their need for greater investment in their armed forces. Our historic ties to the peoples of Europe have been based on shared culture and values, common interests and goals. Their endurance cannot be taken for granted, especially in light of the continent's economic problems and demographic changes. We recognize with regret the increasing trend among many of our allies to move away from rights and liberties that Americans hold dear, especially freedom of speech. It would be a tragic irony if the nations of Europe which withstood Soviet repression were to now impose a form of it upon themselves. We honor our special relationship with the people of the United Kingdom and are grateful for their staunch support in the fight against terrorism. We respect their decision concerning their nation's relationship to the European Union and pledge that, however much other international relationships may change, those who were first to our side in our hour of loss will always rank first in our policies and our esteem. We thank the several nations of Europe that have contributed to a united effort in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. Their support and sacrifice in the fight against Islamic terrorism will not be forgotten. We applaud the ongoing reconciliation in Northern Ireland and hope that its success might be replicated in Cyprus. We urge greater coordination in economic and security affairs between the United States and the republics of Eastern Europe. We urge that Poland be granted visa waiver status and we support placement of NATO troops in Poland. For the people of Russia, we affirm our respect and our determination to maintain a friendship beyond the reach of those who wish to divide us. We have common imperatives: Ending terrorism, combating nuclear proliferation, promoting trade, and more. We also have a common problem: The continuing erosion of personal liberty and fundamental rights under the current officials in the Kremlin. Repressive at home and reckless abroad, their policies imperil the nations which regained their self-determination upon the collapse of the Soviet Union. We will meet the return of Russian belligerence with the same resolve that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. We will not accept any territorial change in Eastern Europe imposed by force, in Ukraine, Georgia, or elsewhere, and will use all appropriate constitutional measures to bring to justice the practitioners of aggression and assassination. We urge greater attention in U.S. diplomacy, trade, and strategic planning, to the nations of Eurasia, formerly parts of the Soviet Empire. Caught between their two authoritarian neighbors, their path toward democratic institutions has been uncertain. We urge our government and our allies to work toward the integration of the Central Asian republics into the global economy through foreign investment, which can bring with it market and political reforms and a firmer establishment of the rule of law. Those developments will not only improve the living conditions throughout that vast area but are likely to reduce the lure of the radical ideologies that already threaten the region. Family of the Americas Our future is intimately tied to the future of the Americas. Family, language, culture, environment, and trade link us closely with both Canada and Mexico. Our relations with both of these friends will be based upon continuing cooperation and our mutually shared interests. Our attention to trade and environmental issues will contribute to strong economic growth and prosperity throughout the Americas. We thank our neighbors in Mexico and Canada who have been our partners in the fight against terrorism and the war on drugs. The Mexican people deserve our assistance as they bravely resist the drug cartels that traffic in death on both sides of our border. Their rich cultural and religious heritage, shared by many millions of our fellow citizens, should foster greater understanding and cooperation between our countries. Our Canadian neighbors can count on our cooperation and respect. To advance North America's energy independence, we intend to reverse the current Administration's blocking of the Keystone XL Pipeline. Apart from its economic value, that project has become a symbol in the contest between the public's desire for economic development and the government's hostility to growth. We stand with the people. We express our solidarity with all the peoples of the Western Hemisphere. Their aspirations for economic betterment and political liberty have deserved better from our government than its policies of the last eight years. The current Administration has abandoned America's friends and rewarded its enemies. A Republican president will never embrace a Marxist dictator, in Venezuela or anywhere else. The current chief executive has allowed that country to become a narcoterrorist state, an Iranian outpost threatening Central America, and a safe haven for the agents of Hezbollah. Now, with their country ruined by socialism and on the verge of chaos, the Venezuelan people are fighting to restore their democracy and regain their rights. When they triumph, as they surely will, the United States will stand ready to help them restore their country to the family of the Americas. We affirm our friendship and admiration for the people of Colombia and call on the Republican Congress to express its solidarity with their decades-long fight against the terrorist FARC. Their sacrifice and suffering must not be betrayed by the accession to power of murderers and drug lords. We want to welcome the people of Cuba back into our hemispheric family — after their corrupt rulers are forced from power and brought to account for their crimes against humanity. We stand with the Women in White and all the victims of the loathsome regime that clings to power in Havana. We do not say this lightly: They have been betrayed by those who are currently in control of U.S. foreign policy. The current Administration's “opening to Cuba” was a shameful accommodation to the demands of its tyrants. It will only strengthen their military dictatorship. We call on the Congress to uphold current U.S. law which sets conditions for the lifting of sanctions on the island: Legalization of political parties, an independent media, and free and fair internationally-supervised elections. We call for a dedicated platform for the transmission of Radio and TV Marti and for the promotion of internet access and circumvention technology as tools to strength Cuba's pro-democracy movement. We support the work of the Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba and affirm the principles of the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966, recognizing the rights of Cubans fleeing Communism. Africa: The Promise and the Challenge We recognize Africa’s extraordinary potential. Both the United States and our many African allies will become stronger through investment, trade, and promotion of the democratic and free market principles that have brought prosperity around the world. We pledge to be the best partner of all African nations in their pursuit of economic freedom and human rights. The Republican Congress has extended to 2025 the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and President George W. Bush’s health initiatives — AIDS relief under PEPFAR and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria — continue to save millions of lives. Peace Corps volunteers and U.S. Seabees teach and build in villages that know firsthand our country’s idealism. We stand in solidarity with those African countries now under assault by the forces of radical Islam: Boko Haram, al-Shabaab, and others like them. Their terror falls on both Muslims and Christians, on anyone who will not submit to their savage ideology. We urge governments throughout the continent to recognize this threat to their own people. We support closer cooperation in both military and economic matters with those on the front lines of civilization’s battle against the forces of evil. Sovereign American Leadership in International Organizations There is no substitute for principled American leadership. Since the end of World War II, the United States, through the founding of the United Nations and NATO, has participated in a number of international organizations which can, but sometimes do not, serve the cause of peace and prosperity. While acting through them our country must always reserve the right to go its own way. We must not be silent about our country’s cause. That is why we have long supported our country’s international broadcasting to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Our continued participation in the United Nations should be contingent upon the enactment of long-overdue changes in the way that institution functions. American taxpayers, the chief funders of the U.N., deserve full transparency in the financial operations of its overpaid bureaucrats. We should no longer tolerate its managerial scandals, its Human Rights Council composed of some of the world’s worst tyrants, and its treatment of Israel as a pariah state. The U.N.’s Population Fund has, from its origin, been rooted in no-growth policies that limit economic development in the countries needing it most. Its complicity in China’s barbaric program of forced abortion led President Reagan to set a wall of separation — his Mexico City Policy, which prohibits the granting of federal monies to non-governmental organizations that provide or promote abortion. We affirm his position and, in light of plummeting birth rates around the world, suggest a reevaluation of the U.N.’s record on economic progress. Precisely because we take our country’s treaty obligations seriously, we oppose ratification of international agreements whose long-range implications are ominous or unclear. We do not support the U.N. Convention on Women’s Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty, as well as various declarations from the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development. Because of our concern for American sovereignty, domestic management of our fisheries, and our country’s long-term energy needs, we have deep reservations about the regulatory, legal, and tax regimes inherent in the Law of the Sea Treaty. We emphatically reject U.N. Agenda 21 as erosive of U.S. sovereignty, and we oppose any form of Global Tax. To shield members of our Armed Forces and others in service to America from ideological prosecutions overseas, the Republican Party does not accept the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. We support statutory protection for U.S. personnel and officials as they act abroad to meet our global security requirements, and we deplore the current inaction of the Administration in that regard. Our service members must be subject only to American law. Defending International Religious Freedom The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, an initiative of Congressional Republicans, has been neglected by the current Administration at a time when its voice more than ever needs to be heard. Religious minorities across the Middle East have been driven from their ancient homelands, and thousands, there and in Africa, have been slaughtered for their faith in what the State Department has, belatedly, labeled genocide. The United States must stand with leaders, like President Sisi of Egypt who has bravely protected the rights of Coptic Christians in Egypt, and call on other leaders across the region to ensure that all religious minorities, whether Yazidi, Bahai, Orthodox, Catholic or Protestant Christians, are free to practice their religion without fear of persecution. At a time when China has renewed its destruction of churches, Christian home-schooling parents are jailed in parts of Europe, and even Canada threatens pastors for their preaching, a Republican administration will return the advocacy of religious liberty to a central place in its diplomacy, will quickly designate the systematic killing of religious and ethnic minorities a genocide, and will work with the leaders of other nations to condemn and combat genocidal acts. America’s Generosity: International Assistance that Makes a Difference Foreign aid must serve America’s interests first. In today’s world of complex challenges, international assistance is a critical tool for advancing America’s security and economic interests by preventing conflict, building stability, opening markets for private investment, and responding to suffering and need with the compassion that is at the heart of our country’s values. A strong commitment to international development and diplomacy, alongside defense, was a key component of President Reagan’s ""peace through strength” strategy. It can sometimes serve as an alternative means of keeping the peace, far less costly both in dollars and in human lives than military engagement. The Millennium Challenge Corporation, spearheaded by the last Republican Administration, has established a new model of foreign assistance that helps ensure taxpayer dollars are spent on projects that are effective, results-driven, transparent, and accountable. We must embrace this model throughout our foreign assistance programs and efforts as a catalyst for private sector investment to combat corruption, strengthen the rule of law, and open new markets for American goods and services in a competitive global economy. Foreign assistance programs must not only project the best of American values, but must work to create self-sustainability and leverage the resources and capacity of the private sector. Even more important is the overseas assistance — billions of dollars and volunteer hours — provided by America’s foundations, educational institutions, faith-based groups, and charitable individuals. Their essential role in international development should be weighed in any revision of the tax code. The advance of political freedom and entrepreneurial capitalism drives economic growth, catalyzes private sector development, and is the only sustainable solution to poverty. Over the last 50 years, the level of private investment overseas from the United States has eclipsed aid many times over. Our development strategy must build on recent Republican efforts to use foreign assistance to catalyze private sector investment and expertise in addressing global challenges that can build a more stable world and advance America’s national security and economic interests. The integrity of our country’s foreign assistance program has been compromised by the current Administration’s attempt to impose on foreign recipients, especially the peoples of Africa, its own radical social agenda while excluding faith-based groups — the sector with the best track record in promoting development — because they will not conform to that agenda. We pledge to reverse this course, encouraging more involvement by the most effective aid organizations and trusting developing peoples to build their futures through their own values. Advancing Human Rights To those who stand in the darkness of tyranny, America has always been a beacon of hope, and so it must remain. Radical Islamic terrorism poses an existential threat to personal freedom and peace around the world. We oppose its brutal assault on all human beings, all of whom have inherent dignity. The Republican Party stands united with all victims of terrorism and will fight at home and abroad to destroy terrorist organizations and protect the lives and fundamental liberties of all people. Republicans have led the way in promoting initiatives that have protected and rescued millions of the world’s most vulnerable and persecuted. Standing up for repressed religious groups, prisoners of conscience, women trafficked into sexual slavery, and those suffering from disease or starvation is not just consistent with American values. It advances important security and economic interests as well. A Republican administration will never say, as Hillary Clinton did as Secretary of State in 2009, that raising human rights concerns “can't interfere with the global economic crisis, the global climate change crisis, and the security crisis.” The United States needs a radical rethinking of our human rights diplomacy. A Republican administration will adopt a “whole of government” approach to protect fundamental freedoms globally, one where pressing human rights and rule of law issues are integrated at every appropriate level of our bilateral relationships and strategic decisionmaking. Republican policy will reflect the fact that the health of the U.S. economy and environment, the safety of our food and drug supplies, the security of our investments and personal information in cyberspace, and the stability and security of the oceans will increasingly depend on allowing the free flow of news and information and developing an independent judiciary and civil society in countries with repressive governments such as China, Russia, and many nations in the Middle East and Africa. Liberty to Captives: Combatting Human Trafficking As an estimated 21 million people worldwide are trapped in modern day slavery, we are reminded to be vigilant against human trafficking in whatever form it appears. We will use the full force of the law against those who engage in commercial sexual exploitation and forced or bonded labor of men, women, or children; involuntary domestic servitude; trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal; and the illegal recruitment and use of child soldiers. Building on the accomplishments of the last Republican administration in implementing the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, we call for increased diplomatic efforts and accountability for foreign governments to prosecute traffickers, including penalties for any public officials who may be complicit in this devastating crime. We will highlight the need to stop slave labor, taking steps to prevent overseas labor contractors who exploit foreign workers from supporting military bases abroad or exporting goods to the United States. A Republican administration will strategize with partners around the world to prevent the demand for trafficking victims that makes exploitation lucrative and will prosecute sex tourists and domestic buyers to the fullest extent of the law. We will work at home and abroad to ensure that trafficking victims are identified among migrants, refugees, and our own citizens so they receive the rehabilitative care needed to heal and thrive. America's continuing participation in the international campaign against human trafficking merits our support. The goal of our domestic antitrafficking programs should be the rescue and safe return of victims to their homes, not creating a longterm dependency upon public support. We call for greater scrutiny of overseas labor contractors to prevent abuses against temporary foreign workers brought to the United States. The horrific deaths of smuggled workers on our southwestern border at the hands of drug cartels and other gangs highlight the need for total security in that region. Facing 21st Century Threats: Cybersecurity in an Insecure World Cyber attacks against our businesses, institutions, and the government itself have become almost routine. They will continue until the world understands that an attack will not be tolerated — that we are prepared to respond in kind and in greater magnitude. Despite their promises to the contrary, Russia and China see cyber operations as a part of a warfare strategy during peacetime. Our response should be to cause diplomatic, financial, and legal pain, curtailing visas for guilty parties, freezing their assets, and pursuing criminal actions against them. We should seek to weaken control over the internet by regimes that engage in cyber crimes. We must stop playing defense and go on offense to avoid the cyber-equivalent of Pearl Harbor. The Republican Congress has passed important legislation to advance information-sharing among entities endangered by cyber attacks. We will explore the possibility of a free market for Cyber-Insurance and make clear that users have a selfdefense right to deal with hackers as they see fit. It is critical that we protect the cyber supply chain to ensure against contamination of components made all over the world, sometimes in offending countries. Our own cyber workforce should be expanded with the assistance of the military, business, and hacker communities to better protect our country. Protection Against an Electromagnetic Pulse A single nuclear weapon detonated at high altitude over this country would collapse our electrical grid and other critical infrastructures and endanger the lives of millions. With North Korea in possession of nuclear missiles and Iran close to having them, an EMP is no longer a theoretical concern — it is a real threat. Moreover, China and Russia include sabotage as part of their warfare planning. Nonetheless, hundreds of electrical utilities in the United States have not acted to protect themselves from EMP, and they cannot be expected to do so voluntarily since homeland security is a government responsibility. The President, the Congress, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, the States, the utilities, and the private sector should work together on an urgent basis to enact Republican legislation, pending in both chambers, to protect the national grid and encourage states to take the initiative to protect their own grids expeditiously. Confronting Internet Tyranny Internet firewall circumvention and anticensorship technology must become a national priority in light of the way authoritarian governments such as China, Cuba, and Iran restrict free press and isolate their people limiting political, cultural, and religious freedom. Leaders of authoritarian governments argue that governments have the same legal right to control internet access as they do to control migrant access. A focus on internet freedom is a cost-effective means of peacefully advancing fundamental freedoms in closed and authoritarian societies. But it is also an important economic interest, as censorship constitutes a trade barrier for U.S. companies operating in societies like China with advanced firewall protection policies. A Republican administration will champion an open and free internet based on principles of free expression and universal values and will pursue policies to empower citizens and U.S. companies operating in authoritarian countries to circumvent internet firewalls and gain accurate news and information online.",230836,35599,"preamble with this platform, we the republican party reaffirm the principles that unite us in a common purpose. we believe in american exceptionalism. we believe the united states of america is unlike any other nation on earth. we believe america is exceptional because of our historic role — first as refuge, then as defender, and now as exemplar of liberty for the world to see. we affirm — as did the declaration of independence: that all are created equal, endowed by their creator with inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. we believe in the constitution as our founding document. we believe the constitution was written not as a flexible document, but as our enduring covenant. we believe our constitutional system — limited government, separation of powers, federalism, and the rights of the people — must be preserved uncompromised for future generations. we believe political freedom and economic freedom are indivisible. when political freedom and economic freedom are separated — both are in peril; when united, they are invincible. we believe that people are the ultimate resource — and that the people, not the government, are the best stewards of our country's god-given natural resources. as americans and as republicans we wish for peace — so we insist on strength. we will make america safe. we seek friendship with all peoples and all nations, but we recognize and are prepared to deal with evil in the world. based on these principles, this platform is an invitation and a roadmap. it invites every american to join us and shows the path to a stronger, safer, and more prosperous america. this platform is optimistic because the american people are optimistic. this platform lays out — in clear language — the path to making america great and united again. for the past years america has been led in the wrong direction. our economy has become unnecessarily weak with stagnant wages. people living paycheck to paycheck are struggling, sacrificing, and suffering. americans have earned and deserve a strong and healthy economy. our standing in world affairs has declined significantly — our enemies no longer fear us and our friends no long trust us. people want and expect an america that is the most powerful and respected country on the face of the earth. the men and women of our military remain the world's best. the have been shortchanged in numbers, equipment, and benefits by a commander in chief who treats the armed forces and our veterans as a necessary inconvenience. the president and the democratic party have dismantled americans' system of healthcare. they have replaced it with a costly and complicated scheme that limits choices and takes away our freedom. the president and the democratic party have abandoned their promise of being accountable to the american people. they have nearly doubled the size of the national debt. they refuse to control our borders but try to control our schools, farms, businesses, and even our religious institutions. they have directly attacked the production of american energy and the industry-related jobs that have sustained families and communities. the president has been regulating to death a free market economy that he does not like and does not understand. he defies the laws of the united states by refusing to enforce those with which he does not agree. and he appoints judges who legislate from the bench rather than apply the law. we, as republicans and americans, cannot allow this to continue. that is why the many sections of this platform affirm our trust in the people, our faith in their judgment, and our determination to help them take back their country. this means removing the power from unelected, unaccountable government. this means relieving the burden and expense of punishing government regulations. and this means returning to the people and the states the control that belongs to them. it is the control and the power to make their own decisions about what’s best for themselves and their families and communities. this platform is many things: a handbook for returning decision-making to the people. a guide to the constitutional rights of every american. and a manual for the kind of sustained growth that will bring opportunity to all those on the sidelines of our society. every time we sing, ""god bless america,” we are asking for help. we ask for divine help that our country can fulfill its promise. we earn that help by recommitting ourselves to the ideas and ideals that are the true greatness of america restoring the american dream rebuilding the economy and creating jobs we are the party of a growing economy that gives everyone a chance in life, an opportunity to learn, work, and realize the prosperity freedom makes possible. government cannot create prosperity, though government can limit or destroy it. prosperity is the product of self-discipline, enterprise, saving and investment by individuals, but it is not an end in itself. prosperity provides the means by which citizens and their families can maintain their independence from government, raise their children by their own values, practice their faith, and build communities of cooperation and mutual respect. it is also the foundation for our nation's global leadership, for it is the vigor of our economy which makes possible our military strength and our national security. pundits and democrats tell us that we should accept the new normal of a slow-growing economy. the consequences are too dire to ever accept that: president obama and his party will set a record of being the first modern president ever to leave office without a single calendar year of three percent economic growth. as a result, the number of americans living in poverty has increased by million, our nation's economy has lost nearly $ trillion of cumulative output compared with an average recovery, and the economic growth shortfall has left a cumulative real after-tax per person personal income shortfall of nearly $, compared with an average recovery. under president obama and the democrats, new private-sector jobs are three million below where they should have been with just average modern post-recession growth. our labor force participation rate has plunged to at or below percent for far too long, lows last seen two generations ago before president reagan was elected in . business closures have exceeded business startups throughout the obama presidency. strong growth, more jobs, increasing incomes, and expanding opportunity are all in short supply under president obama and the democrats. we repudiate the absurd idea this is the best america can do. the american people rejected that nonsense the last time it was offered, in the historic election of , and we ask them to join us now to again repudiate the false gospel of america's di- minishment and retreat. we offer instead our vision of an opportunity society based on the economics of inclusion. fair and simple taxes for growth republicans consider the establishment of a pro-growth tax code a moral imperative. more than any other public policy, the way government raises revenue — how much, at what rates, under what circumstances, from whom, and for whom — has the greatest impact on our economy's performance. it powerfully influences the level of economic growth and job creation, which translates into the level of opportunity for those who would otherwise be left behind. getting our tax system right will be the most important factor in driving the entire economy back to prosperity. the current tax code is rightly the object of both anger and mockery. its length is exceeded only by its complexity. we must start anew. that will be an enormous undertaking and, if it is to succeed, it must command the attention and approval of the american people. it cannot be engineered from the top down, but must have a common sense approach, and be simplified. our proposal is straightforward. wherever tax rates penalize thrift or discourage investment, they must be lowered. wherever current provisions of the code are disincentives for economic growth, they must be changed. we will not divide the american people into winners and losers. we will eliminate as many special interest provisions and loopholes as possible and curb corporate welfare, especially where their erosion of the tax base has created pressure for higher rates. we will be mindful of the burdens on families with children and the impact on an aging population. we will seek simplicity and clarity so that every taxpayer can understand how much of their income is consumed by the federal government. we will welcome all to this enterprise — to discuss, debate, challenge, and amend — so that together we can restore economic growth for the american people and, even more important, renew their faith in the future. our tax principles to ensure that past abuses will not be repeated, we assert these fundamental principles. we oppose retroactive taxation. we condemn attempts by activist judges at any level of government to seize the power of the purse from the people's elected representatives by ordering higher taxes. we oppose tax policies that deliberately divide americans or promote class warfare. because of the vital role of religious organizations, charities, and fraternal benevolent societies in fostering generosity and patriotism, they should not be subject to taxation and donations to them should remain deductible. to guard against hypertaxation of the american people in any restructuring of the federal tax system, any value added tax or national sales tax must be tied to the simultaneous repeal of the sixteenth amendment, which established the federal income tax. a competitive america competitiveness equals jobs. that equation governs our policies regarding u.s. corporations in the global economy. private investment is a key driver of economic growth and job creation. after falling dramatically during the recession, private investment has recovered at a disappointing pace due in part to high corporate tax rates and increasing regulatory burdens and uncertainty. american businesses now face the world's highest corporate tax rates. that's like putting lead shoes on your cross-country team. it reduces companies' ability to compete overseas, encourages them to move abroad, lessens their investment, cripples job creation here at home, lowers american wages, and fosters the avoidance of tax liability — without actually increasing tax revenues. a more damaging policy is hard to imagine. we propose to level the international playing field by lowering the corporate tax rate to be on a par with, or below, the rates of other industrial nations. we endorse the recommendation of the national commission on fiscal responsibility and reform, as well as the current administration's export council, to switch to a territorial system of taxation so that profits earned and taxed abroad may be repatriated for job-creating investment here at home. we believe american companies should be headquartered in america. we should reduce barriers to accomplishing that goal. a winning trade policy international trade is crucial for all sectors of america's economy. massive trade deficits are not. we envision a worldwide multilateral agreement among nations committed to the principles of open markets, what has been called a “reagan economic zone,” in which free trade will truly be fair trade for all concerned. we need better negotiated trade agreements that put america first. when trade agreements have been carefully negotiated with friendly democracies, they have resulted in millions of new jobs here at home supported by our exports. when those agreements do not adequately protect u.s. interests, u.s. sovereignty, or when they are violated with impunity, they must be rejected. we cannot allow foreign governments to limit american access to their markets while stealing our designs, patents, brands, know-how, and technology. we cannot allow china to continue its currency manipulation, exclusion of u.s. products from government purchases, and subsidization of chinese companies to thwart american imports. the current administration's way of dealing with these violations of world trade standards has been a virtual surrender. republicans understand that you can succeed in a negotiation only if you are willing to walk away from it. a republican president will insist on parity in trade and stand ready to implement countervailing duties if other countries refuse to cooperate. at the same time, we look to broaden our trade agreements with countries which share our values and commitment to fairness, along with transparency in our commercial and business practices. in pursuing that objective, the american people demand transparency, full disclosure, protection of our national sovereignty, and tough negotiation on the part of those who are supposed to advance the interests of u.s. workers. significant trade agreements should not be rushed or undertaken in a lame duck congress. freeing financial markets the republican vision for american banking calls for establishing transparent, efficient markets where consumers can obtain loans they need at reasonable rates based on market conditions. unfortunately, in response to the financial institutions crisis of -, the democratic-controlled congress enacted the wall street reform and consumer protection act, otherwise known as dodd-frank. they did not let the crisis go to waste but used it as an excuse to establish unprecedented government control over the nation's financial markets. the consequences have been bad for everyone except federal regulators. rather than address the cause of the crisis — the government's own housing policies — the new law extended government control over the economy by creating new unaccountable bureaucracies. predictably, central planning of our financial sector has not created jobs, it has killed them. it has not limited risks, it has created more. it has not encouraged economic growth, it has shackled it. since the enactment of dodd-frank, the number of community banks has significantly declined, and the cost and complexity of complying with the law has created impediments to the remaining banks' ability to support the customers they serve. from , community banks in , only , remain. still, the majority of agricultural loans and small business loans are made by community banks. from start-ups foregone to home loans not made, dodd-frank’s excessive regulation and burdensome requirements have helped contribute to the slow economy we all endure today under president obama and the democrats. community banks are essential to ensuring small businesses have easy and affordable access to the capital they need to grow and prosper. community banks should be relieved of excessive regulations. we support removing roadblocks and regulations that prevent access to capital. the worst of dodd-frank is the consumer financial protection bureau, deliberately designed to be a rogue agency. it answers to neither congress nor the executive, has its own guaranteed funding outside the appropriations process, and uses its slush fund to steer settlements to politically favored groups. its director has dictatorial powers unique in the american republic. its regulatory harassment of local and regional banks, the source of most home mortgages and small business loans, advantages big banks and makes it harder for americans to buy a home. its one-size-fits-all approach to every issue threatens the diversity of the country’s financial system and would leave us with just a few enormous institutions, as in many european countries. if the bureau is not abolished, it should be subjected to congressional appropriation. in that way, consumer protection in the financial markets can be advanced through measures that are both effective and constitutional. any settlements arising from statutory violations by financial institutions must be used to make whole the harmed consumers, with any remaining proceeds given to the general treasury. diversion of settlement funds to politically- connected parties should be a criminal offense. republicans believe that no financial institution is too big to fail. we support legislation to ensure that the problems of any financial institution can be resolved through the bankruptcy code. we endorse prudent regulation of the banking system to ensure that fdic-regulated banks are properly capitalized and taxpayers are protected against bailouts. we will end the government’s use of disparate impact theory in enforcing anti-discrimination laws with regard to lending. responsible homeownership and rental opportunities homeownership expands personal liberty, builds communities, and helps americans create wealth. “the american dream” is not a stale slogan. it is the lived reality that expresses the aspirations of all our people. it means a decent place to live, a safe place to raise kids, a welcoming place to retire. it bespeaks the quiet pride of those who work hard to shelter their family and, in the process, create caring neighborhoods. the great recession devastated the housing market. u.s. taxpayers paid billions to rescue freddie mac and fannie mae, the latter managed and controlled by senior officials from the carter and clinton administrations, and to cover the losses of the poorly-managed federal housing administration. millions lost their homes, millions more lost value in their homes. more than six million households had to move from homeownership to renting. rental costs escalated so that today nearly million families spend more than percent of their incomes just on rent. the national homeownership rate has sharply fallen and the rate for minority households and young adults has plummeted. so many remain unemployed or underemployed, and for the lucky ones with jobs, rising rents make it harder to save for a mortgage. there is a growing sense that our national standard of living will never be as high as it was in the past. we understand that pessimism but do not share it, for we believe that sound public policies can restore growth to our economy, vigor to the housing market, and hope to those who are now on the margins of prosperity. our goal is to advance responsible home- ownership while guarding against the abuses that led to the housing collapse. we must scale back the federal role in the housing market, promote responsibility on the part of borrowers and lenders, and avoid future taxpayer bailouts. reforms should provide clear and prudent underwriting standards and guidelines on predatory lending and acceptable lending practices. compliance with regulatory standards should constitute a legal safe harbor to guard against opportunistic litigation by trial lawyers. we call for a comprehensive review of federal regulations, especially those dealing with the environment, that make it harder and more costly for americans to rent, buy, or sell homes. for nine years, fannie mae and freddie mac have been in conservatorship and the current administration and democrats have prevented any effort to reform them. their corrupt business model lets shareholders and executives reap huge profits while the taxpayers cover all loses. the utility of both agencies should be reconsidered as a republican administration clears away the jumble of subsidies and controls that complicate and distort home-buying. the federal housing administration, which provides taxpayer-backed guarantees in the mortgage market, should no longer support high- income individuals, and the public should not be financially exposed by risks taken by fha officials. we will end the government mandates that required fannie mae, freddie mac, and federally- insured banks to satisfy lending quotas to specific groups. discrimination should have no place in the mortgage industry. zoning decisions have always been, and must remain, under local control. the current administration is trying to seize control of the zoning process through its affirmatively furthering fair housing regulation. it threatens to undermine zoning laws in order to socially engineer every community in the country. while the federal government has a legitimate role in enforcing non-discrimination laws, this regulation has nothing to do with proven or alleged discrimination and everything to do with hostility to the self-government of citizens. america on the move our country's investments in transportation and other public construction have traditionally been non-partisan. everyone agrees on the need for clean water and safe roads, rail, bridges, ports, and airports. president eisenhower established a tradition of republican leadership in this regard by championing the creation of the interstate highway system. in recent years, bipartisan cooperation led to major legislation improving the nation's ports and waterways. our republican majority ended the practice of earmarks, which often diverted transportation spending to politically favored projects. in the current congress, republicans have secured the longest reauthorization of the highway trust fund in a decade and are advancing a comprehensive reform of the federal aviation administration to make flying easier and more secure. the current administration has a different approach. it subordinates civil engineering to social engineering as it pursues an exclusively urban vision of dense housing and government transit. its ill-named livability initiative is meant to “coerce people out of their cars.” this is the same mentality that once led congress to impose by fiat a single maximum speed limit for the entire nation, from manhattan to montana. our republican platform pledged to repeal that edict. after the election of ronald reagan, we did. now we make the same pledge regarding the current problems in transportation policy. we propose to remove from the highway trust fund programs that should not be the business of the federal government. more than a quarter of the fund's spending is diverted from its original purpose. one fifth of its funds are spent on mass transit, an inherently local affair that serves only a small portion of the population, concentrated in six big cities. additional funds are used for bike-share programs, sidewalks, recreational trails, landscaping, and historical renovations. other beneficiaries of highway money are ferry boats, the federal lands access program, scenic byways, and education initiatives. these worthwhile enterprises should be funded through other sources. we propose to phase out the federal transit program and reform provisions of the national environmental policy act which can delay and drive up costs for transportation projects. we renew our call for repeal of the davis-bacon law, which limits employment and drives up construction and maintenance costs for the benefit of unions. recognizing that, over time, additional revenue will be needed to expand the carrying capacity of roads and bridges, we will remove legal roadblocks to public-private partnership agreements that can save the taxpayers' money and bring outside investment to meet a community's needs. with most of the states increasing their own funding for transportation, we oppose a further increase in the federal gas tax. although unionization has never been permitted in any government agency concerned with national security, the current administration has reversed that policy for the transportation security administration. we will correct that mistake. americans understand that, with the threat of terrorism, their travel may encounter delays, but un- acceptably long lines at security checks can have the same impact as a collapsed bridge or washed out highway. tsa employees should always be seen as guardians of the public's safety, not as just another part of the federal workforce. amtrak is an extremely expensive railroad for the american taxpayers, who must subsidize every ticket. the federal government should allow private ventures to provide passenger service in the northeast corridor. the same holds true with regard to high-speed and intercity rail across the country. we reaffirm our intention to end federal support for boondoggles like california's high-speed train to nowhere. building the future: technology the digital revolution has transformed how we work, learn, sell, shop, socialize — in short, how we live. technological change drives our positions with regard to stem education, business and corporate involvement with educational certifications, workforce issues, privacy, cyber and national security, energy development, regulation, and other elements of our campaign for growth and jobs. it is why we propose to simplify the tax code, reduce corporate rates, transition to a territorial system, and create incentives for investment and innovation. we envision government at all levels as a partner with individuals and industries in technological progress, not a meddlesome monitor. we want to create a business climate that rewards risk and promotes innovation, a learning system that gives americans the skills needed to seize the opportunities of the 21st century, and an international order that maintains a fair and open global market for america's goods and services. we intend to advance policies that protect data privacy while fostering innovation and growth and ensuring the free flow of data across borders. together, broadband and good ideas have become the 21st century engines of american ingenuity. innovation, by its nature, is disruptive. in challenging legacy forms of business, innovation creates new jobs, gives access to new markets, opens opportunity to underserved populations, and expands consumer choice. government must give america's innovators the freedom to create and, on their merits, succeed or fail. our agenda includes balanced protections for intellectual property, explained elsewhere in this document. we intend to facilitate access to spectrum by paving the way for high-speed, next- generation broadband deployment and competition on the internet and for internet services. we want government to encourage the sharing economy and on-demand platforms to compete in an open market, and we believe public policies should encourage the innovation and competition that are essential for an internet of things to thrive. government must keep pace with the technology deployed in the private sector. there is an urgent need to modernize the federal government's legacy systems and to recruit the skilled technical personnel who can advance the adoption of innovation in the public sector. at the cost of billions, the current administration has done little to advance our goal of universal broadband coverage. that hurts rural america, where farmers, ranchers, and small business people need connectivity to operate in real time with the world's producers. almost ten million americans have given up wired broadband connections in just the last two years alone, and millions more have never been connected in the first place. we encourage public-private partnerships to provide predictable support for connecting rural areas so that every american can fully participate in the global economy. the public-private partnerships between nasa, the department of defense, and commercial companies have given us technological progress that has reduced the cost of accessing space and extended america's space leadership in the commercial, civil, and national security spheres. the entrepreneurship and innovation culture of the free market is revitalizing the nation's space capabilities, saving taxpayer money, and advancing technology critical to maintain america's edge in space and in other fields. to protect our national security interests and foster innovation and competitiveness, we must sustain our preeminence in space by launching more scientific missions, guaranteeing unfettered access, and ensuring that our space-related industries remain a source of scientific leadership and education. building the future: america’s electric grid our nation's interstate electric transmission system has long been a catalyst for developing and delivering low cost energy while spurring economic growth throughout the united states the grid is aging, vulnerable to cyber and terrorist threats, and unprepared to serve our energy needs of tomorrow. it should not take seven to ten years to plan and construct a transmission line. we support expedited siting processes and the thoughtful expansion of the grid so that consumers and businesses continue to have access to affordable and reliable electricity. start-up century: small business and entrepreneurship a central reason why the 20th century came to be called the american century was the ability of individuals to invent and create in a land of free markets. back then they were called risk-takers, dreamers, and small business owners. today they are the entrepreneurs, independent contractors, and small business men and women of our new economy. their innovation drives improvement and forces long-established institutions to adapt or fade away. many of them are so young they remember little if anything of the last century because dynamic progress does not look back. as in the past, they still create most new jobs and form the commercial network that holds communities together. their enterprise is the lifeblood of our economy, but it is weakening. more businesses are closing in our country than are starting. older firms are an increasing proportion of companies. productivity growth has slowed. this is not the way to jumpstart a new era of growth. we need to consider the effect of capital gains rates on the availability of venture capital, as well as the positive impact of expensing on start-up firms. we should reduce the occupational licensing laws that shut untold millions of potential workers out of entrepreneurial careers. we must overturn the regulatory nightmare, created by the dodd- frank law, for the community banks and savings and loans that provide nearly half of all small- business loans and over three-quarters of all agricultural loans. indeed, the world of the app economy cries out for the comprehensive regulatory reform proposed elsewhere in this platform. we must challenge established interests and traditional business patterns to facilitate market entry of new business models, i including inventive means of transport, delivery, and communication. as incubators of unconventional thinking, our country's existing research infrastructure — the national labs, the national institutes of health, nasa, and elements of the defense department — have the potential to form partnerships with small businesses to create an american start-up century. the federal reserve because the federal reserve's monetary policy decisions affect job creation, upward mobility for workers, and equitable prosperity, they should be transparent. similarly, the federal reserve's important role as a lender of last resort should also be carried out in a more transparent manner. the republican party will advance legislation that brings transparency and accountability to the federal reserve, the federal open market committee, and the federal reserve's dealing with foreign banks. the first step is through an annual audit of the federal reserve's activities. such an audit would need to be carefully implemented so that the federal reserve remains insulated from political pressures and its decisions are based on sound economic principles and sound money rather than political pressures for easy money and loose credit. determined to crush the double-digit inflation that was part of the carter administration's economic legacy, president reagan, shortly after his inauguration, established a commission to consider the feasibility of a metallic basis for u.s. currency. in , facing the task of cleaning up the wreckage of the current administration's policies, we proposed a similar commission to investigate ways to set a fixed value for the dollar. with republican leadership, the house of representatives has passed legislation to set up just such a commission. we recommend its enactment by the full congress and the commission's careful consideration of ways to secure the integrity of our currency. workplace freedom for a 21st century workforce the greatest asset of the american economy is the hard-working american. that is why our first priority is getting people back to work by fostering the kind of growth that creates jobs. that overarching goal unites all the sections of this platform. it runs through our commitments on education and workforce development. it underlies our approach to welfare reform, regulatory reform, and our determination to advance the kind of trade agreements that multiply opportunities for workers here at home. it also impels us to challenge the anachronistic labor laws that limit workers' freedom and lock them into the workplace rules of their greatgrandfathers. instead of facilitating change, the current administration and its agents at the national labor relations board are determined to reverse it. they are attacking the franchise model of business development, which is essential to the flexibility and creativity of the new economy. they are wielding provisions of the fair labor standards act from the 1930s, designed to fit a manufacturing workplace, to deny flexibility to both employers and employees. they have repealed union transparency rules that allowed members to discover what was being done with their dues. they have outlawed alternatives to unions even when they were favored by the workers. their project labor agreements discriminate against the overwhelming majority of workers by barring them from jobs on taxpayer-funded projects. their patronizing and controlling approach leaves workers in a form of peonage to the nlrb. we intend to restore fairness and common sense to that agency. technology has already created jobs that did not exist fifteen years ago, and today's workers need flexibility and family-friendly options to make the most of them, especially portability in pension plans and health insurance. we intend to encourage those trends by bringing labor law into the 21st century. it should encourage cooperation between management and workers, not conflict. all workers, including union members, must be free to accept raises and rewards without veto power from union officials. all unionized workers should be able to find out what is going on in their union trust funds and in their executive compensation. we support the right of states to enact right-to-work laws and call for a national law to protect the economic liberty of the modern workforce. all americans deserve the opportunity to pursue their american dream free from discrimination. clear nondiscrimination policies ensure all employees have the chance to succeed based solely on their merits. these policies are vital to creating an inclusive, innovative, and competitive workforce. republicans believe that the employer- employee relationship of the future will be built upon employee empowerment and workplace flexibility. we therefore endorse employee stock ownership plans that enable workers to become capitalists, expand the realm of private property, and energize a free enterprise economy. minimum wage is an issue that should be handled at the state and local level. a federal workforce serving the people the federal workforce is larger and more highly paid than ever. the taxpayers spend an average of $, a year per employee on non-cash benefits, triple the average non-cash compensation of the average worker in the private sector. federal employees receive extraordinary pension benefits and vacation time wildly out of line with those of the private sector. we urge congress to bring federal compensation and benefits in line with the standards of most american employees. a republican administration should streamline personnel procedures to expedite the firing of bad workers, tax cheats, and scammers. the unionization of the federal workforce, first permitted by democrat presidents in the 1960s, should be reviewed by the appropriate congressional committees to examine its effects on the cost, quality, and performance of the civil service. union representatives in the federal workforce should not be paid to conduct union business on the public's time. reducing the federal debt our national debt is a burden on our economy and families. the huge increase in the national debt demanded by and incurred during the current administration has placed a significant burden on future generations. we must impose firm caps on future debt, accelerate the repayment of the trillions we now owe in order to reaffirm our principles of responsible and limited government, and remove the burdens we are placing on future generations. a strong economy is one key to debt reduction, but spending restraint is a necessary component that must be vigorously pursued. a rebirth of constitutional government we the people we are the party of the declaration of independence and the constitution. the declaration sets forth the fundamental precepts of american government: that god bestows certain inalienable rights on every individual, thus producing human equality; that government exists first and foremost to protect those inalienable rights; that man-made law must be consistent with god-given, natural rights; and that if god-given, natural, inalienable rights come in conflict with government, court, or human-granted rights, god-given, natural, inalienable rights always prevail; that there is a moral law recognized as “the laws of nature and of nature's god”; and that american government is to operate with the consent of the governed. we are also the party of the constitution, the greatest political document ever written. it is the solemn compact built upon principles of the declaration that enshrines our god-given individual rights and ensures that all americans stand equal before the law, defines the purposes and limits of government, and is the blueprint for ordered liberty that makes the united states the world's freest and most prosperous nation. we reaffirm the constitution's fundamental principles: limited government, separation of powers, individual liberty, and the rule of law. we denounce bigotry, racism, anti-semitism, ethnic prejudice, and religious intolerance. therefore, we oppose discrimination based on race, sex, religion, creed, disability, or national origin and support statutes to end such discrimination. as the party of abraham lincoln, we must continue to foster solutions to america's difficult challenges when it comes to race relations today. we continue to encourage equality for all citizens and access to the american dream. merit and hard work should determine advancement in our society, so we reject unfair preferences, quotas, and set-asides as forms of discrimination. our ranks include americans from every faith and tradition, and we respect the right of each american to follow his or her deeply held beliefs. our constitution is in crisis. more than percent of federal requirements are now imposed by regulatory agencies, without any vote of the house or senate or signature of the president. the current administration has exceeded its constitutional authority, brazenly and flagrantly violated the separation of powers, sought to divide america into groups and turn citizen against citizen. the president has refused to defend or enforce laws he does not like, used executive orders to enact national policies in areas constitutionally reserved solely to congress, made unconstitutional “recess” appointments to senate-confirmed positions, directed regulatory agencies to overstep their statutory authority, and failed to consult congress regarding military action overseas. he has changed what john adams called “a government of laws and not of men” into just the opposite. democrats in congress have enabled, supported, and defended each of these breaches. they have applauded the president's efforts to do an end-run around congress and stymied republican efforts to restrain executive lawlessness. democrats in congress have also endorsed an anticonstitutional agenda of their own. forty-eight democratic senators, for instance, voted to amend the bill of rights to give government officials control over political speech. democrats in congress have likewise proposed bills that would limit religious liberty, undermine property rights, and eviscerate the second amendment. in a free society, the primary role of government is to protect the god-given, inalienable rights of its citizens. these constitutional rights are not negotiable for any american. we affirm that all legislation, regulation, and official actions must conform to the constitution's original meaning as understood at the time the language was adopted. our most urgent task as a party is to restore the american people's faith in their government by electing a president who will enforce duly enacted laws, honor constitutional limits on executive authority, and return credibility to the oval office. we need a republican president who will end abuses of power by departments and agencies, like the irs and the epa, and by the white house itself. safeguarding our liberties requires a president who will respect the constitution's separation of powers, including the authority of congress to write legislation and define agency authority. americans also deserve a president who will speak for our nation's history and values, not apologize for them to our enemies. the judiciary the rule of law is the foundation of our republic. a critical threat to our country's constitutional order is an activist judiciary that usurps powers properly reserved to the people through other branches of government. only a republican president will appoint judges who respect the rule of law expressed within the constitution and declaration of independence, including the inalienable right to life and the laws of nature and nature's god, as did the late justice antonin scalia. we are facing a national crisis in our judiciary. we understand that only by electing a republican president in will america have the opportunity for up to five new constitutionally-minded supreme court justices appointed to fill vacancies on the court. only such appointments will enable courts to begin to reverse the long line of activist decisions — including roe, obergefell, and the obamacare cases — that have usurped congress's and states' lawmaking authority, undermined constitutional protections, expanded the power of the judiciary at the expense of the people and their elected representatives, and stripped the people of their power to govern themselves. we believe in the constitutional checks and balances and that the founders intended the judiciary to be the weakest branch. we encourage congress to use the check of impeachment for judges who unconstitutionally usurp article i powers. in tandem with a republican senate, a new republican president will restore to the court a strong conservative majority that will follow the text and original meaning of the constitution and our laws. the legitimate powers of government are rooted in the consent of the american people. judicial activism that includes reliance on foreign law or unratified treaties undermines american sovereignty. foreign laws and precedents should not be used to interpret our constitution or laws, nor should foreign sources of law be used in state courts’ adjudication of criminal or civil matters. we also affirm the wisdom of president george washington’s warning to avoid foreign entanglements and unnecessary alliances. we therefore oppose the adoption or ratification of treaties that would weaken or encroach upon american sovereignty or that could be construed by courts to do so. we will not recognize as binding upon the united states any international agreement forged without the constitutionally required assent of two-thirds of the united states senate. administrative law article i of the constitution directs that ""all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the united states....” for more than a century, however, congress has delegated increasing amounts of legislative authority to executive departments, agencies, and commissions, laying the foundation for today’s vast administrative state. unelected bureaucrats in the executive branch now write countless rules with the force of law and arbitrarily punish individuals who disobey those rules. the constitution makes clear that these powers were granted to congress by the people and must therefore remain solely with the people’s elected representatives. we call on congress to begin reclaiming its constitutional powers from the bureaucratic state by requiring that major new federal regulations be approved by congress before they can take effect, such as through the regulation freedom amendment. we further affirm that courts should interpret laws as written by congress rather than allowing executive agencies to rewrite those laws to suit administration priorities. defending marriage against an activist judiciary traditional marriage and family, based on marriage between one man and one woman, is the foundation for a free society and has for millennia been entrusted with rearing children and instilling cultural values. we condemn the supreme court's ruling in united states v. windsor, which wrongly removed the ability of congress to define marriage policy in federal law. we also condemn the supreme court's lawless ruling in obergefell v. hodges, which in the words of the late justice antonin scalia, was a “judicial putsch” — full of “silly extravagances” — that reduced “the disciplined legal reasoning of john marshall and joseph storey to the mystical aphorisms of a fortune cookie.” in obergefell, five unelected lawyers robbed million americans of their legitimate constitutional authority to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman. the court twisted the meaning of the fourteenth amendment beyond recognition. to echo scalia, we dissent. we, therefore, support the appointment of justices and judges who respect the constitutional limits on their power and respect the authority of the states to decide such fundamental social questions. the first amendment: religious liberty the bill of rights lists religious liberty, with its rights of conscience, as the first freedom to be protected. religious freedom in the bill of rights protects the right of the people to practice their faith in their everyday lives. as george washington taught, “religion and morality are indispensable supports” to a free society. similarly, thomas jefferson declared that “no provision in our constitution ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of the civil authority.” ongoing attempts to compel individuals, businesses, and institutions of faith to transgress their beliefs are part of a misguided effort to undermine religion and drive it from the public square. as a result, many charitable religious institutions that have demonstrated great success in helping the needy have been barred from receiving government grants and contracts. government officials threaten religious colleges and universities with massive fines and seek to control their personnel decisions. places of worship for the first time in our history have reason to fear the loss of tax-exempt status merely for espousing and practicing traditional religious beliefs that have been held across the world for thousands of years, and for almost four centuries in america. we value the right of america’s religious leaders to preach, and americans to speak freely, according to their faith. republicans believe the federal government, specifically the irs, is constitutionally prohibited from policing or censoring speech based on religious convictions or beliefs, and therefore we urge the repeal of the johnson amendment. we pledge to defend the religious beliefs and rights of conscience of all americans and to safeguard religious institutions against government control. we endorse the first amendment defense act, republican legislation in the house and senate which will bar government discrimination against individuals and businesses for acting on the belief that marriage is the union of one man and one woman. this act would protect the non-profit tax status of faith-based adoption agencies, the accreditation of religious educational institutions, the grants and contracts of faith-based charities and small businesses, and the licensing of religious professions — all of which are under assault by elements of the democratic party. we encourage every state to pass similar legislation. we likewise endorse the efforts of republican state legislators and governors who have defied intimidation from corporations and the media in defending religious liberty. we support laws to confirm the longstanding american tradition that religious individuals and institutions can educate young people, receive government benefits, and participate in public debates without having to check their religious beliefs at the door. our first amendment rights are not given to us by the government but are rights we inherently possess. the government cannot use subsequent amendments to limit first amendment rights. the free exercise clause is both an individual and a collective liberty protecting a right to worship god according to the dictates of conscience. therefore, we strongly support the freedom of americans to act in accordance with their religious beliefs, not only in their houses of worship, but also in their everyday lives. we support the right of the people to conduct their businesses in accordance with their religious beliefs and condemn public officials who have proposed boycotts against businesses that support traditional marriage. we pledge to protect those business owners who have been subjected to hate campaigns, threats of violence, and other attempts to deny their civil rights. we support the public display of the ten commandments as a reflection of our history and our country's judeo-christian heritage and further affirm the rights of religious students to engage in voluntary prayer at public school events and to have equal access to school facilities. we assert the first amendment right of freedom of association for religious, private, service, and youth organizations to set their own membership standards. the first amendment: constitutionally protected speech the rights of citizenship do not stop at the ballot box. freedom of speech includes the right to devote resources to whatever cause or candidate one supports. we oppose any restrictions or conditions that would discourage citizens from participating in the public square or limit their ability to promote their ideas, such as requiring private organizations to publicly disclose their donors to the government. limits on political speech serve only to protect the powerful and insulate incumbent officeholders. we support repeal of federal restrictions on political parties in mccain-feingold, raising or repealing contribution limits, protecting the political speech of advocacy groups, corporations, and labor unions, and protecting political speech on the internet. we likewise call for an end to the so-called fairness doctrine, and support free-market approaches to free speech unregulated by government. we believe the forced funding of political candidates through union dues and other mandatory contributions violates the first amendment. just as americans have a first amendment right to devote resources to favored candidates or views, they have a first amendment right not to be forced to individually support individuals or ideologies that they oppose. we agree with thomas jefferson that “to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical.” the second amendment: our right to keep and bear arms we uphold the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, a natural inalienable right that predates the constitution and is secured by the second amendment. lawful gun ownership enables americans to exercise their god-given right of selfdefense for the safety of their homes, their loved ones, and their communities. we salute the republican congress for defending the right to keep and bear arms by preventing the president from installing a new liberal majority on the supreme court. the confirmation to the court of additional anti-gun justices would eviscerate the second amendment's fundamental protections. already, local officials in the nation's capital and elsewhere are defying the court's decisions upholding an individual right to bear arms as affirmed by the supreme court in heller and mcdonald. we support firearm reciprocity legislation to recognize the right of law-abiding americans to carry firearms to protect themselves and their families in all states. we support constitutional carry statutes and salute the states that have passed them. we oppose ill-conceived laws that would restrict magazine capacity or ban the sale of the most popular and common modern rifle. we also oppose any effort to deprive individuals of their right to keep and bear arms without due process of law. we condemn frivolous lawsuits against gun manufacturers and the current administration's illegal harassment of firearm dealers. we oppose federal licensing or registration of law-abiding gun owners, registration of ammunition, and restoration of the ill-fated clinton gun ban. we call for a thorough investigation — by a new republican administration — of the deadly “fast and furious” operation perpetrated by department of justice officials who approved and allowed illegal sales of guns to known violent criminals. the fourth amendment: liberty and privacy affirming the fourth amendment “right of the people to be secure in their houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,” we call for strict limitations on the use of aerial surveillance on u.s. soil, with the exception of patrolling our national borders for illegal entry and activity. we oppose any attempts by government to require surveillance devices in our daily lives, including tracking devices in motor vehicles. in recent years, technology companies have responded to market demand for products and services that protect the privacy of customers through increasingly sophisticated encryption technology. these increased privacy protections have become crucial to the digital economy. at the same time, however, such innovations have brought new dangers, especially from criminals and terrorists who seek to use encryption technology to harm us. no matter the medium, citizens must retain the right to communicate with one another free from unlawful government intrusion. it will not be easy to balance privacy rights with the government's legitimate need to access encrypted information. this issue is too important to be left to the courts. a republican president and a republican congress must listen to the american people and forge a consensus solution. the foreign account tax compliance act (fatca) and the foreign bank and asset reporting requirements result in government's warrantless seizure of personal financial information without reasonable suspicion or probable cause. americans overseas should enjoy the same rights as americans residing in the united states, whose private financial information is not subject to disclosure to the government except as to interest earned. the requirement for all banks around the world to provide detailed information to the irs about american account holders outside the united states has resulted in banks refusing service to them. thus, fatca not only allows “unreasonable search and seizures” but also threatens the ability of overseas americans to lead normal lives. we call for its repeal and for a change to residency-based taxation for u.s. citizens overseas. the fifth amendment: protecting human life the constitution's guarantee that no one can “be deprived of life, liberty or property” deliberately echoes the declaration of independence's proclamation that “all” are “endowed by their creator” with the inalienable right to life. accordingly, we assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed. we support a human life amendment to the constitution and legislation to make clear that the fourteenth amendment's protections apply to children before birth. we oppose the use of public funds to perform or promote abortion or to fund organizations, like planned parenthood, so long as they provide or refer for elective abortions or sell fetal body parts rather than provide healthcare. we urge all states and congress to make it a crime to acquire, transfer, or sell fetal tissues from elective abortions for research, and we call on congress to enact a ban on any sale of fetal body parts. in the meantime, we call on congress to ban the practice of misleading women on so-called fetal harvesting consent forms, a fact revealed by a investigation. we will not fund or subsidize healthcare that includes abortion coverage. we support the appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life. we oppose the non-consensual withholding or withdrawal of care or treatment, including food and water, from individuals with disabilities, newborns, the elderly, or the infirm, just as we oppose euthanasia and assisted suicide. we affirm our moral obligation to assist, rather than penalize, women who face an unplanned pregnancy. in order to encourage women who face an unplanned pregnancy to choose life, we support legislation that requires financial responsibility for the child be equally borne by both the mother and father upon conception until the child reaches adulthood. failure to require a father to be equally responsible for a child places an inequitable burden on the mother, creating a financial and social hardship on both mother and child. we celebrate the millions of americans who open their hearts, homes, and churches to mothers in need and women fleeing abuse. we thank and encourage providers of counseling, medical services, and adoption assistance for empowering women experiencing an unintended pregnancy to choose life. we support funding for ultrasounds and adoption assistance. we salute the many states that now protect women and girls through laws requiring informed consent, parental consent, waiting periods, and clinic regulation. we condemn the supreme court's activist decision in whole woman’s health v. hellerstedt striking down commonsense texas laws providing for basic health and safety standards in abortion clinics. we applaud the u.s. house of representatives for leading the effort to add enforcement to the born-alive infant protection act by passing the born-alive abortion survivors protection act, which imposes appropriate civil and criminal penalties on healthcare providers who fail to provide treatment and care to an infant who survives an abortion, including early induction delivery whether the death of the infant is intended. we strongly oppose infanticide. over a dozen states have passed pain-capable unborn child protection acts prohibiting abortion after twenty weeks, the point at which current medical research shows that unborn babies can feel excruciating pain during abortions, and we call on congress to enact the federal version. not only is it good legislation, but it enjoys the support of a majority of the american people. we support state and federal efforts against the cruelest forms of abortion, especially dismemberment abortion procedures, in which unborn babies are literally torn apart limb from limb. we call on congress to ban sex-selection abortions and abortions based on disabilities — discrimination in its most lethal form. we oppose embryonic stem cell research. we oppose federal funding of embryonic stem cell research. we support adult stem cell research and urge the restoration of the national placental stem cell bank created by president george h.w. bush but abolished by his democrat successor, president bill clinton. we oppose federal funding for harvesting embryos and call for a ban on human cloning. the democratic party is extreme on abortion. democrats' almost limitless support for abortion, and their strident opposition to even the most basic restrictions on abortion, put them dramatically out of step with the american people. because of their opposition to simple abortion clinic safety procedures, support for taxpayer-funded abortion, and rejection of pregnancy resource centers that provide abortion alternatives, the old clinton mantra of “safe, legal, and rare” has been reduced to just “legal.” we are proud to be the party that protects human life and offers real solutions for women. the fifth amendment: protecting private property the framers of our government knew, from history and experience, that when private property is not secure, freedom is at risk. that is why the fifth amendment declares that private property may not be “taken for public use without just compensation.” the supreme court's kelo decision undermined this safeguard by allowing local governments to seize a person's home or land not only for vital public use, but also for “public purpose,” which thus allowed the government to seize it for transfer to private developers or other private entities. we call on any state legislatures that have not already done so to nullify the impact of kelo within their jurisdiction by legislation or state constitutional amendments declaring that private property may be taken only for true public use, and we join house republicans in supporting the private property rights protection act. the government at every level must always pay just compensation whenever it takes private property to achieve a compelling public use, with the money coming from the budget of the agency performing the taking. this includes the taking of water rights and the taking of property by environmental regulations that destroy or diminish the property's value. civil asset forfeiture was originally intended as a way to cripple organized crime through the seizure of property used in a criminal enterprise. regrettably, it has become a tool for unscrupulous law enforcement officials, acting without due process, to profit by destroying the livelihood of innocent individuals, many of whom never recover the lawful assets taken from them. when the rights of the innocent can be so easily violated, no one's rights are safe. we call on congress and state legislatures to enact reforms to protect law-abiding citizens against abusive asset forfeiture tactics. the fifth amendment: intellectual property rights private property includes not only physical property such as lands and homes, but also intellectual property like books and patents. article , section of the constitution gives congress the power to safeguard intellectual property rights for “authors and inventors.” by protecting the proprietary rights of creators and innovators, the constitution promotes the general welfare by providing incentives for investment in all sorts of technology and artistic works. intellectual property is a driving force in today's global economy of constant innovation. it is the wellspring of american economic growth and job creation. with the rise of the digital economy, it has become even more critical that we protect intellectual property rights and preserve freedom of contract rather than create regulatory barriers to creativity, growth, and innovation. protecting intellectual property is also a national security issue. we must guard against counterfeit parts that can compromise the reliability of our weapons systems and the safety of military personnel. today, the worst offenses against intellectual property rights come from abroad, especially in china. we call for strong action by congress and a new republican president to enforce intellectual property laws against all infringers, whether foreign or domestic. the ninth amendment: the people’s retained rights the ninth amendment to the constitution declares that “[t]he enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” this provision codifies the principle that our national government derives its power from the governed and that all powers not delegated to the government are retained by the people. we call upon legislators to give full force to this fundamental principle. we welcome to our ranks all citizens who are determined to reclaim the rights of the people that have been ignored or usurped by the federal and intrusive state governments. the tenth amendment: federalism as the foundation of personal liberty federalism is a cornerstone of our constitutional system. every violation of state sovereignty by federal officials is not merely a transgression of one unit of government against another; it is an assault on the liberties of individual americans. hence the promise of the tenth amendment: “the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.” the constitution gives the federal government very few powers, and they are specifically enumerated; the states and the people retain authority over all unenumerated powers. in obedience to that principle, we condemn the current administration’s unconstitutional expansion into areas beyond those specifically enumerated, including bullying of state and local governments in matters ranging from voter identification (id) laws, to immigration, from healthcare programs to land use decisions, and from forced education curricula to school restroom policies. we pledge to restore the proper balance and vertical separation of powers between the federal government and state governments - the governments closest to, and most reflective of, the american people. we encourage states to reinvigorate their traditional role as the laboratories of democracy, propelling the nation forward through local and state innovation. big government undermines federalism through more than , grants-in-aid programs that consume more than one-sixth of the federal budget for matters that should be the exclusive responsibility of the states. through these programs, money originating from state taxpayers is returned to the states, usually greatly reduced, with myriad strings attached. these grants turn state and local elected officials into agents of the federal government. the web of conditions and regulations — especially the requirement of matching funds that comes with federal grants - transforms recipients into appendages of the washington bureaucracy. we call upon congress to help a republican president to reduce and ultimately eliminate this system of conditioned grants so that state and local taxpayers can decide for themselves what is best for their own communities. honest elections and the electoral college we oppose the national popular vote interstate compact and any other scheme to abolish or distort the procedures of the electoral college. an unconstitutional effort to impose national popular vote would be a grave threat to our federal system and a guarantee of corruption, as every ballot box in every state would offer a chance to steal the presidency. we urge state legislatures that have voted for this proposal to rescind their approval. honest elections and the right to vote honest elections are the foundation of representative government. we pledge to protect the voting rights of every citizen, as well as their rights of conscience when they are harassed or denied a job because of their contributions to a candidate or a cause. we support state efforts to ensure ballot access for the elderly, the handicapped, military personnel, and all legitimate voters. we urge state and local officials to take all appropriate steps to allow voters to cast their ballots in a timely manner. we are concerned, however, that some voting procedures may be open to abuse. for this reason, we support legislation to require proof of citizenship when registering to vote and secure photo id when voting. we strongly oppose litigation against states exercising their sovereign authority to enact such laws. in addition, to guarantee that everyone’s vote is counted, we urge that electronic voting systems have a voter-verified paper audit trail. we urge every state to join the interstate voter registration cross check program to keep voter rolls accurate and to prevent people from voting in more than one state in the same election. to guard against foreign involvement in our elections, we call for vigilance regarding online credit card contributions to candidates and campaigns. the members of our armed forces must not be denied the basic rights that they are defending for others. our troops, wherever stationed, must be allowed to vote in a timely manner. we call upon the entire military chain of command to ensure the voting rights of our citizen soldiers. the constitution gives congress authority to conduct the decennial census ""in such manner as they shall by law direct.” in order to preserve the principle of one person, one vote, we urge our elected representatives to ensure that citizenship, rather than mere residency, be made the basis for the apportionment of representatives among the states. america’s natural resources: agriculture, energy, and the environment we are the party of america's growers, producers, farmers, ranchers, foresters, miners, commercial fishermen, and all those who bring from the earth the crops, minerals, energy, and the bounties of our seas that are the lifeblood of our economy. their labor and ingenuity, their determination in bad times and love of the land at all times, powers our economy, creates millions of jobs, and feeds billions of people around the world. only a few years ago, a bipartisan consensus in government valued the role of extractive industries and rewarded their enterprise by minimizing its interference with their work. that has radically changed. we look in vain within the democratic party for leaders who will speak for the people of agriculture, energy, and mineral production abundant harvests agricultural production and exports are central to the republican agenda for jobs, growth, expanded trade, and prosperity. because our farmers and ranchers care for the land, the united states does not depend on foreign imports for sustenance. americans spend a smaller percentage of their income on food than any other nation. on average, one american farm produces enough food to feed people. no other nation has been as generous with food aid to the needy. we have good reason to celebrate our domestic security in food. we are the largest agricultural exporter in the world, and our exports are vital for other sectors of our economy. those exports drive additional economic growth as each dollar of agricultural exports generates another $. in business activity. that is why we remain committed to expanding trade opportunities and opening new markets for agriculture. under a republican president, america's trade negotiators will insist that our global trading partners adhere to science-based standards with regard to food and health regulations. we will not tolerate the use of bogus science and scare tactics to bar our products from foreign markets, nor will we allow insufficient health and safety standards for products imported for our consumption. we must also ensure that domestic policies do not compromise our global competitiveness through overregulation and undue interference in the marketplace. there is growing recognition that federal dairy policies, crafted during the great depression, are increasingly an impediment to the ability of our dairy producers to meet the expected doubling in global demand coming by . we oppose the policies pushed by special interest groups seeking to stop or make more expensive our current system of safe, efficient, and humane production of meat. congress has repeatedly had to block the current administration's draconian rules concerning the marketing of poultry and livestock. this regulatory impulse must be curbed, not on a case-by-case basis, but through a fundamental restructuring of the regulatory process. in the meantime, the intrusive and expensive federal mandates on food options and menu labeling should be ended as soon as possible by a republican congress. we oppose the mandatory labeling of genetically modified food, which has proven to be safe, healthy, and a literal life-saver for millions in the developing world. the democratic administration's sustained support for additional regulation of agriculture has directly resulted in higher costs of production for those who produce the food we eat. this federal regulatory overreach has resulted and will continue to result in higher food prices for americans. these higher food costs are particularly challenging for those americans struggling to make ends meet. like the rest of the economy, agriculture has suffered through eight years of the democrats' regulatory juggernaut, particularly from the environmental protection agency (epa). states, not washington bureaucrats, are best equipped to engage farmers and ranchers to develop sound farm oversight policies. the epa's waters of the united states (wotus) rule, issued jointly with the army corps of engineers, is a travesty. it extends the government's jurisdiction over navigable waters into the micro-management of puddles and ditches on farms, ranches, and other privately-held property. ditches, dry creek beds, stock ponds, prairie potholes, and other non- navigable wet areas are already regulated by the states. wotus is now subject to judicial review and must be invalidated, but that will not be sufficient. unelected bureaucrats must be stopped from furthering the democratic party's political agenda through regulatory demands forced upon citizens and businesses beyond that which is required by law. we must never allow federal agencies to seize control of state waters, watersheds, or groundwater. state waters, watersheds, and groundwater must be the purview of the sovereign states. farmers and ranchers are among this country's leading conservationists. modern farm practices and technologies, supported by programs from the department of agriculture, have led to reduced erosion, improved water and air quality, increased wildlife habitat, all the while maintaining improved agricultural yields. this stewardship of the land benefits everyone, and we remain committed to conservation policies based on the preservation, not the restriction, of working lands. for this reason, ranching on public lands must be fostered, developed, and encouraged. this includes providing for an abundant water supply for america's farmers, ranchers, and their communities. farming and ranching remain high-risk endeavors, and they cannot be isolated from market forces. no segment of agriculture can expect treatment so favorable that it seriously disadvantages workers in other trades. federal programs to assist farmers in managing risk must be as cost-effective as they are functional, offering tools that can improve producers' ability to operate when times are tough while remaining affordable to the taxpayers. even so, the expansion of agricultural exports through the vigorous opening of new markets around the world is the surest path to farm security. while uncertainty about natural weather and markets is a risk farmers and ranchers always face, government should not add to their uncertainty by inaction and delay. thanks in large part to a lack of leadership from the current administration and congressional democrats, the last farm bill took far too long to enact, creating instability about farm policy for nearly two years. republicans are dedicated to leading this country forward, which includes getting things done on time, including the next farm bill. the democrats play politics with farm security. much of the democrats’ delay had nothing to do with the vital role of american agriculture. it concerned their efforts to expand welfare through the supplemental nutrition assistance program (snap), which now comprises more than percent of all farm bill spending. during the last eight years of a democratic administration, nearly all the work requirements for able-bodied adults, instituted by our landmark welfare reform of , have been removed. we will restore those provisions and, to correct a mistake made when the food stamp program was first created in , separate the administration of snap from the department of agriculture. like all other sectors of our society, agriculture is directly impacted by the constant advance in technology. agriculture now faces a revolution in the generation of ""big data” — information produced not only through public oversight of regulations and programs, but also from private business records of farming and ranching operations. in the interest of protecting the safety of our farmers and ranchers, we will advance policies to protect the security, privacy, and most of all, the private ownership of individual farmers’ and ranchers’ data. the u. s. forest service, within the department of agriculture, controls around million acres of land with enormous natural resources, especially timber, a renewable resource providing jobs for thousands of workers that should be used to the best economic potential for the nation. many of our national forests are in worsening health with the threat of invasive species, insect mortality, and the severe risk of wildfire. the increase in catastrophic wildfires has been needlessly killing millions of animals and destroying homes and watersheds for decades in the western states. the expense to suppress wildfires related to failed federal forest policies continues to increase. when timber is managed properly, the renewable crops will result in fewer wildfires and, at the same time, produce jobs in the timber industry for countless families. we believe in promoting active, sustainable management of our forests and that states can best manage our forests to improve forest health and keep communities safe. a new era in energy our country has greater energy resources than any other place on earth. our engineers and miners, the men and women whose labor taps the forces of nature, are the best in the world. together, the people of america’s energy sector provide us with power that is clean, affordable, secure, and abundant. their work can guarantee the nation’s energy security for centuries to come if, instead of erecting roadblocks, government facilitates the creation of an all-of-the-above energy strategy. we applaud congressional republicans for doing just that through far-sighted legislation. both houses have passed bills that will modernize pipelines and the electric grid, protect the grid from disruption, expedite energy exports, and lower energy costs. a republican administration will build on those policies to find new ways to store electricity, a breakthrough of extraordinary import. planning for our energy future requires us to first determine what resources we have in reserve. thirty years ago, the world’s estimated reserves of oil were billion barrels. today, that figure is . trillion barrels. the more we know what we will have in the future, the better we can decide how to use it. that is why we support the opening of public lands and the outer continental shelf to exploration and responsible production, even if these resources will not be immediately developed. because we believe states can best promote economic growth while protecting the environment, congress should give authority to state regulators to manage energy resources on federally controlled public lands within their respective borders. the democratic party’s energy policy can be summed up in a slogan currently popular among its activists: ""keep it in the ground.” keeping energy in the earth will keep jobs out of reach of those who need them most. for low-income americans, expensive energy means colder homes in the winter and hotter homes in the summer, less mobility in employment, and higher food prices. the current administration, and particularly its epa, seems not to care. its clean power plan — the centerpiece of the president’s war on coal — has been stayed by the supreme court. we will do away with it altogether. the democratic party does not understand that coal is an abundant, clean, affordable, reliable domestic energy resource. those who mine it and their families should be protected from the democratic party’s radical anticoal agenda. the democratic party’s campaign to smother the u.s. energy industry takes many forms, but the permitting process may be its most damaging weapon. it takes an average of days for states to permit an oil or gas well. it takes the federal government longer than seven months. three decades ago, the bureau of land management (blm) leased . million acres. in , it leased only one-tenth of that number. our nuclear industry, cleanly generating almost percent of our electricity from its plants, has a remarkable safety record, but only a handful of plants have been permitted in over three decades. permitting for a safe, non-polluting hydroelectric facility, even one that is being relicensed, can take many years because of the current president’s hostility to dams. the keystone pipeline has become a symbol of everything wrong with the current administration’s ideological approach. after years of delay, the president killed it to satisfy environmental extremists. we intend to finish that pipeline and others as part of our commitment to north american energy security. government should not play favorites among energy producers. the taxpayers will not soon forget the current administration’s subsidies to companies that went bankrupt without producing a kilowatt of energy. the same administration now requires the department of defense, operating with slashed budgets during a time of expanding conflict, to use its scarce resources to generate percent of its electricity from renewables by . climate change is far from this nation’s most pressing national security issue. this is the triumph of extremism over common sense, and congress must stop it. we support the development of all forms of energy that are marketable in a free economy without subsidies, including coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear power, and hydropower. a federal judge has struck down the blm’s rule on hydraulic fracturing and we support upholding this decision. we respect the states’ proven ability to regulate the use of hydraulic fracturing, methane emissions, and horizontal drilling, and we will end the administration’s disregard of the nuclear waste policy act with respect to the long-term storage of nuclear waste. we encourage the cost-effective development of renewable energy sources — wind, solar, biomass, biofuel, geothermal, and tidal energy — by private capital. the united states is overwhelmingly dependent on china and other nations for rare earth and other hardrock minerals. these minerals are critical to advanced technology, renewable energy, and defense manufacturing. we support expediting the permitting process for mineral production on public lands. we support lifting restrictions to allow responsible development of nuclear energy, including research into alternative processes like thorium nuclear energy. we oppose any carbon tax. it would increase energy prices across the board, hitting hardest at the families who are already struggling to pay their bills in the democrats’ no-growth economy. we urge the private sector to focus its resources on the development of carbon capture and sequestration technology still in its early stages here and overseas. american energy producers should be free to export their product to foreign markets. this is particularly important because of international demand for liquefied natural gas, and we must expedite the energy export terminals currently blocked by the administration. energy exports will create high paying jobs throughout the united states, reduce our nation’s trade deficit, grow our economy, and boost the energy security of our allies and trading partners. we remain committed to aggressively expanding trade opportunities and opening new markets for american energy through multilateral and bilateral agreements, whether current, pending, or negotiated in the future. energy is both an economic and national security issue. we support the enactment of policies to increase domestic energy production, including production on public lands, to counter market manipulation by opec and other nationally- owned oil companies. this will reduce america’s vulnerability to energy price volatility. environmental progress conservation is inherent in conservatism. as the pioneer of environmentalism a century ago, the republican party reaffirms the moral obligation to be good stewards of the god-given natural beauty and resources of our country. we believe that people are the most valuable resources and that human health and safety are the proper measurements of a policy’s success. we assert that private ownership has been the best guarantee of conscientious stewardship, while some of the worst instances of degradation have occurred under government control. poverty, not wealth, is the gravest threat to the environment, while steady economic growth brings the technological advances which make environmental progress possible. the environment is too important to be left to radical environmentalists. they are using yesterday's tools to control a future they do not comprehend. the environmental establishment has become a self-serving elite, stuck in the mindset of the 1970s, subordinating the public's consensus to the goals of the democratic party. their approach is based on shoddy science, scare tactics, and centralized command-and-control regulation. over the last eight years, the administration has triggered an avalanche of regulation that wreaks havoc across our economy and yields minimal environmental benefits. the central fact of any sensible environmental policy is that, year by year, the environment is improving. our air and waterways are much healthier than they were a few decades ago. as a nation, we have drastically reduced pollution, mainstreamed recycling, educated the public, and avoided ecological degradation. even if no additional controls are added, air pollution will continue to decline for the next several decades due to technological turnover of aging equipment. these successes become a challenge for democratic party environmental extremists, who must reach farther and demand more to sustain the illusion of an environmental crisis. that is why they routinely ignore costs, exaggerate benefits, and advocate the breaching of constitutional boundaries by federal agencies to impose environmental regulation. at the same time, the environmental establishment looks the other way when environmental degradation is caused by the epa and other federal agencies as was the case during the animas river spill. our agenda is high on job creation, expanding opportunity and providing a better chance at life for everyone willing to work for it. our modern approach to environmentalism is directed to that end, and it starts with dramatic change in official washington. we propose to shift responsibility for environmental regulation from the federal bureaucracy to the states and to transform the epa into an independent bipartisan commission, similar to the nuclear regulatory commission, with structural safeguards against politicized science. we will strictly limit congressional delegation of rule-making authority, and require that citizens be compensated for regulatory takings. we will put an end to the legal practice known as “sue and settle,” in which environmental groups sue federal agencies whose officials are complicit in the litigation so that, with the taxpayers excluded, both parties can reach agreement behind closed doors. that deceit betrays the public's trust; it will no longer be tolerated. we will also reform the equal access to justice act to cap and disclose payments made to environmental activists and return the act to its original intent. we will enforce the original intent of the clean water act, not it's distortion by epa regulations. we will likewise forbid the epa to regulate carbon dioxide, something never envisioned when congress passed the clean air act. we will restore to congress the authority to set the national ambient air quality standards and modernize the permitting process under the national environmental policy act so it can no longer invite frivolous lawsuits, thwart sorely needed projects, kill jobs, and strangle growth. the federal government owns or controls over million acres of land in the united states, most of which is in the west. these are public lands, and the public should have access to them for appropriate activities like hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting. federal ownership or management of land also places an economic burden on counties and local communities in terms of lost revenue to pay for things such as schools, police, and emergency services. it is absurd to think that all that acreage must remain under the absentee ownership or management of official washington. congress shall immediately pass universal legislation providing for a timely and orderly mechanism requiring the federal government to convey certain federally controlled public lands to states. we call upon all national and state leaders and representatives to exert their utmost power and influence to urge the transfer of those lands, identified in the review process, to all willing states for the benefit of the states and the nation as a whole. the residents of state and local communities know best how to protect the land where they work and live. they practice boots-on- the-ground conservation in their states every day. we support amending the antiquities act of to establish congress’ right to approve the designation of national monuments and to further require the approval of the state where a national monument is designated or a national park is proposed. there is certainly a need to protect certain species threatened worldwide with extinction. however, the endangered species act (esa) should not include species such as gray wolves and other species if these species exist elsewhere in healthy numbers in another state or country. to upset the economic viability of an area with an unneeded designation costs jobs and hurts local communities. we must ensure that this protection is done effectively, reasonably, and without unnecessarily impeding the development of lands and natural resources. the esa should ensure that the listing of endangered species and the designation of critical habitats are based upon sound science and balance the protection of endangered species with the costs of compliance and the rights of property owners. instead, over the last few decades, the esa has stunted economic development, halted the construction of projects, burdened landowners, and has been used to pursue policy goals inconsistent with the esa — all with little to no success in the actual recovery of species. for example, we oppose the listing of the lesser prairie chicken and the potential listing of the sage grouse. neither species has been shown to be in actual danger and the listings threaten to devastate farmers, ranchers, and oil and gas production. while species threatened with extinction must be protected under the esa, any such protection must be done in a reasonable and transparent manner with stakeholder input and in consideration of the impact on the development of lands and natural resources. information concerning a changing climate, especially projections into the long-range future, must be based on dispassionate analysis of hard data. we will enforce that standard throughout the executive branch, among civil servants and presidential appointees alike. the united nations’ intergovernmental panel on climate change is a political mechanism, not an unbiased scientific institution. its unreliability is reflected in its intolerance toward scientists and others who dissent from its orthodoxy. we will evaluate its recommendations accordingly. we reject the agendas of both the kyoto protocol and the paris agreement, which represent only the personal commitments of their signatories; no such agreement can be binding upon the united states until it is submitted to and ratified by the senate. we demand an immediate halt to u.s. funding for the u.n.’s framework convention on climate change (unfccc) in accordance with the foreign relations authorization act. that law prohibits washington from giving any money to ""any affiliated organization of the united nations” which grants palestinians membership as a state. there is no ambiguity in that language. it would be illegal for the president to follow through on his intention to provide millions in funding for the unfccc and hundreds of millions for its green climate fund. we firmly believe environmental problems are best solved by giving incentives for human ingenuity and the development of new technologies, not through top-down, command-and-control regulations that stifle economic growth and cost thousands of jobs. government reform making government work for the people founding father and constitution framer james wilson declared that in america, “the people are the masters of government,” but that in other countries, “the government is master of the people.” we pledge to make government work for the people, rather than the other way around. much of what the federal government does can be improved, much should be replaced, and much needs to be done away with or returned to the states. it is long past time for just tinkering around the edges of a bloated and unresponsive bureaucratic state. its poorly managed programs, some begun generations ago, are ill-suited to meet present needs and future requirements. its credit card budgets impose massive indebtedness on every american today and on children yet unborn. the more it intrudes into every aspect of american life the more it alienates the citizens who work, pay taxes, and wonder what has happened to the country they love. we agree with thomas jefferson that “[t]he multiplication of public offices, increase of expense beyond income, growth and entailment of a public debt, are indications soliciting the employment of the pruning knife.” balancing the budget the federal fiscal burden threatens the security, liberty, and independence of our nation. the current administration's refusal to work with republicans took our national debt from $ trillion to nearly $ trillion today. left unchecked, it will hit $ trillion by . at the same time, the administration's policies systematically crippled economic growth and job creation, driving up government costs and driving down revenues. when congressional republicans tried to reverse course, the administration manufactured fiscal crises — phony government shutdowns — to demand excessive spending. the administration's demands have focused on significantly expanding government spending and benefits for its preferred groups, paid for through loans that our children and grandchildren will have to pay. this is the path to bankrupting the next generation. the republican path to fiscal sanity and economic expansion begins with a constitutional requirement for a federal balanced budget. we will fight for congress to adopt, and for the states to ratify, a balanced budget amendment which imposes a cap limiting spending to the appropriate historical average percentage of our nation's gross domestic product while requiring a super-majority for any tax increase, with exceptions only for war or legitimate emergencies. only a constitutional safeguard such as this can prevent deficits from mounting to government default. republican budgets will prioritize thrift over extravagance and put taxpayers first. we support the following test: is a particular expenditure within the constitutional scope of the federal government? if not, stop it. has it been effective in the past and is it still absolutely necessary? if not, end it. is it so important as to justify borrowing, especially foreign borrowing, to fund it? if not, kill it. preserving medicare and medicaid more than million americans depend on medicare or medicaid for their healthcare; with our population aging, that number will increase. to preserve medicare and medicaid, the financing of these important programs must be brought under control before they consume most of the federal budget, including national defense. the good news is that it can be done, and it can be done without endangering the elderly and the needy who depend on those programs. we intend to save medicare by modernizing it, empowering its participants, and putting it on a secure financial footing. we will preserve the promise of medicaid as well by making that program, designed for medicine, a vehicle for good health in an entirely new era. medicare’s long-term debt is in the trillions, and it is funded by a workforce that is shrinking relative to the size of future beneficiaries. obamacare worsened the situation — and imperiled seniors — by imposing hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to medicare providers to pay for its new spending. when a vital program is so clearly headed for a train wreck, it’s time to put it on a more secure track. that is why we propose these reforms: impose no changes for persons or older. give others the option of traditional medicare or transition to a premium-support model designed to strengthen patient choice, promote cost-saving competition among providers, and better guard against the fraud and abuse that now diverts billions of dollars every year away from patient care. guarantee to every enrollee an income-adjusted contribution toward a plan of their choice, with catastrophic protection. without disadvantaging present retirees or those nearing retirement, a more realistic age for eligibility in light of today’s longer life span. this is an agenda to improve healthcare, not just to manage its costs. we reject the democrats’ approach of rationing inherent in obamacare. we recognize the de facto rationing of healthcare caused by reduced access to doctors who increasingly opt out of participating in medicare and medicaid. we will not accept that or any other approach which denies care — or lowers its quality — for america’s elderly. medicaid presents related, but somewhat different challenges. as the dominant force in the health market with regard to long-term care, births, and persons with mental illness, it is the next frontier of welfare reform. it is simply too big and too flawed to be administered from washington. most of the vaunted expansion of health insurance coverage under obamacare actually has been an unprecedented expansion of the medicaid rolls in many states. we applaud the republican governors and state legislators who have undertaken the hard work of modernizing medicaid. we will give them a free hand to do so by block-granting the program without strings. their initiatives — whether premium supports for purchasing insurance, refundable tax credits, alternatives to hospitalization for chronic patients, disease prevention activities, and other innovations — are the best strategy for preserving medicaid for those who need it the most. block granting medicaid is particularly needed to address mental health care. mental illness affects people from all walks of life, but there has been little success in developing effective system-wide medical models for addressing mental health. for a variety of unique reasons, government is often the first frontier for people experiencing mental health problems — from first responders who deal with crises to publicly funded mental health facilities and prisons where large numbers of inmates suffer from mental illnesses. using block grants would allow states to experiment with different systems to address mental health and develop successful models to be replicated in states across the nation. the current federally dictated mental health care regime is wasteful and ineffective, and moving to a block grant approach would allow for state and local governments to create solutions for individuals and families in desperate need of help in addressing mental illness. we respect the states’ authority and flexibility to exclude abortion providers from federal programs such as medicaid and other healthcare and family planning programs so long as they continue to perform or refer for elective abortions or sell the body parts of aborted children. saving social security we reject the old maxim that social security is the ""third rail” of american politics, deadly for anyone who would change it. the democratic party still treats it that way, even though everyone knows that its current course will lead to a financial and social disaster. younger americans have lost all faith in the program and expect little return for what they are paying into it. as the party of america’s future, we accept the responsibility to preserve and modernize a system of retirement security forged in an old industrial era beyond the memory of most americans. current retirees and those close to retirement can be assured of their benefits. of the many reforms being proposed, all options should be considered to preserve social security. as republicans, we oppose tax increases and believe in the power of markets to create wealth and to help secure the future of our social security system. saving social security is more than a challenge. it is our moral obligation to those who trusted in the government's word. protecting internet freedom the survival of the internet as we know it is at risk. its gravest peril originates in the white house, the current occupant of which has launched a campaign, both at home and internationally, to subjugate it to agents of government. the president ordered the chair of the supposedly independent federal communications commission to impose upon the internet rules devised in the 1930s for the telephone monopoly. he has unilaterally announced america's abandonment of the international internet by surrendering u.s. control of the root zone of web names and addresses. he threw the internet to the wolves, and they - russia, china, iran, and others - are ready to devour it. we salute the congressional republicans who have legislatively impeded his plans to turn over the information freedom highway to regulators and tyrants. that fight must continue, for its outcome is in doubt. we will consistently support internet policies that allow people and private enterprise to thrive, without providing new and expanded government powers to tax and regulate so that the internet does not become the vehicle for a dramatic expansion of government power. the internet's independence is its power. it has unleashed innovation, enabled growth, and inspired freedom more rapidly and extensively than any other technological advance in human history. we will therefore resist any effort to shift control toward governance by international or other intergovernmental organizations. we will ensure that personal data receives full constitutional protection from government overreach. the only way to safeguard or improve these systems is through the private sector. the internet's free market needs to be free and open to all ideas and competition without the government or service providers picking winners and losers. immigration and the rule of law our party is the natural home for those who come in search of freedom and justice. we welcome all to the great opportunity party. the greatest asset of the american economy is the american worker. our immigration system must protect american working families and their wages, for citizens and legal immigrants alike, in a way that will improve the economy. just as immigrant labor helped build our country in the past, today's legal immigrants are making vital contributions in every aspect of national life. their industry and commitment to american values strengthens our economy, enriches our culture, and enables us to better understand and more effectively compete with the rest of the world. we are particularly grateful to the thousands of new legal immigrants, many of them not yet citizens, who are serving in the armed forces and among first responders. their patriotism should encourage all to embrace the newcomers legally among us, assist their journey to full citizenship, and help their communities avoid isolation from the mainstream of society. we are also thankful for the many legal immigrants who continue to contribute to american society. to that end, we both encourage the preservation of heritage tongues and support english as the nation's official language, a unifying force essential for the advancement of immigrant communities and our nation as a whole. america's immigration policy must serve the national interest of the united states, and the interests of american workers must be protected over the claims of foreign nationals seeking the same jobs. with all our fellow citizens, we have watched, in anger and disgust, the mocking of our immigration laws by a president who made himself superior to the will of the nation. we stand with the victims of his policies, especially the families of murdered innocents. illegal immigration endangers everyone, exploits the taxpayers, and insults all who aspire to enter america legally. we oppose any form of amnesty for those who, by breaking the law, have disadvantaged those who have obeyed it. the executive amnesties of and are a direct violation of federal law and usurp the powers of congress as outlined in article i of the constitution. these unlawful amnesties must be immediately rescinded by a republican president. in a time of terrorism, drug cartels, human trafficking, and criminal gangs, the presence of millions of unidentified individuals in this country poses grave risks to the safety and sovereignty of the united states. our highest priority, therefore, must be to secure our borders and all ports of entry and to enforce our immigration laws. that is why we support building a wall along our southern border and protecting all ports of entry. the border wall must cover the entirety of the southern border and must be sufficient to stop both vehicular and pedestrian traffic. we insist upon workplace enforcement of verification systems so that more jobs can be available to all legal workers. use of the e-verify program — an internet-based system that verifies the employment authorization and identity of employees — must be made mandatory nationwide. we reaffirm our endorsement of the save program — systematic alien verification for entitlements — to ensure that public funds are not given to persons not legally present in this country. we demand tough penalties against those who engage in identity theft, deal in fraudulent documents, and traffic in human beings. the department of homeland security must use its authority to keep dangerous aliens off our streets and to expedite expulsion of criminal aliens. gang membership should be a deportable offense. any previously deported illegal alien who continues to show a lack of respect for our borders and rule of law must be penalized. this is why we support stiffer penalties, such as a mandatory minimum sentence of five years, for any illegal alien who illegally re-enters our nation after already having been deported. because “sanctuary cities” violate federal law and endanger their own citizens, they should not be eligible for federal funding. using state licenses to reward people in the country illegally is an affront to the rule of law and must be halted. in light of both current needs and historic practice, we urge the reform of our guest worker programs to eliminate fraud, improve efficiency and ensure they serve the national interest. in light of the alarming levels of unemployment and underemployment in this country, it is indefensible to continue offering lawful permanent residence to more than one million foreign nationals every year. the supreme court has correctly recognized that states have the constitutional authority to take steps to reduce illegal immigration. we condemn the obama administration’s lawsuits against states that are seeking to reinforce federal law. we support the right of the states to enact laws deterring illegal aliens from residing within their states. from its beginning, our country has been a haven of refuge and asylum. that should continue — but with major changes. asylum should be limited to cases of political, ethnic or religious persecution. as the director of the fbi has noted, it is not possible to vet fully all potential refugees. to ensure our national security, refugees who cannot be carefully vetted cannot be admitted to the country, especially those whose homelands have been the breeding grounds for terrorism. reforming the treaty system we intend to restore the treaty system specified by the constitution: the president negotiates agreements, submits them to the senate, with ratification requiring two-thirds of the senators present and voting. this was good enough for george washington but is too restrictive for the current chief executive, who presumes to bind this country to bilateral and multilateral agreements of his devising. his media admirers portray his personal commitments — whether on climate change, iranian weapons, or other matters — as done deals. they are not, and a new republican executive will work with the congress to reestablish constitutional order in america’s foreign relations. all international executive agreements and political arrangements entered into by the current administration must be deemed null and void as mere expressions of the current president’s preferences. those which are in the national interest but would traditionally have been made by treaty must be abrogated, renegotiated as treaties, and transmitted to the senate for its advice and consent as required by the constitution. the united states will withdraw from all agreements and arrangements failing those standards. internal revenue service many good civil servants work at the irs, but the agency itself is toxic. its leadership employs known tax delinquents, rehires workers previously fired for misconduct, spends user fees without congressional oversight, and awards bonuses for customer service that would put any private company out of business. worst of all, the irs has become an ideological attack dog for the worst elements of today's democratic party. it systematically targets conservative, pro-life, and libertarian organizations, harassing them with repeated audits and denying their tax exempt status. its commissioner has lied to congress, hidden evidence, and stonewalled investigations. he should be impeached by the house of representatives and convicted by the senate. we value the right of america's churches, pastors, and religious leaders to preach and speak freely according to their faith. republicans believe the federal government, specifically the irs, is constitutionally prohibited from policing or censoring the speech of america's churches, pastors, and religious leaders. we support repeal of the johnson amendment, which restricts first amendment freedoms of all nonprofit organizations by prohibiting political speech. we also support making the federal tax code so simple and easy to understand that the irs becomes obsolete and can be abolished. audit the pentagon no major part of the department of defense has ever passed an audit. republican leaders in congress have called for a full financial audit of the pentagon to ensure that every dollar spent is truly benefitting our national security. every taxpayer must be prepared to pass an audit, and we urge congress to demand the same level of accountability from the pentagon and the department of defense. improving the federal workforce we recognize the dedication of most employees of the federal government and thank them for their service, with special praise for the whistleblowers who risk their careers to expose waste, fraud, and misuse of power. none of them should ever be compelled to join a union or pay dues to it. in fairness to their fellow workers, union representatives should not be allowed to engage in union-related activities while on the public's time. the inability of federal managers to discipline and, if necessary, dismiss problem staff members is an affront to every conscientious worker, as is the misuse of funds for lavish conferences and routine bonuses. the appointees of a republican president will work with career managers to end those abuses and enforce high standards for all federal employees. we reaffirm the existing protections that provide all employees of the federal government the opportunity to pursue their desire to serve their country free from discrimination. we call for renewed efforts to reduce, rather than expand, government responsibilities, and we urge particular attention to the bloated public relations budgets of the departments and agencies. the federal government spends too much of the people's money telling the people what they should do. advancing term limits our national platform has repeatedly endorsed term limits for members of congress. in response, the gop leadership in brought to a vote, in both the house and senate, a constitutional amendment. it failed to secure the necessary two-thirds vote in the house, where percent of republicans voted for it and percent of democrats voted against it. every senate republican voted to allow a vote on term limits, but the democrats killed it by a filibuster. blocked by that opposition, republicans sought other ways to modernize the national legislature. they set term limits for their own committee chairs and leadership positions, and by law they required congress to live by the same rules it imposes on others. to make further progress, to advance a constitutional amendment for consideration by the states, we must expand the current republican majorities in both chambers. regulation: the quiet tyranny over-regulation is the quiet tyranny of the ""nanny state.” it hamstrings american businesses and hobbles economic growth. the great recession may be over, but in the experience of most americans, the economy is still sick. the federal regulatory burden has been a major contributor to that stagnation. the ability of the american people to govern themselves has been undermined by a vast array of agencies with sweeping power to regulate every aspect of american life. they legislate as if they were congress. they decide guilt and issue penalties as if they were courts. they collectively impose many billions of dollars in costs to the economy. the current president and his allies on capitol hill have used those agencies as a superlegislature, disregarding the separation of powers, to declare as law what they could not push through the congress. the environmental protection agency has rewritten laws to advance the democrats’ climate change agenda. the department of health and human services has ignored the enacted text of the affordable care act to do whatever it wants in healthcare. both the department of labor and national labor relations board have scrapped decades of labor law to implement the agenda of big labor. the dodd-frank law, the democrats’ legislative godzilla, is crushing small and community banks and other lenders. the federal communications commission is imperiling the freedom of the internet. we support reinstating the glass-steagall act of which prohibits commercial banks from engaging in high-risk investment. sensible regulations can be compatible with a vibrant economy. they can prevent the strong from exploiting the weak. right now, the regulators are exploiting everyone. we are determined to make regulations minimally intrusive, confined to their legal mandate, and respectful toward the creation of new and small businesses. we will revisit existing laws that delegate too much authority to regulatory agencies and review all current regulations for possible reform or repeal. we endorse republican legislation, already passed by the house, to require approval by both houses of congress for any rule or regulation that would impose significant costs on the american people. further, congress should work towards legislation that requires removal of a regulation of equal or greater economic burden when a new regulation is enacted. because regulations are just another tax on the consumers, congress should consider a regulatory budget that would cap the costs federal agencies could impose on the economy in any given year. crony capitalism and corporate welfare cronyism is inherent in the progressive vision of the administrative state. when government uses taxpayer funding and resources to give special advantages to private companies, it distorts the free market and erodes public trust in our political system. by enlarging the scope of government and placing enormous power in the hands of bureaucrats, it multiplies opportunities for corruption and favoritism. it is the enemy of reform in education, the workplace, and healthcare. it gives us financial regulation that protects the large at the cost of the small. it is inherent in every part of the current healthcare law, which is packed with corporate welfare. crony capitalism gives us special interest tax breaks, custom-designed regulations, and special exemptions for favored parties. the solyndra debacle is a perfect example. it creates both subsidies and restrictions to tilt the market one way or the other. by putting the weight of government behind the status quo, it leads to economic stagnation. we applaud the republican members of congress who have taken the lead in fighting crony capitalism and urge others to rally to their cause. honoring our relationship with american indians based on both treaty and other law, the federal government has a unique government-to- government relationship with and trust responsibility for indian tribal governments, american indians, and alaska natives. these obligations have not been sufficiently honored. the social and economic problems that plague indian country have grown worse over the last several decades; we must reverse that trend. ineffective federal programs deprive american indians of the services they need, and long-term failures threaten to undermine tribal sovereignty itself. american indians have established elected tribal governments to carry out the public policies of the tribe, administer services to its tribal member constituents, and manage relations with federal, state, and local governments. we respect the tribal governments as the voice of their communities and encourage federal, state, and local governments to heed those voices in developing programs and partnerships to improve the quality of life for american indians and their neighbors in their communities. republicans believe that economic self-sufficiency is the ultimate answer to the challenges confronting indian country. we believe that tribal governments and their communities, not washington bureaucracies, are best situated to craft solutions that will end systemic problems that create poverty and disenfranchisement. just as the federal government should not burden states with regulations, it should not stifle the development of resources within the reservations, which need federal assistance to advance their commerce nationally through roads and technology. federal and state regulations that thwart job creation must be withdrawn or redrawn so that tribal governments acting on behalf of american indians are not disadvantaged. it is especially egregious that the democratic party has persistently undermined tribal sovereignty in order to provide advantage to union bosses in the tribal workplace. native communities should have the same authority as state governments in labor matters, so that union bosses and the national labor relations board (nlrb) cannot undermine the authority of tribal governments. republicans recognize that each tribe has the right of consultation before any new regulatory policy is implemented on tribal land. to the extent possible, such consultation should take place in indian country with the tribal government and its members. before promulgating and imposing any new laws or regulations affecting trust land or members, the federal government should encourage indian tribes to develop their own policies to achieve program objectives, and should defer to tribes to develop their own standards, or standards in conjunction with state governments. republicans reject a one-size-fits-all approach to federal-tribal-state partnerships and will work to expand local autonomy where tribal governments seek it. better partnerships will help us to expand economic opportunity, deliver top-flight education to future generations, modernize and improve the indian health service to make it more responsive to local needs, and build essential infrastructure in indian country in cooperation with tribal neighbors. our approach is to empower american indians, through tribal self-determination and selfgovernance policies, to develop their greatest assets, human resources and the rich natural resources on their lands, without undue federal interference. like all americans, american indians want safe communities for their families; but inadequate resources and neglect have, over time, allowed criminal activities to plague indian country. to protect everyone — and especially the most vulnerable: children, women, and elders — the legal system in tribal communities must provide stability and protect property rights. everyone's due process and civil rights must be safeguarded. we support efforts to ensure equitable participation in federal programs by american indians, including alaska natives and native hawaiians, and to preserve their culture and languages that we consider to be national treasures. lastly, we recognize that american indians have responded to the call for military service in percentage numbers far greater than have other groups of americans. we honor that commitment, loyalty, and sacrifice of all american indians serving in the military today and in years past and will ensure that all veterans and their families receive the care and respect they have earned through their loyal service to america. americans in the territories throughout the history of our nation, the patriotism exhibited by our brothers and sisters in the territories of guam, the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands, american samoa, the u.s. virgin islands, and puerto rico has often gone unacknowledged. year after year, the citizens quietly, without fanfare, send their sons and daughters into the u.s. armed services. we honor the extraordinary sacrifices of the men and women of the territories who protect our freedom through their service in the u.s. armed forces. geographically, the territories and commonwealths, especially those in the pacific, are of vital importance to our national security as the outermost line of defense and gateway to america against potential encroachment by foreign powers. we welcome their greater participation in all aspects of the political process and affirm their right to seek the full extension of the constitution with all the rights and responsibilities that entails. we recognize the challenges facing all the u.s. territories in an era of dramatic global economic change. they need venture capital to retain existing industries and develop new ones. a stronger private sector can reduce dependence on public employment and lead toward self-sufficiency. their development of local energy options will be crucial to reduce dependence on costly imported fuel. the territories’ economic stability and potential for growth must be considered in any trade agreements between the united states and other pacific nations. they should be given flexibility or exemption from laws that increase costs for their populations, such as the minimum wage and the jones act concerning shipping. all unreasonable impediments to their prosperity should be removed, including unreasonable u.s. customs practices. territories such as american samoa should be able to properly develop their resources, including fishing, when jobs and the economy depend on it. we call for the appointment of a commonwealth and territories advisory committee consisting of representatives from all five u.s. territories. the committee will be integrated into the president’s transition team and be tasked with performing a holistic review of all federal regulations affecting the territories and commonwealths. we further call for the appointment of a special assistant to the president responsible for day-to-day interaction with the territories and commonwealths. this position will be the direct connection for the office of insular affairs, the citizens of the territories and commonwealths, and the white house. the territory of puerto rico we support the right of the united states citizens of puerto rico to be admitted to the union as a fully sovereign state. we further recognize the historic significance of the local referendum in which a percent majority voted to end puerto rico’s current status as a u.s. territory, and percent chose statehood over options for sovereign nationhood. we support the federally sponsored political status referendum authorized and funded by an act of congress in to ascertain the aspirations of the people of puerto rico. once the local vote for statehood is ratified, congress should approve an enabling act with terms for puerto rico’s future admission as the 51st state of the union. preserving the district of columbia the nation’s capital city is a special responsibility of the federal government because it belongs both to its residents and to all americans, millions of whom visit it every year. congressional republicans have fostered homeownership and open access to higher education for washington residents. against the opposition of the current president and leaders of the democratic party, they have established and expanded the d.c. opportunity scholarship program, through which thousands of low-income children have been able to attend a school of their choice and receive a quality education. republicans have been in the forefront of combating chronic corruption among the city’s top democratic officials. we call for congressional action to enforce the spirit of the home rule act, assuring minority representation on the city council. that council, backed by the current mayor, is attempting to seize from the congress its appropriating power over all funding for the district. the illegality of their action mirrors the unacceptable spike in violent crime and murders currently afflicting the city. we expect congress to assert, by whatever means necessary, its constitutional prerogatives regarding the district. since the supreme court’s decisions affirming the second amendment rights of its citizens, city officials have engaged in a campaign of massive resistance by denying virtually all applications for gun ownership. the republican congress should be prepared, upon the inauguration of a republican president, to enact legislation allowing law-abiding washingtonians to own and carry firearms. statehood for the district can be advanced only by a constitutional amendment. any other approach would be invalid. a statehood amendment was soundly rejected by the states when last proposed in and should not be revived. great american families, education, healthcare, and criminal justice american values we are the party of independent individuals and the institutions they create together — families, schools, congregations, neighborhoods — to advance their ideals and make real their dreams. those institutions, standing between the citizen and the power of government, are the pillars of a free society. they create spaces where the power of government should not intrude. they allow americans to work together to solve most of the problems facing their communities. they thus reduce the need for intervention by government in the form of more and bigger programs or a larger public workforce. they minimize decision-making by those who hold or are appointed to office. that is precisely why today’s progressives distrust and seek to control them — because this is more than a conflict of ideas. it is a struggle for power. our society is at a crossroads. for several generations, an expansive federal regime has marginalized and supplanted the institutions holding our society together. no wonder, then, that so much seems to be coming apart now. the question is whether we are going to reinvigorate the private- sector institutions under citizen control or allow their continued erosion by the forces of centralized social planning. in that divide, the republican party stands with the people. marriage, family, and society foremost among those institutions is the american family. it is the foundation of civil society, and the cornerstone of the family is natural marriage, the union of one man and one woman. its daily lessons — cooperation, patience, mutual respect, responsibility, self-reliance — are fundamental to the order and progress of our republic. strong families, depending upon god and one another, advance the cause of liberty by lessening the need for government in their daily lives. conversely, as we have learned over the last five decades, the loss of faith and family life leads to greater dependence upon government. that is why republicans formulate public policy, from taxation to education, from healthcare to welfare, with attention to the needs and strengths of the family. it is also why everyone should be concerned about the state of the american family today, not because of ideology or doctrine, but because of the overwhelming evidence of experience, social science, and common sense. all of which give us these truths about traditional marriage: children raised in a two-parent household tend to be physically and emotionally healthier, more likely to do well in school, less likely to use drugs and alcohol, engage in crime or become pregnant outside of marriage. we oppose policies and laws that create a financial incentive for or encourage cohabitation. moreover, marriage remains the greatest antidote to child poverty. the percent of children who now are born outside of marriage are five times more likely to live in poverty than youngsters born and raised by a mother and father in the home. nearly three-quarters of the $ billion government annually spends on welfare goes to single-parent households. this is what it takes for a governmental village to raise a child, and the village is doing a tragically poor job of it. the data and the facts lead to an inescapable conclusion: every child deserves a married mom and dad. the reality remains that millions of american families do not have the advantages that come with that structure. we honor the courageous efforts of those who bear the burdens of parenting alone and embrace the principle that all americans should be treated with dignity and respect. but respect is not enough. our laws and our government's regulations should recognize marriage as the union of one man and one woman and actively promote married family life as the basis of a stable and prosperous society. for that reason, as explained elsewhere in this platform, we do not accept the supreme court’s redefinition of marriage and we urge its reversal, whether through judicial reconsideration or a constitutional amendment returning control over marriage to the states. we oppose government discrimination against businesses or entities which decline to sell items or services to individuals for activities that go against their religious views about such activities. families formed or enlarged by adoption strengthen our communities and ennoble our nation. private entities which facilitate adoptions enrich our communities. we support measures such as the first amendment defense act to ensure these entities do not face government discrimination because of their views on marriage and family. we applaud the republican initiatives which have led to an increase in adoptions, an achievement which should be recognized in any restructuring of the federal tax code. while the number of children in foster care has stabilized, teens who age out of that setting often are abruptly left to face the world on their own. we urge states and community groups to help these young adults become independent. thirty years ago, president reagan commissioned a special working group on the family to study how government at all levels could be more supportive of family life. we urge marriage penalties to be removed from the tax code and public assistance programs. we invite all who care about children to join us in this proposal to ensure that all federal programs, in the words of president kennedy, “stress the integrity and preservation of the family unit.” a culture of hope we have been fighting the war on poverty for years and poverty is winning. our social safety net — about separate means-tested programs costing over $ trillion every year — is designed to help people born into or falling into poverty. it rarely lifts them out. its apologists judge success by the amount of money spent to keep people in the system. that is a cruel measurement. republicans propose to evaluate a poverty program by whether it actually reduces poverty and increases the personal independence of its participants. the results are damning: intergenerational poverty has persisted and worsened since . this year marks another important anniversary; it has been years since the landmark republican welfare reform of broke away from the discredited great society model. by making welfare a benefit instead of an entitlement, it put millions of recipients on a transition from dependence to independence. welfare rolls declined by half as recipients and prospective recipients discovered a better way to reach their goals. best of all, about million children moved out of poverty. today that progress has been lost. defying the law as it was plainly written, the current administration has nullified any meaningful work requirement and made tanf a mockery of the name we gave it: temporary assistance for needy families. this decision ensures that those families will remain needy and cut off from the economic mainstream of american society. this is the progressive pathology: keeping people dependent so that government can redistribute income. the result is . million people on food stamps and million on medicaid, plus another . million in the children’s health insurance program. this is the false compassion of the status quo. we propose instead the dynamic compassion of work requirements in a growing economy, where opportunity takes the place of a hand-out, where true self-esteem can grow from the satisfaction of a job well done. we call for removal of structural impediments which progressives throw in the path of poor people: over-regulation of start-up enterprises, excessive licensing requirements, needless restrictions on formation of schools and day-care centers serving neighborhood families, and restrictions on providing public services in fields like transport and sanitation that close the opportunity door to all but a favored few. we will continue our fight for school choice until all parents can find good, safe schools for their children. to protect religious liberty we will ensure that faith-based institutions, especially those that are vital parts of underserved neighborhoods, do not face discrimination by government. we propose new partnerships between those who manage federal programs and those who are on the front lines of fighting poverty on the ground. we must encourage their efforts to reclaim their communities from the culture of poverty. to advance this process, we urge greater state and local responsibility for, and control over, public assistance programs. education: a chance for every child education is much more than schooling. it is the whole range of activities by which families and communities transmit to a younger generation, not just knowledge and skills, but ethical and behavioral norms and traditions. it is the handing over of a cultural identity. that is why american education has, for the last several decades, been the focus of constant controversy, as centralizing forces from outside the family and community have sought to remake education in order to remake america. they have done immense damage. the federal government should not be a partner in that effort, as the constitution gives it no role in education. at the heart of the american experiment lies the greatest political expression of human dignity: the self- evident truth that ""all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” that truth rejects the dark view of the individual as human capital — a possession for the creation of another's wealth. parents are a child's first and foremost educators, and have primary responsibility for the education of their children. parents have a right to direct their children's education, care, and upbringing. we support a constitutional amendment to protect that right from interference by states, the federal government, or international bodies such as the united nations. we reject a one- size-fits-all approach to education and support a broad range of choices for parents and children at the state and local level. we likewise repeat our longstanding opposition to the imposition of national standards and assessments, encourage the parents and educators who are implementing alternatives to common core, and congratulate the states which have successfully repealed it. their education reform movement calls for choice-based, parent-driven accountability at every stage of schooling. it affirms higher expectations for all students and rejects the crippling bigotry of low expectations. it recognizes the wisdom of local control of our schools and it wisely sees consumer rights in education — choice — as the most important driving force for renewing education. it rejects excessive testing and ""teaching to the test” and supports the need for strong assessments to serve as a tool so teachers can tailor teaching to meet student needs. we applaud america’s great teachers, who should be protected against frivolous lawsuits and should be able to take reasonable actions to maintain discipline and order in the classroom. administrators need flexibility to innovate and to hold accountable all those responsible for student performance. a good understanding of the bible being indispensable for the development of an educated citizenry, we encourage state legislatures to offer the bible in a literature curriculum as an elective in america’s high schools. we urge school districts to make use of teaching talent in the business community, stem fields, and the military, especially among our returning veterans. rigid tenure systems should be replaced with a merit-based approach in order to attract the best talent to the classroom. all personnel who interact with school children should pass background checks and be held to the highest standards of personal conduct. academic excellence for all maintaining american preeminence requires a world-class system of education in which all students can reach their potential. republicans are leading the effort to create it. since , the federal government, through more than programs in the department of education, has spent $ trillion on elementary and secondary education with little substantial improvement in academic achievement or high school graduation rates. the united states spends an average of more than $, per pupil per year in public schools, for a total of more than $ billion. that represents more than percent of gdp devoted to k- education in -. of that amount, federal spending amounted to more than $ billion. clearly, if money were the solution, our schools would be problem-free. more money alone does not necessarily equal better performance. after years of trial and error, we know the policies and methods that have actually made a difference in student advancement: choice in education; building on the basics; stem subjects and phonics; career and technical education; ending social promotions; merit pay for good teachers; classroom discipline; parental involvement; and strong leadership by principals, superintendents, and locally elected school boards. because technology has become an essential tool of learning, it must be a key element in our efforts to provide every child equal access and opportunity. we strongly encourage instruction in american history and civics by using the original documents of our founding fathers. choice in education we support options for learning, including home-schooling, career and technical education, private or parochial schools, magnet schools, charter schools, online learning, and early-college high schools. we especially support the innovative financing mechanisms that make options available to all children: education savings accounts (esas), vouchers, and tuition tax credits. empowering families to access the learning environments that will best help their children to realize their full potential is one of the greatest civil rights challenges of our time. a young person’s ability to succeed in school must be based on his or her god-given talent and motivation, not an address, zip code, or economic status. we propose that the bulk of federal money through title i for low-income children and through idea for children with special needs should follow the child to whatever school the family thinks will work best for them. in sum, on the one hand enormous amounts of money are being spent for k- public education with overall results that do not justify that spending level. on the other hand, the common experience of families, teachers, and administrators forms the basis of what does work in education. in congress and in the states, republicans are bridging the gap between those two realities. congressional republicans are leading the way forward with major reform legislation advancing the concept of block grants and repealing numerous federal regulations which have interfered with state and local control of public schools. their workplace innovation and opportunity act — modernizing workforce programs, repealing mandates, and advancing employment for persons with disabilities — is now law. their legislation to require transparency in unfunded mandates imposed upon our schools is advancing. their d.c. opportunity scholarship program should be expanded as a model for the rest of the country. we deplore the efforts of congressional democrats and the current president to eliminate this successful program for disadvantaged students in order to placate the leaders of the teachers’ unions. to ensure that all students have access to the mainstream of american life, we support the english first approach and oppose divisive programs that limit students’ ability to advance in american society. we renew our call for replacing “family planning” programs for teens with sexual risk avoidance education that sets abstinence until marriage as the responsible and respected standard of behavior. that approach — the only one always effective against premarital pregnancy and sexually-transmitted disease — empowers teens to achieve optimal health outcomes. we oppose school-based clinics that provide referral or counseling for abortion and contraception and believe that federal funds should not be used in mandatory or universal mental health, psychiatric, or socio-emotional screening programs. the federal government has pushed states to collect and share vast amounts of personal student and family data, including the collection of social and emotional data. much of this data is collected without parental consent or notice. this is wholly incompatible with the american experiment and our inalienable rights. title ix we emphatically support the original, authentic meaning of title ix of the education amendments of . it affirmed that “no person in the united states shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.” that language opened up for girls and women a world of opportunities that had too often been denied to them. that same provision of law is now being used by bureaucrats — and by the current president of the united states — to impose a social and cultural revolution upon the american people by wrongly redefining sex discrimination to include sexual orientation or other categories. their agenda has nothing to do with individual rights; it has everything to do with power. they are determined to reshape our schools — and our entire society — to fit the mold of an ideology alien to america's history and traditions. their edict to the states concerning restrooms, locker rooms, and other facilities is at once illegal, dangerous, and ignores privacy issues. we salute the several states which have filed suit against it. sexual assault is a terrible crime. we commend the good-faith efforts by law enforcement, educational institutions, and their partners to address that crime responsibly. whenever reported, it must be promptly investigated by civil authorities and prosecuted in a courtroom, not a faculty lounge. questions of guilt or innocence must be decided by a judge and jury, with guilt determined beyond a reasonable doubt. those convicted of sexual assault should be punished to the full extent of the law. the administration's distortion of title ix to micromanage the way colleges and universities deal with allegations of abuse contravenes our country's legal traditions and must be halted before it further muddles this complex issue and prevents the proper authorities from investigating and prosecuting sexual assault effectively with due process. improving higher education our colleges, universities, and trade schools, large and small, public and private, form the world's greatest assemblage of learning. they drive much of the research that keeps america competitive and, by admitting large numbers of foreign students, convey our values and culture to the world. their excellence is undermined by an ideological bias deeply entrenched within the current university system. whatever the solution may be in private institutions, in state schools the trustees have a responsibility to the taxpayers to ensure that their enormous investment is not abused for political indoctrination. we call on state officials to preserve our public colleges, universities, and trade schools as places of learning and the exchange of ideas, not zones of intellectual intolerance or “safe zones,” as if college students need protection from the free exchange of ideas. a student's first amendment rights do not end at the schoolhouse gates. colleges, universities, and trade schools must not infringe on their freedom of speech and association in the name of political correctness. we condemn the campus-based bds (boycott, divestment, and sanctions) campaign against israel. it is antisemitism and should be denounced by advocates of academic freedom. college costs the cost of a college education has long been on an unsustainable trajectory, rising year by year far ahead of inflation. nationwide, student debt now exceeds credit card debt with average debt levels per student totaling roughly $,. delinquency rates on student loans are now as high as they were on subprime mortgages during the housing crisis. over half of recent college grads are unemployed or underemployed, working at jobs for which their expensive educations gave them no preparation. we need new systems of learning to compete with traditional four-year schools: technical institutions, online universities, life-long learning, and work- based learning in the private sector. public policy should advance their affordability, innovation, and transparency and should recognize that a four-year degree from a brick-and-mortar institution is not the only path toward a prosperous and fulfilling career. the federal government should not be in the business of originating student loans. in order to bring down college costs and give students access to a multitude of financing options, private sector participation in student financing should be restored. any regulation that increases college costs must be challenged to balance its worth against its negative economic impact on students and their families. in order to encourage new modes of higher education delivery to enter the market, accreditation should be decoupled from federal financing, and states should be empowered to allow a wide array of accrediting and credentialing bodies to operate. this model would foster innovation, bring private industry into the credentialing market, and give students the ability to customize their college experience. restoring patient control and preserving quality in healthcare any honest agenda for improving healthcare must start with repeal of the dishonestly named affordable care act of : obamacare. it weighs like the dead hand of the past upon american medicine. it imposed a euro-style bureaucracy to manage its unworkable, budget-busting, conflicting provisions. it has driven up prices for all consumers. their insurance premiums have dramatically increased while their deductibles have risen about eight times faster than wages in the last ten years. it drove up drug prices by levying a $ billion tax on manufacturers and importers and, through mandated price cuts for drugs under medicare and medicaid, forced pharmaceutical companies to raise prices for everyone else. its ""silver plans,” the most common option on the government insurance exchanges, limit people’s access to their own doctor through narrow networks and restrict drug coverage, forcing many patients to pay for extremely costly medicines for their chronic diseases. we agree with the four dissenting judges of the supreme court: “in our view, the entire act before us is invalid in its entirety.” it must be removed and replaced with an approach based on genuine competition, patient choice, excellent care, wellness, and timely access to treatment. to that end, a republican president, on the first day in office, will use legitimate waiver authority under the law to halt its advance and then, with the unanimous support of congressional republicans, will sign its repeal. the supreme court upheld obamacare based on congress’ power to tax. it is time to repeal obamacare and give america a much-needed tax cut. in its place we must combine what worked best in the past with changes needed for the future. we must recover the traditional patient-physician relationship based on mutual trust, informed consent, and confidentiality. to simplify the system for both patients and providers, we will reduce mandates and enable insurers and providers of care to increase healthcare options and contain costs. our goal is to ensure that all americans have improved access to affordable, high-quality healthcare, including those struggling with mental illness. we will return to the states their historic role of regulating local insurance markets, limit federal requirements on both private insurance and medicaid, and call on state officials to reconsider the costly medical mandates, imposed under their own laws, that price millions of low-income families out of the insurance market. to guarantee first-rate care for the needy, we propose to block grant medicaid and other payments and to assist all patients, including those with pre-existing conditions, to obtain coverage in a robust consumer market. through obamacare, the current administration has promoted the notion of abortion as healthcare. we, however, affirm the dignity of women by protecting the sanctity of human life. numerous studies have shown that abortion endangers the health and wellbeing of women, and we stand firmly against it. to ensure vigorous competition in healthcare, and because cost-awareness is the best guard against over-utilization, we will promote price transparency so consumers can know the cost of treatments before they agree to them. we will empower individuals and small businesses to form purchasing pools in order to expand coverage to the uninsured. we believe that individuals with preexisting conditions who maintain continuous coverage should be protected from discrimination. we applaud the advance of technology in electronic medical records while affirming patient privacy and ownership of personal health information. consumer choice is the most powerful factor in healthcare reform. today’s highly mobile workforce needs portability of insurance coverage that can go with them from job to job. the need to maintain coverage should not dictate where families have to live and work. we propose to end tax discrimination against the individual purchase of insurance and allow consumers to buy insurance across state lines. in light of that, we propose repealing the mccarran-ferguson act which protects insurance companies from anti-trust litigation. we look to the growth of health savings accounts and health reimbursement accounts that empower patients and advance choice in healthcare. our aging population must have access to safe and affordable care. because most seniors desire to age at home, we will make homecare a priority in public policy and will implement programs to protect against elder abuse. protecting individual conscience in healthcare america's healthcare professionals should not be forced to choose between following their faith and practicing their profession. we respect the rights of conscience of healthcare professionals, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and organizations, especially the faith-based groups which provide a major portion of care for the nation and the needy. we support the ability of all organizations to provide, purchase, or enroll in healthcare coverage consistent with their religious, moral, or ethical convictions without discrimination or penalty. we support the right of parents to determine the proper medical treatment and therapy for their minor children. we support the right of parents to consent to medical treatment for their minor children and urge enactment of legislation that would require parental consent for their daughter to be transported across state lines for abortion. providers should not be permitted to unilaterally withhold services because a patient's life is deemed not worth living. american taxpayers should not be forced to fund abortion. as democrats abandon this four decade-old bipartisan consensus, we call for codification of the hyde amendment and its application across the government, including obamacare. we call for a permanent ban on federal funding and subsidies for abortion and healthcare plans that include abortion coverage. better care and lower costs: tort reform medical malpractice lawsuits have ballooned the cost of healthcare for everyone by forcing physicians to practice defensive medicine through tests and treatments which otherwise might be optional. rural america is especially affected as obstetricians, surgeons, and other providers move to urban settings or retire in the face of escalating insurance premiums. many republican governors have advanced the legal reforms necessary to reverse that trend. we support state and federal legislation to cap non-economic damages in medical malpractice lawsuits, thereby relieving conscientious providers of burdens that are not rightly theirs and addressing a serious cause of higher medical bills. advancing research and development in healthcare american medicine is poised to enter a new era of technological advance. federal and private investment in basic and applied biomedical research holds enormous promise, especially with diseases and disorders like autism, alzheimer's, and parkinson's. just as we today take for granted wonders that seemed impossible a few decades ago mris and cat scans, robotic surgery, and in utero treatment — patients a decade hence will have care and treatment that will make much of today's medicine look primitive. modern miracles involving genetics, the immune system, cures for deadly diseases, and more are in the research pipeline. this is the consequence of marrying significant investment, both public and private, with the world's best talent, a formula that has for a century given the american people the world's best healthcare. we are determined that it should continue to do so, especially as we confront new dangers like ebola, zika, chikungunya, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens. to continue our headway against breast and prostate cancer, diabetes, and other killers, research must consider the needs of formerly neglected demographic groups. we call for expanded support for the stem cell research that now offers the greatest hope for many afflictions through adult stem cells, umbilical cord blood, and cells reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells — without the destruction of embryonic human life. we urge a ban on human cloning for research or reproduction, and a ban on the creation of, or experimentation on, human embryos for research. we applaud congress’ ban on the fda approval of research involving three-parent embryos. we believe the fda’s approval of mifeprex, a dangerous abortifacient formerly known as ru-, threatens women’s health, as does the agency’s endorsement of over-the-counter sales of powerful contraceptives without a physician’s recommendation. we support cutting federal and state funding for entities that endanger women’s health by performing abortions in a manner inconsistent with federal or state law. putting patients first: reforming the fda the united states has led life sciences and medical innovation for decades, bringing millions of high-paying jobs to our country and helping americans and people around the world live longer, healthier lives. unfortunately, the continuously increasing burden of governmental regulation and red tape is taking its toll on our innovative companies, and their pipeline of new life-saving devices and drugs to our nation’s patients is slowing and diminishing. the fda has slowly but relentlessly changed into an agency that more and more puts the public health at risk by delaying, chilling, and killing the development of new devices, drugs and biologics that can promote our lives and our health. the fda needs leadership that can reform the agency for our century and fix the lack of predictability, consistency, transparency and efficiency at the agency. the fda needs to return to its traditional emphasis on hard science and approving new breakthrough medicines, rather than divert its attention and consume its resources trying to overregulate electronic health records or vaping. we pledge to restore the fda to its position as the premier scientific health agency, focused on both promoting and protecting the public health in equal measure, so we can ensure that americans live longer, healthier lives, that the united states remains the world leader in life sciences and medical innovation, that millions of high-paying, cutting-edge device and drug jobs stay in the united states, that u.s. patients benefit first and most from new devices and drugs, and that the fda no longer wastes u.s. taxpayer and innovators’ resources through bureaucratic red tape and legal uncertainty. we commend those states that have passed right to try legislation, allowing terminally ill patients the right to try investigational medicines not yet approved by the fda. we urge congress to pass federal legislation to give all americans with terminal illnesses the right to try. advancing americans with disabilities under the last two republican presidents, landmark civil rights legislation affirmed the inherent rights of persons with disabilities. republicans want to support those rights by guaranteeing access to education and the tools necessary to compete in the mainstream of society. this is not just a moral obligation to our fellow americans with disabilities. it is our duty to our country’s future to tap this vast pool of talented individuals who want to work and contribute to the common good. for that reason, republican leadership led to enactment of the able act (achieving a better life experience) and the steve gleason act. the former, for the first time, lets people with disabilities maintain access to services while saving to develop assets. the latter, bearing the name of the former nfl player with als, provides access to speech-generating devices. in addition, our workforce innovation and opportunity act will make it easier for students with disabilities to pursue competitive employment. persons with disabilities are nearly twice as likely to be self-employed as the general population. to encourage their entrepreneurship, it makes sense to include them in the small business administration’s (a) certification program, which opens up federal contracting for emerging businesses. any restructuring of the tax code should consider ways in which companies can benefit from the talent and energy of their disabled employees. the individuals with disabilities education act (idea) has opened up unprecedented opportunities for many students. congressional republicans will lead in its reauthorization, as well as renewal of the higher education act, which can offer students with disabilities increased access to the general curriculum. our time act (transition to integrated and meaningful employment) will modernize the fair labor standards act to encourage competitive employment for persons with disabilities. we affirm our support for its goal of minimizing the separation of children with disabilities from their peers. we endorse efforts like employment first that replace dependency with jobs in the mainstream of the american workforce. we oppose the non-consensual withholding of care or treatment from people with disabilities, including newborns, the elderly, and infirm, just as we oppose euthanasia and assisted suicide, which endanger especially those on the margins of society. we urge the drug enforcement administration to restore its ban on the use of controlled substances for physician-assisted suicide. ensuring safe neighborhoods: criminal justice and prison reform the men and women of law enforcement — whether patrolling our neighborhoods or our borders, fighting organized crime or guarding against domestic terror — deserve our gratitude and support. their jobs are never easy, especially in crisis situations, and should not be made more difficult by politicized second-guessing from federal officials. the current administration’s lack of respect for them, from white house intervention in local arrests to the attorney general’s present campaign of harassment against police forces around the country, has been unprecedented. with all americans, we mourn those whom we have lost to violence and hatred. to honor their sacrifice, we recommit ourselves, as individuals and as a party, to the rule of law and the pursuit of justice. the conduct of the department of justice has included refusal to enforce laws, stonewalling congressional committees, destroying evidence, reckless dealing with firearms that led to several deaths on both sides of our border, and defying a citation for contempt. it has urged leniency for rioters while turning a blind eye to mob attacks on peaceful citizens exercising their political rights. a new administration must ensure the immediate dismissal and, where appropriate, prosecution of any department officials who have violated their oath of office. the next president must restore the public’s trust in law enforcement and civil order by first adhering to the rule of law himself. additionally, the next president must not sow seeds of division and distrust between the police and the people they have sworn to serve and protect. the republican party, a party of law and order, must make clear in words and action that every human life matters. two grave problems undermine the rule of law on the federal level: over-criminalization and over-federalization. in the first case, congress and federal agencies have increased the number of criminal offenses in the u.s. code from , in the early 1980s to more than , today. that does not include an estimated , regulations containing criminal penalties. no one, including the department of justice, can come up with accurate numbers. that recklessness is bad enough when committed by congress, but when it comes from the unelected bureaucrats of the federal agencies, it is intolerable. the power of career civil servants and political appointees to criminalize behavior is one of the worst violations of constitutional order perpetrated by the administrative state. to deal with this morass, we urge caution in the creation of new “crimes” and a bipartisan presidential commission to purge the code and the body of regulations of old “crimes.” we call for mens rea elements in the definition of any new crimes to protect americans who, in violating a law, act unknowingly or without criminal intent. we urge congress to codify the common law's rule of lenity, which requires courts to interpret unclear statutes in favor of a defendant. the over-federalization of criminal justice is one of many ways in which the government in washington has intruded beyond its proper jurisdiction. the essential role of federal law enforcement personnel in protecting federal property and combating interstate crime should not be compromised by diversion to matters properly handled by state and local authorities. we applaud the republican governors and legislators who have been implementing criminal justice reforms like those proposed by our platform. along with diversion of first-time, nonviolent offenders to community sentencing, accountability courts, drug courts, veterans treatment courts, and guidance by faith- based institutions with proven track records of rehabilitation, our platform emphasized restorative justice to make the victim whole and put the offender on the right path. as variants of these reforms are undertaken in many states, we urge the congress to learn from what works. in the past, judicial discretion about sentences led to serious mistakes concerning dangerous criminals. mandatory minimum sentencing became an important tool for keeping them off the streets. modifications to it should be targeted toward particular categories, especially nonviolent offenders and persons with drug, alcohol, or mental health issues, and should require disclosure by the courts of any judicial departure from the state’s sentencing requirements. the constitutionality of the death penalty is firmly settled by its explicit mention in the fifth amendment. with the murder rate soaring in our great cities, we condemn the supreme court’s erosion of the right of the people to enact capital punishment in their states. in solidarity with those who protect us, we call for mandatory prison time for all assaults involving serious injury to law enforcement officers. we call on the congress to make the federal courts a model for the rest of the country in protecting the rights of victims and their families. they should be told all relevant information about their case, allowed to be present for its trial, assured a voice in sentencing and parole hearings, given access to social and legal services, and benefit from the crime victims fund established under president reagan for that sole purpose. public officials must regain control of their correctional institutions, some of which have become ethnic and racial battlegrounds. persons jailed for whatever cause should be protected against cruel or degrading treatment by other inmates. courts should not tie the hands of prison officials in dealing with these problems. we encourage states to offer opportunities for literacy and vocational education to prepare prisoners for release to the community. breaking the cycle of crime begins with the children of those who are prisoners. deprived of a parent through no fault of their own, youngsters from these families should be a special concern of our schools, social services, and religious institutions. the internet must not become a safe haven for predators. pornography, with its harmful effects, especially on children, has become a public health crisis that is destroying the lives of millions. we encourage states to continue to fight this public menace and pledge our commitment to children’s safety and well-being. we applaud the social networking sites that bar sex offenders from participation. we urge energetic prosecution of child pornography, which is closely linked to human trafficking. combatting drug abuse the progress made over the last three decades against drug abuse is eroding, whether for cultural reasons or for lack of national leadership. in many jurisdictions, marijuana is virtually legalized despite its illegality under federal law. at the other end of the drug spectrum, heroin use nearly doubled from to , while deaths from heroin have quadrupled. all this highlights the continuing conflicts and contradictions in public attitudes and public policy toward illegal substances. congress and a new administration should consider the long- range implications of these trends for public health and safety and prepare to deal with the problematic consequences. the misuse of prescription painkillers - opioids — is a related problem. heroin and opioid abuse touches our communities, our homes, and our families in ways that have grave effects on americans in every community. with a quadrupling of both their sales and their overdose deaths, the opioid crisis is ravaging communities all over the country, often hitting rural areas harder than urban. because over-prescription of drugs is such a large part of the problem, republican legislation now allows medicare part d and medicare advantage plans to limit patients to a single pharmacy. congressional republicans have also called upon the centers for medicare and medicaid services to ensure that no physician will be penalized for limiting opioid prescriptions. we look for expeditious agreement between the house and senate on the comprehensive addiction and recovery act, which addresses the opioid epidemic from both the demand and supply sides of the problem. america resurgent a dangerous world alexander hamilton wrote in federalist that the first of the “principal” constitutional obligations of the federal government is to provide for the “common defense” of the united states, and president george washington wisely reminded us that “to be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.” after nearly eight years of a democratic commander-in-chief who has frequently placed strategic and ideological limitations and shackles on our military, our enemies have been emboldened and our national security is at great risk. our country faces a national security crisis, and only by electing a republican to the white house will we restore law and order to our land and safety to our citizens. we are the party of peace through strength. we believe that american exceptionalism — the notion that our ideas and principles as a nation give us a unique place of moral leadership in the world — requires the united states to retake its natural position as leader of the free world. tyranny and injustice thrive when america is weakened. the oppressed have no greater ally than a confident and determined united states, backed by the strongest military on the planet. quite simply, the republican party is committed to rebuilding the u.s. military into the strongest on earth, with vast superiority over any other nation or group of nations in the world. we face a dangerous world, and we believe in a resurgent america. in all of our country's history, there is no parallel to what president obama and his former secretary of state have done to weaken our nation. our aging naval capabilities are inadequate for their job. the air force fields the smallest and oldest force of combat aircraft in its history. the marines have only two-thirds the number of battalions they have historically needed to meet day to day operational demands. the army is at its lowest troop levels since before world war ii. our u.s. ambassador and american personnel were left without adequate security or backup halfway across the world in benghazi. in summary, we have returned to the hollow force days of jimmy carter. also neglected are our strategic forces, especially the development and deployment of ballistic missile defenses. the ground-based midcourse defense system has been delayed and underfunded. to curry favor with russia, defense installations in poland and the czech republic have been neutralized and the number of planned interceptors in alaska has been reduced. a new start agreement (strategic arms reduction treaty), so weak in verification and definitions that it is virtually impossible to prove a violation, has allowed russia to build up its nuclear arsenal while reducing ours. meanwhile moscow has repeatedly violated the intermediate-range nuclear forces (inf) treaty (a treaty agreeing to the elimination of land-based mid-range nuclear missiles) with impunity, covertly testing missiles banned under that agreement. in the international arena, a weak administration has invited aggression. the results of the administration's unilateral approach to disarmament are already clear: an emboldened china in the south china sea, a resurgent russia occupying parts of ukraine and threatening neighbors from the baltic to the caucasus, and an aggressive islamist terror network in the middle east. we support maintaining and, if warranted, increasing sanctions, together with our allies, against russia unless and until ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are fully restored. we also support providing appropriate assistance to the armed forces of ukraine and greater coordination with nato defense planning. all our adversaries heard the message in the administration’s cutbacks: america is weaker and retreating. concomitantly, we honor, support, and thank all law enforcement, first responders, and emergency personnel for their service. confronting the dangers in the face of these threats, the first order of business for a republican president and congress will be to restore our nation’s military might. republicans continue to support american military superiority which has been the cornerstone of a strategy that seeks to deter aggression or defeat those who threaten our vital national security interests. we must rebuild troop numbers and readiness and confirm their mission: protecting the nation, not nation building. the united states should meet the reagan model of “peace through strength” by a force that is capable of meeting any and all threats to our vital national security. we will no longer tolerate a president whose rules of engagement put our own troops in harm’s way or commanders who tell their soldiers that their first duty is to fight climate change. a republican administration will begin at once to undo the damage of the last eight years. we must move from a budget-based strategy to one that puts the security of our nation first. this means that our republican president’s strategic vision will include the development of a balanced force to meet the diverse threats facing our nation. special operations forces are simply not intended to deal with the full spectrum of threats. we need a reagan-era force that can fight and win two-and one-half wars ranging from counterterrorism to deterring major power aggressors. we should abandon arms control treaties that benefit our adversaries without improving our national security. we must fund, develop, and deploy a multi-layered missile defense system. we must modernize nuclear weapons and their delivery platforms, end the policy of mutually assured destruction, and rebuild relationships with our allies, who understand that as long as the u.s. nuclear arsenal is their shield, they do not need to engage in nuclear proliferation. while immigration is addressed in more detail elsewhere, we cannot ignore the reality that border security is a national security issue, and that our nation’s immigration and refugee policies are placing americans at risk. to keep our people safe, we must secure our borders, enforce our immigration laws, and properly screen refugees and other immigrants entering from any country. in particular we must apply special scrutiny to those foreign nationals seeking to enter the united states from terror-sponsoring countries or from regions associated with islamic terrorism. this was done successfully after september , , under the national security entry-exit registration system, which should be renewed now. supporting our troops: resources to do their job we owe it to the american people and to those who fight our wars that we remain the strongest military on earth and be prepared to defeat any adversary under any circumstances on any battlefield, including land, air, sea, or cyber. successive years of cuts to our defense budget have put an undue strain on our men and women in uniform. this is especially harmful at a time when we are asking our military to do more in an increasingly dangerous world. the u.s. defense budget has suffered a percent cut in real dollars in the five years since sequestration. we support lifting the budget cap for defense and reject the efforts of democrats to hold the military’s budget hostage for their domestic agenda. congress and the administration should work together to approve military spending at the level necessary to defend our country. we must not be encumbered by decades- old, legacy procurement processes. america’s incredible talent and ingenuity must be unleashed by modernizing the military procurement system and embracing competition among traditional and non-traditional suppliers. competitive acquisition and maintenance of weapon systems, including the sustainment and support of such systems, will benefit the u.s. economy, u.s. taxpayers, and most important, the american warfighter. increased competition will enable new department of defense suppliers, particularly small businesses, to participate in the defense sector. that will promote new demand for skilled-labor jobs, while making the department's procurement more cost-efficient. the increased agility and effectiveness will ensure that our troops are equipped with the right resources more quickly than our current procurement systems allow. supporting our troops: standing by our heroes with republican leadership, the congress recently passed legislation that begins to reverse america's military decline. the national defense authorization act of begins to correct the shortfalls in our military readiness by reversing troop cuts, increasing investments in training and maintenance, and rebuilding facilities. it gives our troops the full pay raise to which they are entitled under the law and gives the next administration the ability to review operations and funding, make adjustments, and ask for more money if necessary. all this represents a sound start in supporting those who put their lives on the line in defense of our country, while protecting our national security in a dangerous world. military families must be assured of the pay, healthcare, housing, education, and overall support they have earned. in recent years, they have been carrying the burden of budgetary restraint more than any other americans through cuts in their pay, health benefits, and retirement plans. about percent of enlistees come from military families. we cannot expect that level of patriotic commitment to continue among young people who have experienced the way their families have been treated. we must ensure that the nation keeps its commitments to those who signed on the dotted line of enlistment. the repeated troop deployments during conflicts in the middle east have been unusually hard on all members of their households, worsening unemployment and underemployment among spouses. in many cases, they and their children have been at war for years. we must strengthen existing programs that offer families readjustment information and counseling, and we urge states to help by providing job programs, license reciprocity, one-stop service centers, and education. the burden of our country's extended military involvement in the middle east has taken a toll on our service personnel. suicides among our military — active duty troops, reservists, national guardsmen, and veterans — are at shocking levels, while postservice medical conditions, including addiction and mental illness, require more and more assistance. more than ever, our government must work with the private sector to advance opportunities and provide assistance to those wounded in spirit as well as in body, whether through experimental efforts like the paws (puppies assisting wounded servicemen) program for service dogs or through the faith-based institutions that have traditionally been providers of counseling and aid. we support the rights of conscience of military chaplains of all faiths to practice their faith free from political interference. we reject attempts by the obama administration to censure and silence them, particularly christians and christian chaplains. we support an increase in the size of the chaplain corps. a republican commander-in- chief will protect the religious freedom of all military members, especially chaplains, and will not tolerate attempts to ban bibles or religious symbols from military facilities. a republican commander-in- chief will also encourage education regarding the religious liberties of military personnel under both the first amendment of the u.s. constitution and the current national defense authorization act. our country's all-volunteer force has been a success. we oppose the reinstatement of the draft, except in dire circumstances like world war, whether directly or through compulsory national service. we support the all-volunteer force and oppose unnecessary policy changes, including compulsory national service and selective service registration of women for a possible future draft. we reiterate our support for both the advancement of women in the military and their exemption from direct ground combat units and infantry battalions. we affirm the cultural values that encourage selfless service and superiority in battle, and we oppose anything which might divide or weaken team cohesion, including intra-military special interest demonstrations. in particular, we warn against modification or lessening of standards in order to satisfy a nonmilitary agenda imposed by the white house. we call for an objective review of the impact on readiness of the current administration’s ideology- based personnel policies, and will correct problems with appropriate administrative, legal, or legislative action. we reject the use of the military as a platform for social experimentation and will not accept or continue attempts to undermine military priorities and mission readiness. we believe that our nation is most secure when the president and the administration prioritize readiness, recruitment, and retention rather than using the military to advance a social or political agenda. military readiness should not be sacrificed on the altar of political correctness. we oppose legislative attempts to modify the system of military justice that would undermine its fairness and due process rights for all concerned, both the accuser and the accused. citizen soldiers: national guard and reserves our reserve and national guard forces are national assets that must be nurtured in a manner commensurate with their role as america’s sentinels. their historic mission as citizen-soldiers is a proud tradition linking every town and city across america to liberty’s cause. since september , , the national guard has transformed from a strategic reserve to a fully integrated operational fighting force. the guard has bled on missions in iraq, afghanistan, the balkans, and the sinai. today, more than fifty percent of our guardsmen have combat experience. the guard has demonstrated its value to the nation not only in war but during emergencies here at home such as hurricane katrina and super storm sandy. to avoid the overextension of our military, we support a larger active force and oppose the current administration’s cuts to the national guard and reserves. those reductions are dangerous and counter-productive because the men and women of the guard and reserve tend to be older and more experienced than their active duty counterparts. guard and reserve forces are currently deployed at historically high rates. the army reserve alone has soldiers in countries. to its credit, the republican congress, by passing the national defense authorization act, has moved to ensure these troops have what they need. that provision has triggered another veto threat from the commander- in-chief, even though the bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in both the house and senate. he would have the members of the reserve and guard train on, and potentially be deployed with, equipment that is no longer used by their active duty comrades. we cannot tolerate this endangerment of both our troops and our national security. therefore, we recommend a permanent line item for national guard affairs, one that is not eliminated by the president and reinstated by congress. the guard is too essential to our national defense to be a secondary decision. honoring and supporting our veterans: a sacred obligation our nation’s veterans have been our nation’s strength and remain a national resource. their service to their country — as community leaders, volunteers, mentors, educators, problem solvers, and public officials — continues long after they leave the military. in the same way, our obligation to the one percent who defend the other ninety- nine percent does not end when they take off the uniform. america has a sacred trust with our veterans, and we are committed to ensuring them and their families' care and dignity. the work of the department of veterans affairs (va) is essential to meet our commitments to them: providing health, education, disability, survivor, and home loan benefits, and arranging memorial services upon death. we heed abraham lincoln's command “to care for him who bore the battle.” to care, as well, for the families of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, who must be assured of meaningful financial assistance, remains our solemn duty. as shown by recent controversies at the department, senior leaders must be held accountable for ensuring that their subordinates are more responsive to veterans' needs. the va has failed those who have sacrificed the most for our freedom. the va must move from a sometimes adversarial stance to an advocacy relationship with vets. to that end, we will empower the secretary to hold all va employees accountable and will seek fundamental change in the va's senior leadership structure by placing presidential appointees, rather than careerists, in additional positions of significant responsibility. we cannot allow an unresponsive bureaucracy to blunt our national commitment. the va must strengthen and improve its efforts through partnerships with private enterprises, veteran service organizations, technology and innovation, and competitive bidding to enable the va to better provide both quality and timely care along with all earned benefits to our nation's veterans and their families. this will allow the va to reduce the backlog and save immense resources all at the same time. therefore, let us look to innovative solutions that allow higher quality va care, reduce backlogs, and save immense resources all at the same time. our wounded warriors, whether still in service or discharged, deserve the best medical care the country can provide. we must make military and veterans' medicine the gold standard for mental health, traumatic brain injury, multiple traumas, loss of limbs, and post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd). those injuries require a new commitment of targeted resources and personnel for treatment and care to advance recovery. that includes allowing veterans to choose to access care in the community and not just in va facilities, because the best care in the world is not effective if it is not accessible. we will seek to consolidate the va's existing community care authorities to make a single program that will be easily understood by both veterans and va healthcare providers. like the rest of american medicine, the va faces a critical shortage of primary care and mental health physicians. that's why there are long waiting times to see a doctor and why doctors are often frustrated by the limited time they have with their patients. this is especially the case with mental health care, which often amounts to prescribing drugs because there are not enough psychologists and psychiatrists to do anything else. inadequate treatment of ptsd drives other problems like suicide, homelessness, and unemployment. this situation may not be quickly reversed, but a republican administration will begin, on day one, to undertake the job. as a nation, we honor the sacrifice of our fallen service members at the graves where we lay them to rest in national, state, and veterans' cemeteries around the world. in doing so, we make it clear that their ultimate sacrifice and service to our country will never be forgotten. as a party, we seek to honor their sacrifice and comfort their families by ensuring all veterans' cemeteries are adequately equipped and a standard of care established, using arlington cemetery as a guide, that is befitting their service. the level of financial distress and homelessness among vets is a shame to the nation. for a veteran, a job is more than a source of income. it is a new mission, with a new status, and the transition can be difficult. we urge the private sector to make hiring vets a company policy and commend the organizations that have proven programs to accomplish this. we will retain the preference given to veterans when they seek federal employment. we urge closer coordination with the state offices for veterans' affairs, particularly with regard to expediting disability claims, since those closest to an individual can often best diagnose a problem and apply a remedy. we will halt the current administration's unconstitutional automatic denial of gun ownership to returning members of our armed forces who have had representatives appointed to manage their financial affairs. we urge state education officials to promote the hiring of qualified veterans as teachers in our public schools. their proven abilities and life experiences will make them more successful instructors and role models for students than would any teaching certification. over-prescription of opioids has become a nationwide problem hindering the treatment of veterans suffering from mental health issues. we therefore support the need to explore new and broader ranges of options, including faith- based programs, that will better serve the veteran and reduce the need to rely on drugs as the sole treatment. america: the indispensable nation for the last several generations, our country’s two major political parties were dedicated to the nation’s security and the advance of freedom around the world. both had learned from mistakes of the past and realized that a weak america invited aggression. both recognized the need to stand with friends and oppose those who wished us evil. whatever their disagreements, both the republican and democratic parties stood for peace through strength — and strength meant american military superiority. this bipartisan commitment has tragically changed. the leadership of the democratic party, both those in office and those who seek it, no longer see america as a force for good in the world. they do not stand by allies or stand strong against our foes. they pander to world opinion and neglect the national interest. they cannot be trusted to advance either the cause of liberty or our national security in the dangerous years in which we live. we affirm our party’s tradition of world leadership established by president eisenhower and followed by every republican president since. it stands for enormous power — and the prudence to use it sparingly, precisely, and only in grave necessity. it stands for involvement, not intervention. it requires consultation, not permission to act. it leads from the front — and ensures all others do their parts as well. it embraces american exceptionalism and rejects the false prophets of decline and diminution. it is, in sum, the way we will lead the world into a new century of greater peace and prosperity — another american century. challenges of a changing middle east the middle east is more dangerous now than at any time since the second world war. whatever their disagreements, presidents of both parties had always prioritized america’s national interests, the trust of friendly governments, and the security of israel. that sound consensus was replaced with impotent grandstanding on the part of the current president and his secretaries of state. the results have been ruinous for all parties except islamic terrorists and their iranian and other sponsors. we consider the administration’s deal with iran, to lift international sanctions and make hundreds of billions of dollars available to the mullahs, a personal agreement between the president and his negotiating partners and non-binding on the next president. without a two-thirds endorsement by the senate, it does not have treaty status. because of it, the defiant and emboldened regime in tehran continues to sponsor terrorism across the region, develop a nuclear weapon, test-fire ballistic missiles inscribed with “death to israel,” and abuse the basic human rights of its citizens. a republican president will not be bound by it. we must retain all options in dealing with a situation that gravely threatens our security, our interests, and the survival of our friends. over the last four years we have seen the rise of a murderous fanaticism in the form of isis, the so called islamic state. its reach now extends far beyond the middle east to virtually every continent. isis has brought ancient butchery into the 21st century. nations are imploding, erasing long- established borders. the obama administration and its secretary of state so mishandled the arab spring that it destabilized the entire region. the hope some saw in the arab spring has transformed into disappointment. the dictator of syria, bashar assad, has murdered hundreds of thousands of his own people and created millions of refugees, and an american president has been unable to rally the world against him. understandably, our allies fear for their future in a region far more dangerous than it was eight years ago. a republican administration will restore our nation’s credibility. we must stand up for our friends, challenge our foes, and destroy isis. hezbollah, controlling over , missiles in lebanon, must be isolated and lebanon’s independence restored. we will support the transition to a post-assad syrian government that is representative of its people, protects the rights of all minorities and religions, respects the territorial integrity of its neighbors, and contributes to peace and stability in the region. the iraqi people have been on the front lines in the fight against terror. hundreds of thousands have been killed, and the attacks against them continue, even in baghdad. our partnership with them should continue as long as isis and others like it survive in the region. we are deeply concerned that, in the face of genocide against them, christian communities in cities like erbil are receiving no financial support from either the u.s. government or the un to help with displaced persons and urban refugees. their survival is sustained only by private charities. this must change immediately. defeating isis means more than pushing back its fighters while abandoning its victims. it must mean aiding those who have suffered the most — and doing so before they starve. it means supporting the long-term survival of indigenous religious and ethnic communities, punishing the perpetrators of crimes against humanity, and conditioning humanitarian and military assistance to governments on their observable commitment to human rights. we continue to support the kurdish people, whose bravery and cooperation with our forces merit our respect and their autonomy. many countries in the region have given, and continue to give, substantial assistance to the united states because they understand that our struggle against terrorism is not an ethnic or religious fight. they consider violent extremists to be abusers of their faith, not its champions. we applaud their courage and value their counsel. the u.s. government, together with its global partners, should mobilize its political, economic, and military assets to support the creation of a safe haven in northern iraq to protect those ethnic and religious minorities continuing to face genocide at the hands of isis. our unequivocal support for israel like the united states of america, the modern state of israel is a country born from the aspiration for freedom and stands out among the nations as a beacon of democracy and humanity. beyond our mutual strategic interests, israel is likewise an exceptional country that shares our most essential values. it is the only country in the middle east where freedom of speech and freedom of religion are found. therefore, support for israel is an expression of americanism, and it is the responsibility of our government to advance policies that reflect americans' strong desire for a relationship with no daylight between america and israel. we recognize jerusalem as the eternal and indivisible capital of the jewish state and call for the american embassy to be moved there in fulfillment of u.s. law. we reaffirm america's commitment to israel's security and will ensure that israel maintains a qualitative military edge over any and all adversaries. we support israel's right and obligation to defend itself against terror attacks upon its people and against alternative forms of warfare being waged upon it legally, economically, culturally, and otherwise. we reject the false notion that israel is an occupier and specifically recognize that the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement (bds) is anti-semitic in nature and seeks to destroy israel. therefore, we call for effective legislation to thwart actions that are intended to limit commercial relations with israel, or persons or entities doing business in israel or in israeli-controlled territories, in a discriminatory manner. the united states seeks to assist in the establishment of comprehensive and lasting peace in the middle east, to be negotiated among those living in the region. we oppose any measures intended to impose an agreement or to dictate borders or other terms, and we call for the immediate termination of all u.s. funding of any entity that attempts to do so. our party is proud to stand with israel now and always. u.s. leadership in the asian pacific we are a pacific nation with economic, military, and cultural ties to all the countries of the oceanic rim and treaty alliances with japan, south korea, australia, the philippines, and thailand. with them, we look toward the establishment of human rights for the people of north korea. we urge the government of china to recognize the inevitability of change in the kim family’s slave state and, for everyone’s safety against nuclear disaster, to hasten positive change on the korean peninsula. the united states will continue to demand the complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement of north korea’s nuclear weapons program with full accounting of its proliferation activities. we also pledge to counter any threats from the north korean regime. we salute the people of taiwan, with whom we share the values of democracy, human rights, a free market economy, and the rule of law. our relations will continue to be based upon the provisions of the taiwan relations act, and we affirm the six assurances given to taiwan in by president reagan. we oppose any unilateral steps by either side to alter the status quo in the taiwan straits on the principle that all issues regarding the island’s future must be resolved peacefully, through dialogue, and be agreeable to the people of taiwan. if china were to violate those principles, the united states, in accord with the taiwan relations act, will help taiwan defend itself. we praise efforts by the new government in taipei to continue constructive relations across the taiwan strait and call on china to reciprocate. as a loyal friend of america, taiwan has merited our strong support, including free trade agreement status, the timely sale of defensive arms including technology to build diesel submarines, and full participation in the world health organization, international civil aviation organization, and other multilateral institutions. china’s behavior has negated the optimistic language of our last platform concerning our future relations with china. the liberalizing policies of recent decades have been abruptly reversed, dissent brutally crushed, religious persecution heightened, the internet crippled, a barbaric population control two-child policy of forced abortions and forced sterilizations continued, and the cult of mao revived. critics of the regime have been kidnapped by its agents in foreign countries. to distract the populace from its increasing economic problems and, more importantly, to expand its military might, the government asserts a preposterous claim to the entire south china sea and continues to dredge ports and create landing fields in contested waters where none have existed before, ever nearer to u.s. territories and our allies, while building a navy far out of proportion to defensive purposes. the complacency of the obama regime has emboldened the chinese government and military to issue threats of intimidation throughout the south china sea, not to mention parading their new missile, ""the guam killer,” down the main streets of beijing, a direct shot at guam as america’s first line of defense. meanwhile, cultural genocide continues in tibet and xinjiang, the promised autonomy of hong kong is eroded, the currency is manipulated, our technology is stolen, and intellectual property and copyrights are mocked in an economy based on piracy. in business terms, this is not competition; it is a hostile takeover. for any american company to abet those offenses, especially governmental censorship and tracking of dissenters, is a disgrace. the return to maoism by china’s current rulers is not reason to disengage with the chinese people or their institutions. we welcome students, tourists, and investors, who can see for themselves our vibrant american democracy and how real democracy works. we caution, however, against academic or cultural operations under the control of the chinese government and call upon american colleges to dissociate themselves from this increasing threat to academic freedom and honest research. most of the nations of southeast asia have set aside crippling ideologies and sought material progress in free enterprise and democracy. we congratulate the people of burma on their emergence from authoritarian rule and urge their respect for the rights of their country’s minority populations. our improved relations with vietnam — including arms sales — must advance efforts to obtain an accounting for, and repatriation of the remains of, americans who gave their lives in the cause of vietnamese freedom. we cannot overlook the continued repression of fundamental rights and religious freedom, as well as retribution against ethnic minorities and others who assisted u.s. forces during the conflict there. india is our geopolitical ally and a strategic trading partner. the dynamism of its people and the endurance of their democratic institutions are earning their country a position of leadership not only in asia but throughout the world. we encourage the indian government to permit expanded foreign investment and trade, the key to rising living standards for those left out of their country's energetic economy. for all of india's religious communities, we urge protection against violence and discrimination. republicans note with pride the contributions to our country that are made by our fellow citizens of indian ancestry. conflicts in the middle east have created special political and military challenges for the people of pakistan. our working relationship is a necessary, though sometimes difficult, benefit to both, and we look toward the strengthening of historic ties that have frayed under the weight of international conflict. this process cannot progress as long as any citizen of pakistan can be punished for helping the war on terror. pakistanis, afghans, and americans have a common interest in ridding the region of the taliban and securing pakistan's nuclear arsenal. that goal has been undermined by the current administration's feckless treatment of troop commitments and blatant disregard of advice from commanders on the ground, particularly with regard to afghanistan. a republican president will work with all regional leaders to restore mutual trust while insisting upon progress against corruption and the narcotic trade that fuels insurgency. renewing the european alliance with bipartisan support, president truman forged the north atlantic treaty organization (nato) as an alliance of the western democracies. its continued effectiveness is vital, especially in light of recent military challenges in eastern europe. with the american people spending on defense, per capita, four times the amount spent by europeans, we demand, as we have in the past, that our fellow members of nato fulfill their commitments and meet their need for greater investment in their armed forces. our historic ties to the peoples of europe have been based on shared culture and values, common interests and goals. their endurance cannot be taken for granted, especially in light of the continent's economic problems and demographic changes. we recognize with regret the increasing trend among many of our allies to move away from rights and liberties that americans hold dear, especially freedom of speech. it would be a tragic irony if the nations of europe which withstood soviet repression were to now impose a form of it upon themselves. we honor our special relationship with the people of the united kingdom and are grateful for their staunch support in the fight against terrorism. we respect their decision concerning their nation's relationship to the european union and pledge that, however much other international relationships may change, those who were first to our side in our hour of loss will always rank first in our policies and our esteem. we thank the several nations of europe that have contributed to a united effort in iraq, afghanistan, and elsewhere. their support and sacrifice in the fight against islamic terrorism will not be forgotten. we applaud the ongoing reconciliation in northern ireland and hope that its success might be replicated in cyprus. we urge greater coordination in economic and security affairs between the united states and the republics of eastern europe. we urge that poland be granted visa waiver status and we support placement of nato troops in poland. for the people of russia, we affirm our respect and our determination to maintain a friendship beyond the reach of those who wish to divide us. we have common imperatives: ending terrorism, combating nuclear proliferation, promoting trade, and more. we also have a common problem: the continuing erosion of personal liberty and fundamental rights under the current officials in the kremlin. repressive at home and reckless abroad, their policies imperil the nations which regained their self-determination upon the collapse of the soviet union. we will meet the return of russian belligerence with the same resolve that led to the collapse of the soviet union. we will not accept any territorial change in eastern europe imposed by force, in ukraine, georgia, or elsewhere, and will use all appropriate constitutional measures to bring to justice the practitioners of aggression and assassination. we urge greater attention in u.s. diplomacy, trade, and strategic planning, to the nations of eurasia, formerly parts of the soviet empire. caught between their two authoritarian neighbors, their path toward democratic institutions has been uncertain. we urge our government and our allies to work toward the integration of the central asian republics into the global economy through foreign investment, which can bring with it market and political reforms and a firmer establishment of the rule of law. those developments will not only improve the living conditions throughout that vast area but are likely to reduce the lure of the radical ideologies that already threaten the region. family of the americas our future is intimately tied to the future of the americas. family, language, culture, environment, and trade link us closely with both canada and mexico. our relations with both of these friends will be based upon continuing cooperation and our mutually shared interests. our attention to trade and environmental issues will contribute to strong economic growth and prosperity throughout the americas. we thank our neighbors in mexico and canada who have been our partners in the fight against terrorism and the war on drugs. the mexican people deserve our assistance as they bravely resist the drug cartels that traffic in death on both sides of our border. their rich cultural and religious heritage, shared by many millions of our fellow citizens, should foster greater understanding and cooperation between our countries. our canadian neighbors can count on our cooperation and respect. to advance north america's energy independence, we intend to reverse the current administration's blocking of the keystone xl pipeline. apart from its economic value, that project has become a symbol in the contest between the public's desire for economic development and the government's hostility to growth. we stand with the people. we express our solidarity with all the peoples of the western hemisphere. their aspirations for economic betterment and political liberty have deserved better from our government than its policies of the last eight years. the current administration has abandoned america's friends and rewarded its enemies. a republican president will never embrace a marxist dictator, in venezuela or anywhere else. the current chief executive has allowed that country to become a narcoterrorist state, an iranian outpost threatening central america, and a safe haven for the agents of hezbollah. now, with their country ruined by socialism and on the verge of chaos, the venezuelan people are fighting to restore their democracy and regain their rights. when they triumph, as they surely will, the united states will stand ready to help them restore their country to the family of the americas. we affirm our friendship and admiration for the people of colombia and call on the republican congress to express its solidarity with their decades-long fight against the terrorist farc. their sacrifice and suffering must not be betrayed by the accession to power of murderers and drug lords. we want to welcome the people of cuba back into our hemispheric family — after their corrupt rulers are forced from power and brought to account for their crimes against humanity. we stand with the women in white and all the victims of the loathsome regime that clings to power in havana. we do not say this lightly: they have been betrayed by those who are currently in control of u.s. foreign policy. the current administration's “opening to cuba” was a shameful accommodation to the demands of its tyrants. it will only strengthen their military dictatorship. we call on the congress to uphold current u.s. law which sets conditions for the lifting of sanctions on the island: legalization of political parties, an independent media, and free and fair internationally-supervised elections. we call for a dedicated platform for the transmission of radio and tv marti and for the promotion of internet access and circumvention technology as tools to strength cuba's pro-democracy movement. we support the work of the commission for assistance to a free cuba and affirm the principles of the cuban adjustment act of , recognizing the rights of cubans fleeing communism. africa: the promise and the challenge we recognize africa’s extraordinary potential. both the united states and our many african allies will become stronger through investment, trade, and promotion of the democratic and free market principles that have brought prosperity around the world. we pledge to be the best partner of all african nations in their pursuit of economic freedom and human rights. the republican congress has extended to the african growth and opportunity act, and president george w. bush’s health initiatives — aids relief under pepfar and the global fund to fight aids, tuberculosis, and malaria — continue to save millions of lives. peace corps volunteers and u.s. seabees teach and build in villages that know firsthand our country’s idealism. we stand in solidarity with those african countries now under assault by the forces of radical islam: boko haram, al-shabaab, and others like them. their terror falls on both muslims and christians, on anyone who will not submit to their savage ideology. we urge governments throughout the continent to recognize this threat to their own people. we support closer cooperation in both military and economic matters with those on the front lines of civilization’s battle against the forces of evil. sovereign american leadership in international organizations there is no substitute for principled american leadership. since the end of world war ii, the united states, through the founding of the united nations and nato, has participated in a number of international organizations which can, but sometimes do not, serve the cause of peace and prosperity. while acting through them our country must always reserve the right to go its own way. we must not be silent about our country’s cause. that is why we have long supported our country’s international broadcasting to eastern europe, the middle east, and asia. our continued participation in the united nations should be contingent upon the enactment of long-overdue changes in the way that institution functions. american taxpayers, the chief funders of the u.n., deserve full transparency in the financial operations of its overpaid bureaucrats. we should no longer tolerate its managerial scandals, its human rights council composed of some of the world’s worst tyrants, and its treatment of israel as a pariah state. the u.n.’s population fund has, from its origin, been rooted in no-growth policies that limit economic development in the countries needing it most. its complicity in china’s barbaric program of forced abortion led president reagan to set a wall of separation — his mexico city policy, which prohibits the granting of federal monies to non-governmental organizations that provide or promote abortion. we affirm his position and, in light of plummeting birth rates around the world, suggest a reevaluation of the u.n.’s record on economic progress. precisely because we take our country’s treaty obligations seriously, we oppose ratification of international agreements whose long-range implications are ominous or unclear. we do not support the u.n. convention on women’s rights, the convention on the rights of the child, the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities, and the u.n. arms trade treaty, as well as various declarations from the u.n. conference on environment and development. because of our concern for american sovereignty, domestic management of our fisheries, and our country’s long-term energy needs, we have deep reservations about the regulatory, legal, and tax regimes inherent in the law of the sea treaty. we emphatically reject u.n. agenda as erosive of u.s. sovereignty, and we oppose any form of global tax. to shield members of our armed forces and others in service to america from ideological prosecutions overseas, the republican party does not accept the jurisdiction of the international criminal court. we support statutory protection for u.s. personnel and officials as they act abroad to meet our global security requirements, and we deplore the current inaction of the administration in that regard. our service members must be subject only to american law. defending international religious freedom the u.s. commission on international religious freedom, an initiative of congressional republicans, has been neglected by the current administration at a time when its voice more than ever needs to be heard. religious minorities across the middle east have been driven from their ancient homelands, and thousands, there and in africa, have been slaughtered for their faith in what the state department has, belatedly, labeled genocide. the united states must stand with leaders, like president sisi of egypt who has bravely protected the rights of coptic christians in egypt, and call on other leaders across the region to ensure that all religious minorities, whether yazidi, bahai, orthodox, catholic or protestant christians, are free to practice their religion without fear of persecution. at a time when china has renewed its destruction of churches, christian home-schooling parents are jailed in parts of europe, and even canada threatens pastors for their preaching, a republican administration will return the advocacy of religious liberty to a central place in its diplomacy, will quickly designate the systematic killing of religious and ethnic minorities a genocide, and will work with the leaders of other nations to condemn and combat genocidal acts. america’s generosity: international assistance that makes a difference foreign aid must serve america’s interests first. in today’s world of complex challenges, international assistance is a critical tool for advancing america’s security and economic interests by preventing conflict, building stability, opening markets for private investment, and responding to suffering and need with the compassion that is at the heart of our country’s values. a strong commitment to international development and diplomacy, alongside defense, was a key component of president reagan’s ""peace through strength” strategy. it can sometimes serve as an alternative means of keeping the peace, far less costly both in dollars and in human lives than military engagement. the millennium challenge corporation, spearheaded by the last republican administration, has established a new model of foreign assistance that helps ensure taxpayer dollars are spent on projects that are effective, results-driven, transparent, and accountable. we must embrace this model throughout our foreign assistance programs and efforts as a catalyst for private sector investment to combat corruption, strengthen the rule of law, and open new markets for american goods and services in a competitive global economy. foreign assistance programs must not only project the best of american values, but must work to create self-sustainability and leverage the resources and capacity of the private sector. even more important is the overseas assistance — billions of dollars and volunteer hours — provided by america’s foundations, educational institutions, faith-based groups, and charitable individuals. their essential role in international development should be weighed in any revision of the tax code. the advance of political freedom and entrepreneurial capitalism drives economic growth, catalyzes private sector development, and is the only sustainable solution to poverty. over the last years, the level of private investment overseas from the united states has eclipsed aid many times over. our development strategy must build on recent republican efforts to use foreign assistance to catalyze private sector investment and expertise in addressing global challenges that can build a more stable world and advance america’s national security and economic interests. the integrity of our country’s foreign assistance program has been compromised by the current administration’s attempt to impose on foreign recipients, especially the peoples of africa, its own radical social agenda while excluding faith-based groups — the sector with the best track record in promoting development — because they will not conform to that agenda. we pledge to reverse this course, encouraging more involvement by the most effective aid organizations and trusting developing peoples to build their futures through their own values. advancing human rights to those who stand in the darkness of tyranny, america has always been a beacon of hope, and so it must remain. radical islamic terrorism poses an existential threat to personal freedom and peace around the world. we oppose its brutal assault on all human beings, all of whom have inherent dignity. the republican party stands united with all victims of terrorism and will fight at home and abroad to destroy terrorist organizations and protect the lives and fundamental liberties of all people. republicans have led the way in promoting initiatives that have protected and rescued millions of the world’s most vulnerable and persecuted. standing up for repressed religious groups, prisoners of conscience, women trafficked into sexual slavery, and those suffering from disease or starvation is not just consistent with american values. it advances important security and economic interests as well. a republican administration will never say, as hillary clinton did as secretary of state in , that raising human rights concerns “can't interfere with the global economic crisis, the global climate change crisis, and the security crisis.” the united states needs a radical rethinking of our human rights diplomacy. a republican administration will adopt a “whole of government” approach to protect fundamental freedoms globally, one where pressing human rights and rule of law issues are integrated at every appropriate level of our bilateral relationships and strategic decisionmaking. republican policy will reflect the fact that the health of the u.s. economy and environment, the safety of our food and drug supplies, the security of our investments and personal information in cyberspace, and the stability and security of the oceans will increasingly depend on allowing the free flow of news and information and developing an independent judiciary and civil society in countries with repressive governments such as china, russia, and many nations in the middle east and africa. liberty to captives: combatting human trafficking as an estimated million people worldwide are trapped in modern day slavery, we are reminded to be vigilant against human trafficking in whatever form it appears. we will use the full force of the law against those who engage in commercial sexual exploitation and forced or bonded labor of men, women, or children; involuntary domestic servitude; trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal; and the illegal recruitment and use of child soldiers. building on the accomplishments of the last republican administration in implementing the trafficking victims protection act of , we call for increased diplomatic efforts and accountability for foreign governments to prosecute traffickers, including penalties for any public officials who may be complicit in this devastating crime. we will highlight the need to stop slave labor, taking steps to prevent overseas labor contractors who exploit foreign workers from supporting military bases abroad or exporting goods to the united states. a republican administration will strategize with partners around the world to prevent the demand for trafficking victims that makes exploitation lucrative and will prosecute sex tourists and domestic buyers to the fullest extent of the law. we will work at home and abroad to ensure that trafficking victims are identified among migrants, refugees, and our own citizens so they receive the rehabilitative care needed to heal and thrive. america's continuing participation in the international campaign against human trafficking merits our support. the goal of our domestic antitrafficking programs should be the rescue and safe return of victims to their homes, not creating a longterm dependency upon public support. we call for greater scrutiny of overseas labor contractors to prevent abuses against temporary foreign workers brought to the united states. the horrific deaths of smuggled workers on our southwestern border at the hands of drug cartels and other gangs highlight the need for total security in that region. facing 21st century threats: cybersecurity in an insecure world cyber attacks against our businesses, institutions, and the government itself have become almost routine. they will continue until the world understands that an attack will not be tolerated — that we are prepared to respond in kind and in greater magnitude. despite their promises to the contrary, russia and china see cyber operations as a part of a warfare strategy during peacetime. our response should be to cause diplomatic, financial, and legal pain, curtailing visas for guilty parties, freezing their assets, and pursuing criminal actions against them. we should seek to weaken control over the internet by regimes that engage in cyber crimes. we must stop playing defense and go on offense to avoid the cyber-equivalent of pearl harbor. the republican congress has passed important legislation to advance information-sharing among entities endangered by cyber attacks. we will explore the possibility of a free market for cyber-insurance and make clear that users have a selfdefense right to deal with hackers as they see fit. it is critical that we protect the cyber supply chain to ensure against contamination of components made all over the world, sometimes in offending countries. our own cyber workforce should be expanded with the assistance of the military, business, and hacker communities to better protect our country. protection against an electromagnetic pulse a single nuclear weapon detonated at high altitude over this country would collapse our electrical grid and other critical infrastructures and endanger the lives of millions. with north korea in possession of nuclear missiles and iran close to having them, an emp is no longer a theoretical concern — it is a real threat. moreover, china and russia include sabotage as part of their warfare planning. nonetheless, hundreds of electrical utilities in the united states have not acted to protect themselves from emp, and they cannot be expected to do so voluntarily since homeland security is a government responsibility. the president, the congress, the department of homeland security, the department of defense, the states, the utilities, and the private sector should work together on an urgent basis to enact republican legislation, pending in both chambers, to protect the national grid and encourage states to take the initiative to protect their own grids expeditiously. confronting internet tyranny internet firewall circumvention and anticensorship technology must become a national priority in light of the way authoritarian governments such as china, cuba, and iran restrict free press and isolate their people limiting political, cultural, and religious freedom. leaders of authoritarian governments argue that governments have the same legal right to control internet access as they do to control migrant access. a focus on internet freedom is a cost-effective means of peacefully advancing fundamental freedoms in closed and authoritarian societies. but it is also an important economic interest, as censorship constitutes a trade barrier for u.s. companies operating in societies like china with advanced firewall protection policies. a republican administration will champion an open and free internet based on principles of free expression and universal values and will pursue policies to empower citizens and u.s. companies operating in authoritarian countries to circumvent internet firewalls and gain accurate news and information online.","['preamble', 'platform', 'republican', 'party', 'reaffirm',

Democratic Party,2024,2020,dem_2024.csv,CSV,"’24 DEMOCRATIC PARTY PLATFORM Democratic National Convention Land Acknowledgement The Democratic National Committee wishes to acknowledge that we gather together to state our values on lands that have been stewarded through many centuries by the ancestors and descendants of Tribal Nations who have been here since time immemorial. We honor the communities native to this continent, and recognize that our country was built on Indigenous homelands. We pay our respects to the millions of Indigenous people throughout history who have protected our lands, waters, and animals. While we meet in Chicago, we also recognize and honor the traditional homelands of the Anishinaabe, also known as the Council of the Three Fires: the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi Nations. We acknowledge the many other tribes who consider this area their traditional homeland, including the Myaamia, Ho-Chunk, Menominee, Sac and Fox, Peoria, Kaskaskia, Wea, Kickapoo, and Mascouten. Democrats continue to support tribes as they advocate for the United States to uphold treaty and trust responsibilities. We applaud that in 2024, under the Biden-Harris Administration, the Prairie Band of Potawatomi Nation became the first federally recognized Tribal Nation in Illinois in 175 years, when the U.S. Department of the Interior placed 130 acres of the Shab-eh-nay reservation in nearby DeKalb County into trust. Preamble Our nation is at an inflection point. What kind of America will we be? A land of more freedom, or less freedom? More rights or fewer? An economy rigged for the rich and powerful, or where everyone has a fair shot at getting ahead? Will we lower the temperature in our politics and come together, or treat each other as enemies instead? The stakes in this election are enormously high. President Biden and Vice President Harris took office during a time of global pandemic, record job loss, and record crime. These past fo ur years, Democrats proved once again that democracy can deliver, and made tremendous progress turning the country around. President Biden and Vice President Harris turned a setback into a great American comeback for working families. We’ve created nearly 16 million jobs, a record number of small businesses are being started, and factories are coming home. We lowered families' health insurance premiums, and we stood up to Big Pharma to lower prescription drug prices. We’re helping students catch up on learning loss, and we’re forgiving millions of crushing student loans. We passed the first significant gun safety law in decades and made record investments in public safety, putting more police officers on the beat; today, violent crime is at its lowest in 50 years. We’re fighting climate change, reducing pollution, and fueling a clean energy boom. We’re rebuilding our nation’s roads, bridges, highways, ports, airports, water systems, and more. We’re seizing record amounts of fentanyl and securing our border in the face of Republican inaction. We’re closing the racial wealth gap and the gender pay gap. We’ve expanded benefits and services for toxic-exposed veterans; and we’re strengthening NATO and restoring American leadership in the world. There is so much more to do. Democrats will fix the tax system so everyone has a fair shot. We will restore the right to choose. We will continue to bring down costs for families. We will continue to reject political violence of all forms and give hate no safe harbor. Donald Trump has a very different vision – one focused not on opportunity and optimism, but on revenge and retribution; not on the American people, but on himself. He and his extreme MAGA allies are ripping away our bedrock personal freedoms, dictating what health care decisions women can make, banning books, and telling people who they can love. They’re rigging our economy for their rich friends and big corporations, pushing more trickle-down tax cuts for the wealthy and powerful, and a new national sales tax that will cost every working family an average $2,500 a year. They’ll cut the Social Security benefits that folks have paid into for their whole lives; and gut Medicare, Medicaid, health care, and prescription drug coverage. They are eroding our democracy with lies and threats, have refused to denounce political violence, and are making it harder to vote. And given the chance, they’ll keep stacking our courts, locking in their extreme agenda for decades. We cannot let that happen. President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats are running to finish the job. To grow our economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down. To reward work, not wealth. To lower costs. To tackle the climate crisis, lower energy costs, and secure energy independence. To protect communities and tackle the scourge of gun violence. To secure the border and fix the broken immigration system. To advance the President’s Unity Agenda. To strengthen American leadership worldwide. History has shown that nothing about democracy is guaranteed. Every generation has to protect it, preserve it, choose it. We must stand together to choose what we want America to be.

His economic agenda is about Main Street, not Wall Street. It’s about ending the days of trickle-down economics and investing in America – in all Americans – and delivering for communities too long left behind. While Democrats keep fighting to lower costs for working families, Trump is rigging our economy for his Mar-a-Lago friends and billionaire donors, who like him, are only in it for themselves. As president, Trump doubled down on the trickle-down policies of the past, cutting investment in infrastructure and education, and rewarding big corporations that ship jobs and profits overseas. He vowed to bring new factories to communities across America, but left nothing behind but a string of broken promises. Democrats have a different record. We’re delivering on President Biden’s pledge to rebuild our economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down. We’re investing in America – in our infrastructure, our industry, our people, and our future. While Trump left office with historic budget deficits and the worst jobs record since Herbert Hoover, since President Biden took office, this country has come back from the brink, the deficit has fallen by over $1 trillion, and we have the best jobs record since John F. Kennedy. We’re powering the strongest economic recovery in the world. ECONOMIC PROGRESS At the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, in the midst of the worst economic crisis in 100 years, experts feared a stagnating recovery and even worried about a new recession. But Democrats chose to put workers first, and instead of recession, America has seen remarkable strength and resilience. Our economy grew by 3.1 percent last year – the fastest rate of any major economy in the world. We’ve added nearly 16 million jobs – not only recovering all the positions lost during Trump’s botched handling of COVID, but also adding 6.3 million more than existed before the pandemic – surpassing pre-pandemic projections for the labor market. During this Administration, 30 states from Mississippi to Pennsylvania have seen record-low unemployment; and the run of low unemployment nationwide hasn’t been this long in over 50 years. Wages are up across the board, and rising fastest for lower-income workers, Black workers, Latinos, and women. Today’s recovery is the fairest on record; in just four years, we’ve erased 40 percent of the wage inequality gap that took four decades to build. A record 18 million small business applications have been filed since President Biden took office, each one of them an act of hope. While too many families still feel the pain of inflation at the grocery store, or around the kitchen table when they sit down to pay their bills, we’re making progress. Wages are rising faster than prices, and inflation today is down nearly two-thirds from its peak. We have to finish the job. Democrats will keep fighting to prevent the kind of supply chain shocks and corporate greed that have done so much to raise prices. And we'll keep investing in American workers, American jobs, and American families, bringing factories home to win the race for the future. Democrats know the story of the middle class isn’t separate from the state of the economy – it’s at its heart. And we’ll never quit fighting to make sure that everyone is in on the deal. INVESTING IN AMERICA Infrastructure We can’t have the best economy in the world if we don’t have the best infrastructure. And for generations, American infrastructure was the envy of the world. But over the years, we stopped investing in it, and we fell to thirteenth in infrastructure rankings. The Trump Administration declared it “Infrastructure Week” every week for four years, and never built a thing. But under President Biden, we’re finally rebuilding our roads, bridges, ports, airports, water systems, electric grids, broadband, and more, paving the way for a great American “Infrastructure Decade” that will create hundreds of thousands of good-paying union jobs. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is breaking ground on over 57,000 projects across 4,500 communities nationwide. We’re rebuilding major roadways, from the Blatnik Bridge, a vital link between Wisconsin and Minnesota that carries more $4 billion in goods a year through the largest Great Lakes port; to a key stretch of the I-10 outside Phoenix that sees 126,000 vehicles a day. We’re making the biggest investment in public transit in history, and at last building America’s first true high-speed rail lines. We’re replacing every toxic lead pipe in the country within a decade, so every child can turn on the faucet at home or at school and drink clean water without risking cancer or brain damage. We’ve added over 80,000 megawatts of new clean power capacity, the equivalent of building 40 Hoover Dams, to help shrink energy costs and meet ambitious climate goals. And we’re bringing affordable, reliable, high-speed internet to every American household. High-speed internet is as vital to our economy today as electricity first was a century ago; Americans need it to do their jobs, to do their homework, to access health care, and to stay connected. But a full 45 million of us still live in areas where there is no high-speed internet. Democrats are closing that divide. These projects don’t just build infrastructure, they create hundreds of thousands of good jobs for American workers. Manufacturing Democrats are also taking historic steps to bring home critical supply chains, and to reaffirm our nation’s leadership in cutting-edge industries that America in fact often pioneered. After the pandemic exposed our reliance on foreign-made semiconductors, we passed the CHIPS and Science Act, to restore America’s role producing the tiny computer chips needed to make everything from cell phones to dishwashers to cars. And as the climate crisis makes the shift to clean energy more urgent, we passed the Inflation Reduction Act, making the world’s biggest investment ever in building renewable energy, electric vehicles, and other green technologies here at home. The President's Investing in America agenda has incentivized a historic $877 billion in private funding across the United States to date. Companies are investing hundreds of billions more than under Trump to build new factories. In fact, under President Biden, more than a dozen states have seen the largest private sector investments in their history. We’ve designated more than 30 tech hubs in communities from Reno, Nevada; to Charlotte, North Carolina; to North Central Pennsylvania. And we’ve made sure that lower-income counties see a larger share of investment. Today, instead of exporting American jobs for cheaper labor, we’re creating American jobs and exporting products, leaving no one behind. Under President Biden, we’ve also boosted funding for the kind of research and development that can seed economy-transforming breakthroughs, like the internet. In recent years, America became one of the world’s only major countries to pull back on R&D investments; Democrats are changing that. President Biden for example launched the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) in 2022, to find game-changing medical cures and treatments and transform important areas of medicine. Under his leadership, we’ll continue supporting NASA and America’s presence on the International Space Station, and working to send Americans back to the moon and to Mars. Democrats will keep America at the forefront of scientific discovery and innovation, responsibly leading the way in the defining fields of the future, like AI, biotech, quantum computing, advanced materials, and more. GOOD JOBS These generational investments are transforming our economy, creating new businesses, new jobs, and new cycles of hope – in red states and blue states; in rural, urban, and Tribal Nation communities too long left behind. In all, President Biden’s agenda has already created nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs, and 880,000 more jobs in construction, building the roads, factories, and dreams of our future. More Americans are employed in these fields and clean energy today than ever were under Trump. President Biden’s agenda requires that any federally-financed infrastructure job must include wage and labor protections. And we’re making sure that these projects use American-made goods, by strengthening “Buy American” procurement rules to their toughest level in seven decades. That means every federally funded infrastructure project is being built with American-made steel, lumber, drywall, concrete, and other products, by American workers. And the Administration has taken historic steps to ensure that these workers are paid prevailing wages, with the free and fair choice to join a union; and to incentivize project labor agreements. President Biden believes that you shouldn't have to go to a four-year college to live a good, middle-class life. Democrats are working to make sure that every American can access these quality new jobs, where many people can earn over $100,000 a year. The American Rescue Plan supported more than 4,300 state- and local-government workforce development programs; while our Investing in American agenda is expanding job-training partnerships between high schools, community colleges, unions, and employers. We have a million trainees enrolled in registered apprenticeships today. Apprenticeships have long provided a reliable path to the middle class, empowering workers to earn while they learn, not only in traditional trades, but also in new cutting-edge industries. Extreme Republicans have proposed gutting funding for registered apprenticeships in this year's budget. We’ll keep making historic investments in them to keep expanding opportunity , including by partnering directly with unions. Democrats know that Wall Street didn’t build America. The middle class built America – and unions built the middle class. President Biden and Vice President Harris are proud to lead the most pro-union Administration in history. President Biden named staunch labor allies and former union leaders to positions across the government, and empowered them to fight for good jobs and workers’ rights. Biden is the first President to walk a picket line, joining UAW workers on strike in Detroit before they won historic wage increases last year. He knows that when unions win, all workers benefit; and as we rebuild our economy for the future, every worker needs a voice and a fair shot. Democrats will keep fighting to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, to give everyone the right to organize for better pay, benefits, and working conditions, and to hold abusive bosses accountable for violating workers’ rights. We oppose state right-to-work laws, which drive down wages and leave workers unsafe; and we support penalizing employers who engage in union busting. We’ll work to pass the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act, guaranteeing public sector bargaining rights; and to codify a right to organize for domestic workers, farm workers, and other unprotected laborers. Democrats will continue to create strong labor standards for jobs created with taxpayer dollars through legislation and with strong Buy American rules. Consistent with the law, we will ensure that federal grants and other assistance to employers are contingent on recipients committing to not interfering with workers’ efforts to form a union. By leveraging the benefits of federal grants for infrastructure, manufacturing and services, we will seek to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to participate in the American Dream. We’ll strengthen enforcement and penalties for safety, wage, and other labor and employment violations. And, Democrats will continue to aggressively hold companies accountable for violating child labor law. We’ve increased funding for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to protect workers on the job; and we’ll continue to support workplace whistleblowers. At the same time, we’re pushing to guarantee workers the pay, benefits, and protections they deserve as well. We passed the Butch Lewis Act, keeping over 2 million people’s hard-earned pensions solvent. We also raised the minimum wage for federal contractors to $17.20 an hour, and will keep pushing Congress to increase it to at least $15 for all Americans. We’re making millions more hourly workers eligible for overtime pay; and we’ve cracked down on wage theft and exploitation, recovering over $750 million for low-wage workers wrongly denied pay. We’re making it harder for employers to misclassify workers as independent contractors to avoid paying them full pay and benefits. We’re banning most non-compete agreements, freeing workers to move between jobs and negotiate. And we’ve restricted mandatory arbitration, so fewer employers can silence wronged employees in a workplace dispute. We also recognize that the U.S. Postal Service is the world’s most efficient, and Democrats are wholly committed to supporting a public U.S.P.S. We will fight all efforts to privatize it and will work to ensure that it’s financially sustainable. We will protect its universal service obligation and on-time delivery. And we will support a Board of Governors and a Postal Regulatory Commission that champion a strong public Postal Service. Trump has a very different record. As President, he not only failed to bring manufacturing jobs home, he pushed to cut funding for R&D and job training. He gave tax breaks to big corporations, with no condition that they invest in workers or innovation in return. He stacked his Labor Department and National Labor Relations Board with corporate lawyers who made it harder to organize, not easier. His Administration ripped protections from federal workers, slashed workplace safety inspections, and blocked increases in overtime pay. Now, Trump and his allies are vowing to repeal key pieces of the Biden agenda – stalling historic progress; undermining American manufacturing; and costing hundreds of thousands of Americans the good paychecks and future prospects that they deserve. Democrats won’t let that happen. We fought hard to pass the most significant investments in America in generations. Now, we’ll continue the important work of implementing them, to be sure that the benefits are shared in every corner of America and create good-paying jobs that folks can raise a family on, with the chance to join a union, and that rely on materials made here at home. We cannot go backwards. We have to own these industries and jobs of the future. SMALL BUSINESSES Small businesses are the engine of America’s economy and the glue of our communities. They employ nearly half of all private sector workers, and drive half of all economic activity. They embody the vision and grit that literally built this country. When President Biden took office, our economy was reeling and millions of small businesses were hanging by a thread. Business owners faced the prospect of losing not just their livelihoods, but their dreams, their life’s savings, and their hopes of leaving something behind for their kids. So Democrats moved fast. Within weeks, we reformed the Paycheck Protection Program, getting game-changing help to thousands of America’s smallest businesses, which had been shut out by Trump. Then, we passed the American Rescue Plan and helped 6 million small businesses pay their bills and workers and stay afloat. And thanks to that legislation, we provided additional support to 100,000 restaurants and 220,000 child care centers serving millions of kids, which working parents rely on. Not a single Republican voted for it. Since then, Democrats have passed other historic laws, to build infrastructure, semiconductors, clean energy, and the small-business supply chains that support those cutting-edge industries, here at home. The Administration is expanding access to capital, business opportunities, and training to help those small businesses; while working for a fairer tax code, to level the playing field for small entrepreneurs who have to compete against corporate giants. The Administration has invested a record $12 billion in Community Development Finance Institutions (CDFIs), to support small businesses and growth across low-income communities. The Small Business Administration is nearly halfway to its goal of providing $250 billion in financing to 500,000 small businesses by 2030. For example, to get mom-and-pop businesses the small loans, under $150,000, that are often hard to secure, the SBA has brought in additional non-traditional lenders that specialize in working with underserved small businesses. It’s now on track to double these loans by year’s end, compared to 2020. The Administration is also directing billions of dollars to community lenders and state-level small-business programs. Along with initiatives like Vice President Harris’s Economic Opportunity Coalition, it is mobilizing hundreds of billions more in private investment. At the same time, the federal government this year set a record for small business contract spending, awarding them 28 percent of total procurement dollars, directly supporting a million jobs. It is on track to meet its goal of increasing federal contracts awarded to small disadvantaged businesses by 50 percent. As a result, America is today in the midst of a historic small-business boom. A record 18 million new business applications have been filed since Joe Biden became president – the three strongest years of new business growth in history, and over 90 percent faster than pre-pandemic averages. Since the pandemic, the share of Black households owning a business has more than doubled, Latino business ownership is up 40 percent, and women own a record share of businesses. As President Biden often says, each new business formed is an act of hope. Thanks to President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Minority Business Development Agency is now a permanent part of the Commerce Department, where it’s training underserved entrepreneurs. The SBA’s innovative Community Navigators program meanwhile helped 350,000 small businesses tap into resources that have helped them grow. In a second Biden term, we’ll make that Navigator program permanent, and include new lenders, new markets, and fairer taxes. Trump still puts Wall Street before Main Street. As president, he slashed the tax rate for giant corporations, but left small businesses behind. His disastrous response to COVID funneled assistance to well-connected friends and companies, but left too many of our smallest businesses without essential help. More than 300,000 closed. He’s now running on a plan to double-down on his tax scam to benefit big corporations and billionaires. His Congressional allies keep trying to slash SBA funding, and to repeal our investments in infrastructure and manufacturing – the same ones that are lowering costs for small businesses, boosting their revenue, and helping millions to thrive. Democrats won’t let that happen. AGRICULTURE American farmers are the backbone of our country. They feed America, and help feed the world. But over the years, trickle-down economics has hit rural America hard. Farming costs have gone up and incomes have gone down. Big Agriculture moved in, telling too many small farms that the surest path to success was to get big or get out. As a result, we lost over 400,000 farms in America in the last 40 years, and rural communities have paid a steep price. Too many young people have had to leave their hometowns to find good-paying work and a shot at their dreams. The President believes that no one should have to leave the community where they grew up just to find opportunity. His Investing in America agenda is investing in all of America, including farms and rural areas. It’s creating new sources of income for farmers and increasing competition among suppliers, to both lower the cost of farm inputs and to get small and mid-size farmers a larger share of profits. The Inflation Reduction Act is helping farmers and ranchers adopt climate-smart practices, which make the land more resilient and increase profitability, while connecting them to new markets and premiums for sustainably produced commodities. The Administration recognizes the critical role that our land stewards play in our food systems, economy, and environment, and is working hard to drive both public and private funds to reward these champions for nature for their hard work. The Administration has also supported independent meat and poultry processing, reducing producers’ reliance on big companies to buy their product; and it’s working to make livestock and poultry markets fairer and more transparent. Today, family farms have more income from more varied sources, so their children have more opportunity to stay family farmers. At the same time, the Administration is helping family farmers service distressed loans in order to keep their lands and ultimately pass them down to their kids. It has worked with many farmers to boost the production of expensive fertilizer, increasing supply and easing costs for everyone else. The U.S.D.A. also expanded farm insurance to allow for more double cropping, a practice that increases farm earnings, expands the food supply, and helps lower average food prices for American families. Going forward, Democrats will also work to get farmers the right to repair their own equipment, without having to pay big equipment makers for diagnostic tools and repairs. And we will look to further limit foreign ownership of U.S. farmland to protect our food supply and national security. Throughout, Democrats have stood by farm workers. We are working to improve workers’ safety at meat processing facilities, and we will continue to enforce and advance labor and environmental rules, for example promoting organizing rights and requiring overtime pay, and boosting protections against harmful pesticides and extreme heat. FIGHTING POVERTY As Democrats, we believe in an America where people look out for one another and leave no one behind. But we know we still have a long way to go to make America’s promise real for everyone. Some 40 million Americans still live in poverty. The pandemic made things worse, hitting the poor hardest, and pushing millions more families to the brink. The American Rescue Plan drove poverty to record lows in 2021. It expanded the Child Tax Credit and made it available to all low-income children for the first time, helping to slash child poverty by nearly half. It tripled the maximum Earned Income Tax Credit for millions of low-income workers, so their taxes wouldn’t push them deeper into poverty. It kept 8 million families in their homes, child care centers open, and small businesses on their feet. It increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, helping tens of millions of Americans keep food on the table. Not a single Republican voted for the bill. And the Administration has done more. It reversed a Trump-era policy that would have risked putting half-a-million children in poverty. It modernized SNAP benefits for the first time since 1975, permanently increasing them and lifting more than 2 million people, including over a million children, out of poverty as well. President Biden signed into law a permanent special summer nutrition program that will help 21 million kids. And he successfully blocked Congressional Republican proposals that would’ve increased poverty by slashing health care, housing, food assistance, and more. Now, it’s time to finish the job. Democrats know that most folks fundamentally want the same things – not a hand out, but a fair shot. That’s why we’ll keep pushing to restore the expanded Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit, which proved so effective at reducing poverty before Republicans let them expire. We’ll work to finally raise the federal minimum wage to at least $15-an-hour. We’ll fight for paid leave, better health care, and more investment in public schools and affordable housing. We’ll reduce the need for foster care, by supporting families and engaging kin. We’ll further expand public transit, connecting communities that have been cut off for too long. We’ll keep working to get more low-income families access to affordable banking as well, and to boost the supply of capital and loans by investing more in CDFIs. We’ll also push to make the New Markets Tax Credit permanent, drawing new investment to low-income communities nationwide. And we’ll continue to reject Republican proposals to increase poverty by making devastating cuts to programs that vulnerable Americans count on. In the wealthiest nation on earth, we all benefit when we help one another. Democrats will keep working to build an economy that rewards work, not wealth; where we care for the most vulnerable, and unleash the potential that all our children have to grow and thrive. We remain committed to fighting poverty and enabling all Americans to live up to their God-given potential. ENDING SPECIAL INTEREST GIVEAWAYS To invest in the American people and reduce the deficit, Democrats are also ending giveaways to big corporations and special interests that have benefitted at the expense of American taxpayers for too long. We’re seizing a tremendous opportunity for savings on prescription drugs and insurance. The Administration has already cracked down on one of Big Pharma’s biggest scams, by finally giving Medicare, the single biggest buyer of drugs in America, the ability to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, as the VA and private insurers have done for years. The Administration is also requiring drugmakers to reimburse Medicare if they hike prices faster than inflation. That kind of markup pads Big Pharma profits, wasting taxpayer dollars. Democrats will expand the number of drugs subject to price caps and negotiation under the Inflation Reduction Act, saving taxpayers nearly $160 billion over the next 10 years, as Medicare will no longer have to pay Big Pharma exorbitant prices. At the same time, we’ll keep pushing to crack down on outsize insurance company profits, for example by requiring health insurers to reimburse Medicaid if they bill more than they actually spend on patient care. We also believe in saving taxpayers money by investing more in preventative health care, vaccines, and other treatment for Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries, avoiding unnecessary medical costs by keeping folks healthy – investing in America, and in the American people. Chapter Two: Rewarding Work, Not Wealth To any American with the ingenuity and drive to make a million bucks, President Biden says, great. Just pay your fair share in taxes. A hedge fund manager or CEO should never pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or firefighter. A company with billions of dollars in profits should not pay $0 in taxes. A fair tax code is how we invest in the things that make our nation strong, like health care, education, a clean environment, and the national defense. It’s how we protect programs that Americans rely on, like Social Security and Medicare. It’s how we build a powerful economy, reduce fiscal risks , and lead the world. Donald Trump is focused on rigging the game for his billionaire donors instead. He always puts himself and his rich friends first. In 2017, he enacted a reckless, unpaid-for tax cut that overwhelmingly benefited the very wealthy and biggest corporations. It was full of outrageous giveaways, including a massive tax break for the wealthiest 0.1 percent. It slashed the corporate tax rate by nearly half, with executives plowing their windfalls into stock buybacks for their own benefit, rather than investing in workers or better products, or lowering prices. After weakening labor protections and complaining that wages are ""too high,” Trump is now telling donors behind closed doors at Mar-a-Lago: “You’re rich as hell, and we’re going to give you tax cuts.” That trickle-down approach never worked. Trump’s allies predicted that his tax scam would push economic growth as high as 6 percent, but America’s growth rate barely changed. The law had no impact on the average American’s income – only boosting wages for those in the top 10 percent. Trump’s allies claimed it would pay for itself, but it instead exploded the federal deficit by $2 trillion. Trump’s policies added more to our national debt than has ever been added in a presidential term. Corporate profits have doubled since the pandemic, yet Trump wants to reward corporations with another big tax cut. Republicans are doubling down on Trump’s failed approach and have proposed $1 trillion in new corporate tax cuts. They’ll repeal the estate tax, so the wealthiest 0.1 percent of Americans can pass wealth on to their heirs tax-free. They’ll give American billionaires an average $3.5 million tax break – a giveaway nearly 50 times bigger than what the average family earns in a year. House Republicans have vowed to pay for part of all that by cutting Social Security and Medicare for everyone else. Economists say Trump’s billionaire giveaways and extreme tariffs will slow growth, cost jobs, and trigger a recession his first year back in office, raising taxes on middle-class families by $2,500 a year, and adding trillions to the deficit. Democrats have a different view. We don’t believe we should add $5 trillion to the national debt to give more tax breaks skewed to the wealthy and big corporations. We’re fighting to reward work, not wealth – to cut costs and make the tax code fairer for the middle class, while making the wealthy and big corporations finally pay their fair share. Under President Biden’s plan, no American earning less than $400,000 a year will pay one single penny more in federal taxes, period. We’re working to end special interest giveaways, and to make sure all Americans play by the same rules. And instead of exploding the national deficit, our plan cuts it by $3 trillion over the next decade, delivering real results for the American people in a fiscally responsible way. CUTTING TAXES FOR WORKING FAMILIES Democrats will protect everyone earning less than $400,000 a year from any tax increase; and we will fight to protect and expand other tax benefits for working people and families with children. During the pandemic, Democrats expanded the Child Tax Credit, saving nearly 40 million families with 65 million children up to $3,600 per child per year, and cutting child poverty nearly in half to its lowest rate on record. We expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit as well, saving over 17 million low-paid workers an average $700 a year. And, we expanded the health insurance premium tax credit, saving millions of families who buy coverage on an Affordable Care Act exchange about $800 a year. Republicans are opposed to this tax relief for families that need it. They already blocked renewal of our Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit expansions, pushing 3 million children back into poverty. Republicans also keep trying to repeal our premium tax credit expansions, which will raise health care costs for millions of families. Democrats will keep fighting to restore and protect that tax relief, giving tens of millions of families some breathing room again. And President Biden has also proposed a $10,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers and people selling their first homes, to help reduce housing costs for working families. The Treasury Department and the IRS are also making it easier and cheaper for Americans to file their taxes and collect the refunds they’re owed. The IRS successfully piloted a free, easy-to-use online tool, Direct File, which has already saved taxpayers millions of dollars in filing fees. It has since announced that Direct File will be a permanent offering, saving users an average $150 in filing costs – but Republicans keep trying to defund this free tool. MAKING THE WEALTHY & BIG CORPORATIONS PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE President Biden’s plans will cut taxes for middle-class and low-income Americans – and we’ll finance those cuts by making the ultra-wealthy and big corporations finally start paying their fair share. There are a thousand billionaires in America, and they pay an average 8 percent in taxes – a far lower rate than a firefighter or teacher. Democrats will make billionaires pay a minimum income tax rate of 25 percent, raising $500 billion in 10 years. We’ll end the preferential treatment for capital gains for millionaires, so they pay the same rate on investment income as on wages. We’ll put an end to abusive life insurance tax shelters, and stop billionaires from exploiting retirement tax incentives that are supposed to help middle-class families save. We’ll eliminate the “stepped-up basis” loophole for the wealthiest Americans, so they can’t avoid paying taxes on their wealth by passing it down to heirs. Democrats will close the “carried interest” loophole, which wealthy fund managers have long used to halve tax rates on their own personal pay, so they pay a lower rate than some teachers or firefighters do. That’s wrong. And, we’ll increase our new stock buyback tax to 4 percent to discourage stock buybacks that benefit executives and wealthy shareholders, instead of workers and consumers. We will also keep upping the pressure on wealthy and corporate tax cheats that fail to pay what they owe. The IRS was severely underfunded for years; but Democrats are improving IRS services for everyday taxpayers and reviving enforcement against wealthy and corporate tax cheats, raising more than an estimated $440 billion in additional revenue as a result. The IRS has already collected over $500 million in unpaid taxes from less than 2,000 delinquent millionaires, and launched efforts aimed at thousands of other millionaires who hadn’t filed a return in years. Democrats will protect this progress by continuing to invest in modernizing the IRS. Republicans are working to reverse it, protecting wealthy tax cheats and increasing the deficit instead. Democrats will also make billion-dollar companies pay their fair share. In 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion in profit, but paid zero in federal income taxes. Corporations are seeing record margins, but their share of federal taxes has fallen below 10 percent, down from 30 percent in the 1950s. It’s wrong. Trump doesn’t care: he slashed the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, down from 35 percent. President Biden will raise that rate back to 28 percent. And for those billion-dollar tax dodgers, the President signed a historic 15 percent corporate minimum tax into law. He also reached a global minimum tax agreement with 140 countries, so that big multinational companies will no longer be able to pit nations against one another in a race to the bottom. And, Biden will double the tax rate that American multinationals pay on foreign earnings to 21 percent; and end incentives, introduced by Trump, that encourage companies to shift jobs and operations overseas and book profits in low-tax countries. Democrats oppose unfair loopholes and wasteful subsidies that benefit special interests at everyone else’s expense. We will fight to get rid of them. That starts by eliminating tens of billions of dollars in subsidies for oil and gas companies. It means ending special tax breaks for corporate jets, and boosting fuel taxes on corporate and private jet travel, saving taxpayers $4 billion over 10 years. And we’ll no longer permit companies to deduct the cost of paying executives more than $1 million a year. Corporations shouldn’t get a tax break for giving huge pay packages to CEOs. We’ll also eliminate the so-called “like-kind exchange” loophole that allows wealthy real estate investors to avoid paying taxes on real estate profits, as long as they keep investing in real estate – a tax break that Trump protected for himself and other corporate landlords in his 2017 tax scam. No other industry has that kind of sweetheart deal; it ends now. Chapter Three: Lowering Costs Today, our economy is growing, wages are rising, and a record number of Americans have good jobs. But for too many hard-working families, the cost of living is too high. Lowering costs is Democrats’ number one economic priority. We’re using every tool to bring prices down on health insurance and prescription drugs, including negotiating the price of commonly used drugs for diabetes and heart failure; and on housing, child care, internet, banking, credit cards, and more. We have more to do, but our actions are already putting thousands of dollars a year back in people’s pockets. Those savings add up, and Democrats will keep fighting until every American feels them. When the pandemic disrupted supply chains, everyday items became hard to get, raising prices. When Russia invaded Ukraine, food and gas prices spiked more. As companies’ costs went up, they raised prices, too. President Biden worked across industries to ease supply bottlenecks and get goods and energy flowing again. He delivered, and inflation has since dropped two-thirds from its peak. But some companies haven’t passed those new savings on to consumers. Their costs have come down, but they’ve kept prices high anyway, boosting profits. Corporate profits have more than doubled since 2017. Last year, after-tax profit ratios for corporations outside the financial sector were their highest in 90 years. President Biden’s lowering costs agenda is historic in scope, attacking the issue from every angle to help cut costs for consumers, crack down on price gouging, and get companies to use their record profits to reduce prices long-term. It’s also investing in making things in America again to boost supply, push down prices, and bring jobs home. Donald Trump hasn’t offered a single solution to lower families’ costs. He wants to drag America backwards, with extreme import tariffs that will make life more expensive for folks nationwide. And for corporations that hiked prices and doubled profits since the pandemic, Trump wants to reward them with a massive tax cut. Independent analysts say his MAGA tax and tariff plans will increase inflation, cost 3 million American jobs, and slow growth, triggering a recession in his first year back in office. Trump’s plan will increase costs for working families by $2,500 a year. Today, America has built its way back into the strongest economic recovery in the world. Democrats won’t let Trump throw that all away. HEALTH CARE & PRESCRIPTION DRUGS Health Care Health care should be a right in America, not a privilege. Every American deserves the peace of mind that quality, affordable coverage brings. That’s why Democrats fought so hard to pass the Affordable Care Act, providing 45 million Americans with insurance, guaranteeing protections for 100 million people with preexisting conditions, and protecting nearly 180 million people from lifetime coverage limits. Yet even now, 14 years after we passed that landmark law, Trump and Republicans are still threatening to repeal it. Democrats will never let that happen. We’ll never quit fighting to protect and expand the Affordable Care Act, making quality care more accessible and affordable, as the Biden-Harris Administration has done. Today, more Americans have health insurance than ever in history. Coverage is up and costs are down. A record 21 million people signed up through the Affordable Care Act this year, helping to slash the uninsured rate from 16 percent in 2010 to under 8 percent now. Democrats have expanded the health insurance premium tax credit twice, saving millions of Americans an average of $800 a year on coverage; and helping an additional 1.7 million Latinos, 830,000 Black Americans, and 110,000 Asian Americans buy more affordable insurance. Republicans want to let those credits expire, increasing premiums. Democrats will fight to make them permanent. As Democrats, we support Medicaid expansion, encouraging states to provide health coverage to low-income Americans on the federal government’s tab. The Administration has helped over a million people in four states to enroll; and we’ll keep pushing Congress to further expand Medicaid-like coverage to the 2.8 million uninsured low-income adults who live in states where Republicans still refuse the help. Democrats are working to protect kids’ health coverage as well, by removing financial barriers for the Children's Health Insurance Program; and making it easier for families to keep kids on Medicaid. President Biden’s plan will let families go three years without having to resubmit Medicaid paperwork for children younger than six, reducing burdensome red tape. Democrats believe that quality, affordable health care should be available in every corner of America. The Administration has invested in new mobile health clinics; and in keeping community and rural health centers, lifelines for tens of millions of people, open, well-staffed, and well-equipped. We want to double those investments now. And the Administration is cracking down on federally funded health care providers that turn away or otherwise discriminate against people on the basis of race, sex, age, national origin, or disability. Democrats will keep working to grow the health care workforce, so workplace and other provider shortages no longer create barriers to quality care and inflate health care costs. We are investing in programs that train primary care practitioners, registered nurses, mental health specialists, and others to work across our health care system, including in rural and low-income areas. The Administration is also cracking down on surprise medical billing and junk health insurance, so patients are no longer ambushed by unexpected bills or scammed into buying low-quality health coverage. Democrats will expand “no-surprise billing” to include costly ground ambulances; and we’ll keep using antitrust laws to stop hospital, insurance, and Big Pharma mergers that undermine competition and increase health care prices for consumers. At the same time, Democrats will keep fighting to ease the burden of medical debt, which makes it harder for millions of Americans to get a mortgage or other loan for the future. Democrats provided funding to forgive $7 billion in medical debt for nearly 3 million Americans; and the Administration is urging states to use remaining funds to do more. It already persuaded credit reporting agencies to exclude many medical debts from credit reports, boosting people’s credit scores and prospects for the future. In all, these actions have reduced the total number of Americans with listed medical debt from 46 million in 2020 to 15 million. Democrats will keep pushing to exclude medical debts from credit scoring entirely. Democrats also support the Administration’s historic work to close fundamental gaps in women’s health care, including by protecting access to reproductive health care. This includes its efforts to reduce maternal mortality, led by Vice President Harris. She called for states to provide a full year of postpartum coverage for Medicaid beneficiaries, with 46 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands now taking that step. The Administration is also making transformative investments in women’s health research to find better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat health conditions in women, and to make care more accessible and affordable. And it is leading game-changing work to end cancer as we know it, including through the creation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H). Trump has no plan to reduce health care costs for Americans. He and his MAGA allies have spent years working to repeal the Affordable Care Act, trying and failing over 50 times. Now, Trump is once again promising to “terminate” the landmark law, gutting coverage for the 45 million Americans who rely on it for care. Doing so will cost families $13,000 a year, and threaten protections for 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. It will strip 150 million people of preventative care like cancer screenings, and reduce access to mental health and substance use treatment. A Republican repeal will also deny life-changing home care to millions of seniors and people with disabilities, and kick young adults up to age 26 off their parents’ insurance plans. And, it’ll push more of the 500-plus rural hospitals that are already at risk of closing to shut down. Prescription Drugs Big Pharma has ripped off Americans for years, charging two and three times more here than in other countries for the exact same medications. Nearly three in ten Americans can’t afford their prescriptions as a result. Instead of working to change that, Trump gave drugmakers massive tax breaks that only incentivized them to shift production overseas. President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats took on Big Pharma and won. Democrats capped the price of insulin at $35 a month, down from as much as $400, for nearly 4 million seniors on Medicare. And President Biden persuaded the nation’s top three insulin makers to lower their prices for everyone. Now, we’ll fight to expand that $35 cap to cover everyone, saving millions of Americans with diabetes nearly $1,000 a year. Starting next year, the Inflation Reduction Act also caps total out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,000 a year for millions of seniors and others on Medicare. Democrats will fight until that cap covers every single American. For the first time, Medicare now also has the ability to negotiate lower drug prices, as private insurers and the VA have done for decades. It started doing so this year, beginning with 10 commonly used medications for conditions such as diabetes and heart failure. Democrats will push to add at least 50 drugs a year to that list, lowering prices for 500 drugs this decade. Medicare Part-D is also working to cap cost-sharing for life-saving generics at $2 a dose; Democrats will make this mandatory for all Medicare beneficiaries. The Administration is also leading the charge against Big Pharma price gouging, by requiring drugmakers that raise prices faster than inflation to pay the difference back to Medicare, which will then pass savings on to consumers. This will protect over 750,000 seniors, who could save as much as $4,500 per over-priced dose. Democrats will keep fighting to expand these rebates, applying them when drugmakers overcharge not just Medicare, but private insurers as well. We’re also cracking down on improper drug patent listings, which some drugmakers use to shut out competition. Once companies drop their improper patent listings, other companies will be free to make cheaper alternatives. The FTC’s work in this area has already pushed three of the biggest makers of inhalers to lower prices to $35 a month, saving people with asthma hundreds of dollars a year. The Administration also enacted rules to finally make hearing aids available over-the-counter, saving millions of Americans up to $3,000 a pair. And Democrats will continue the Administration’s work to require that any drugs developed with taxpayer dollars be available to taxpayers, including at reasonable prices. Democrats will keep working to lower drug prices by requiring more transparency from the “pharmacy benefit manager” middlemen who generally decide which drugs are covered by insurance and bought by doctors, and how much they cost. All these actions will benefit family budgets. And they’ll boost the federal budget, too – reducing the deficit by $160 billion over the next ten years, as Medicare no longer has to pay Big Pharma exorbitant prices. Every Democrat in Congress voted for the Inflation Reduction Act, the historic law behind these savings. Every single Republican voted against it – against $35 insulin for seniors, against Medicare negotiating lower prices, against saving millions of seniors’ money on life-saving drugs. Now, Trump and his MAGA allies are promising to repeal it entirely, and to funnel our savings back into Big Pharma’s pockets. We won’t let that happen. CHILD CARE, HOME CARE, & PAID LEAVE Child & Home Care The United States can’t have the best economy in the world without strong support for caregiving. But today, the cost of care is too high, pay for care workers is too low, and families are caught in the middle of a broken system. Democrats understand that fixing the caregiving crisis cannot wait. During the pandemic, Democrats’ American Rescue Plan kept 220,000 child care centers open, getting parents back to work and saving families an average $1,250 a year per child. It preserved a million care workers’ jobs, and increased their pay by 10 percent. It expanded support for home- and community-based services for seniors and people with disabilities. And not a single Republican voted for it. Last year, President Biden issued a historic executive order directing agencies to further expand access to affordable care. The Administration also capped child care costs for 100,000 low-income families at 7 percent of their income, saving each an average $2,400 a year. Overall, the Administration increased federal child care funding by 50 percent. Democrats will make investments like these permanent, and guarantee affordable, quality child care to millions of working families for less than $10-a-day per child. And we’ll restore the expanded Child Tax Credit and strengthen Head Start. For seniors and people with disabilities, Democrats will improve and expand home- and community-based services, working toward finally eliminating the 700,000-person Medicaid waiting list, so more people can live and work with dignity in their own communities. We’ll also keep pushing to improve pay and benefits for care workers, for example by fighting to get many of them a bigger share of Medicaid home care payments. Democrats will overhaul the quality of care and quality of life for our nation’s 1.3 million nursing home residents by defending Administration regulations that require minimum staffing standards at nursing homes. Democrats are the only party with a plan to expand access to care, and to make it more affordable and accessible for all. Trump and his MAGA allies in Congress have voted repeatedly to increase the cost of care, for example by slashing Head Start and child care programs, eliminating slots for half a million kids. Trump has no plan to lower child care or home care costs for American families. Instead, House Republicans have promised to slash Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, while their continued efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act will strip millions of seniors and people with disabilities of life-changing home support. Paid Leave America is the world’s only advanced economy not to guarantee paid leave. The vast majority of employers don’t offer it – nearly three-quarters of private-sector employees don’t have paid family leave through their jobs, including 94 percent of America’s lowest-paid workers. The pandemic only made the economic consequences of this failure more devastating. In the United States of America, no one should have to choose between caring for a parent who raised them, a child who depends on them, and the paycheck that they need to survive. Trump and Republicans failed to guarantee any new paid leave to private sector workers. Instead, their various proposals included unfunded mandates on states, tax credits that failed to expand access but subsidized large businesses, and schemes to force new parents seeking paid leave to borrow against their own future Social Security funds. From Day One, President Biden has pushed to do more. He fought to include a comprehensive paid leave program in legislation that ultimately became the Inflation Reduction Act. He instructed federal agencies to expand access to paid and unpaid leave for federal employees. He expanded the Military Parental Leave Program, so all active-duty, new-parent servicemembers can take 12 weeks. And his budget includes the strongest paid leave proposals in history, permanently funding the national paid leave plan that America needs. That plan will create America’s first, full, national paid family and medical leave program, guaranteeing every American worker up to 12 weeks of paid time off to care for a new child or loved one to recover from an illness, in cases of domestic violence, or military deployment. It will help families care for one another, and it will help businesses retain valuable talent and small businesses to compete. Millions more parents will be able to work, and it will add hundreds of billions to our economy. Democrats have pushed for this for decades. It’s past time that America caught up with the rest of the world. GAS & GROCERIES When the pandemic crushed supply chains, prices for everyday items, from food to gas to airfare, went up. But after supply bottlenecks eased, many companies didn’t lower prices in line with their falling costs. President Biden will keep calling those companies out for price gouging, and hold them accountable when they don’t pass savings on to consumers. To lower prices, Democrats will also keep working to boost supply, fix supply chains and promote competition, especially for essential items like gas and groceries that families depend on. Through record energy production of clean energy, oil, and gas, we’ve lowered prices at the pump for American families. The Administration also released nearly 200 million barrels of gasoline from the Strategic Petroleum and Northeast Gasoline Supply reserves; and it is lowering gas prices by up to 25 cents per gallon more in certain markets, particularly in the Midwest, by making cheaper, E15 ethanol-blended gasoline available each summer. And, the Administration is cracking down to prevent collusion by oil companies that could raise prices more. The President also knows the frustration and fear that high grocery prices can cause, and he has taken action to lower costs for hard-working families. He and his team have met repeatedly with grocery CEOs and business leaders, who agreed this spring to lower prices. The Administration is also cracking down on price gouging and promoting competition in agriculture, making everything from fertilizer to poultry processing more affordable for farmers. The President also signed into law the bipartisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act, which lowers shipping prices and helps American farmers export their goods. Trump and his MAGA allies fought these changes all the way, siding with Big Oil and special interests over working families. Instead of standing up to them, Trump just wants to give them another massive tax cut. CORPORATE GREED Today, corporate consolidation is allowing companies to keep raking in historic profits, while continuing to raise prices for working families. In the two decades before President Biden came to office, three-quarters of American industries grew more concentrated. As the President often says, capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism, it’s exploitation. And the American people are tired of being played for suckers. The Administration has taken historic steps to boost competition across our economy, in fields from finance and farming to technology and transportation. We’re banning non-compete agreements so that workers have the freedom to pursue a new job or start a new business. We’re protecting consumers from unfair hidden “junk fees” and price gouging, and shoring up our banking system to keep people’s hard-earned savings safe. During his first months in office, the President launched a Competition Council tasked with coordinating and advancing this work. Agencies have taken dozens of actions to increase competition across markets and industries – from making hearing aids available over the counter, to reducing cargo and rail shipping costs for goods, to support efforts to allow farmers and other Americans to repair their own equipment. The Justice Department and the FTC have increased antitrust enforcement, releasing updated merger guidelines, and halting a slate of big mergers in the airline, food, and defense sectors that would’ve increased consumer prices. Democrats will keep working to make the American economy more competitive for businesses and workers across sectors, from transportation to housing to food. And we will reform hiring and procurement processes across the government, to boost competition among our contractors and suppliers, too. The Administration is also taking broad action to crack down on “junk fees,” the hidden charges that companies add on to people’s bills without their knowledge, reducing consumer choice. We’ve already taken action to crack down on a range of these junk fees charged by airlines, internet providers, hotels, and apartment buildings. We’ve pushed banks to slash unfair overdraft and bounced check charges and took action to cap credit card late fees. We’re cracking down on junk health insurance plans that advertise one rate, but then stick patients with a much bigger medical bill. Over time, these combined actions will save American families hundreds and even thousands of dollars a year – adding up to more than $20 billion a year across the economy – giving people a little more breathing room. And we’ll keep pushing until we ban all junk fees across our economy. Democrats are also working to shore up a safe, secure banking system that protects consumer deposits and holds investors accountable. Democrats have pushed for legislation to hold executives at all failed banks accountable, clawing back compensation and banning them from the industry. We’re working to limit out-of-control Wall Street bonuses that encourage risky bank practices that jeopardize our whole economy. And we’ll keep pushing to pass an updated Glass-Steagall Act, more clearly separating commercial and investment banking and expanding Volcker rule safeguards. We defeated Republican efforts to gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau at the Supreme Court this year; we’ll continue to protect and strengthen that agency and support its critical work. HOUSING A home is more than a roof over your head, it’s a place to raise your family, to build community, and to grow the American Dream. It’s also the biggest investment, and the biggest monthly expense, that most people ever face. Some 15 years after the subprime mortgage crisis devastated homeowners and froze construction nationwide, we’re still seeing the effect of a severe housing shortage that’s pushing up prices and keeping homes out of reach. President Biden has taken historic steps to help Americans rent, buy, and build. In the depth of the pandemic, the American Rescue Plan kept 8 million families in their homes nationwide by preventing foreclosures and evictions. Since then, the Administration has eased rising rents by capping rent hikes in 2 million federally-funded apartments. It led the biggest expansion of rental assistance for low-income families in 20 years. It’s cracking down on slumlords who don’t play by the rules. The Administration has reduced mortgage-insurance premiums on federally-backed loans for 700,000 homeowners; and waived the requirement for title insurance, saving families up to $1,500 to refinance. The relief is helping. More people own homes today than did before the pandemic, and we’re seeing fewer foreclosures than at any time in decades. But Democrats know the surest way to bring housing costs down long-term is to build to boost supply. So the Administration is cutting red tape to help more builders get federal financing. A record 1.7 million new housing units are under construction today nationwide. Going forward, the President has laid out one of America’s most ambitious housing plans in over 50 years. It expands rental assistance to a half-million new households, including to low-income veterans and young people aging out of foster care. It offers corporate landlords a basic choice for the next two years: either cap rent increases at 5 percent, or lose a valuable federal tax break. It offers a $10,000 mortgage-relief tax credit to first-time homebuyers, and $25,000 in down-payment assistance to buyers from families where no one has ever before owned a home. At the same time, the Administration is going after unfair rental “junk fees,” like fees people are charged just to pay rent online or to receive sorted mail. And, we will crack down on corporate landlords who are gouging tenants, for example by capping the amount they can raise the rent each year; and we will go after negligent landlords who don’t maintain basic habitability standards. We will also crack down on those who violate the Fair Housing Act, and on landlords who discriminate against low-income and minority renters and people with housing vouchers. We are rooting bias out of the home appraisal process, which perpetuates the racial wealth gap by unjustly undervaluing millions of Black- and Latino-owned homes. The President’s plan also calls for funding to help build or renovate 2 million homes nationwide – by expanding the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit for developers to build affordable rental housing; and by introducing a new Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit, the first ever to focus on creating affordable housing not for renters, but for homeowners. It also creates a Housing Innovation Fund, to help state and local governments find new ways to increase supply, like by converting empty office or hotel space into apartments. The plan also encourages state and local efforts to take on barriers to building new housing. Democrats are dedicated to increasing the supply of an array of housing options like duplexes, triplexes, and townhomes that bridge the gap between single-family homes and large apartment buildings. By reducing barriers to building housing and providing federal tax incentives for the development of housing for people of all incomes, we can foster vibrant, inclusive communities where people from all walks of life can find affordable, diverse living options. Workforce housing must also be prioritized to ensure that our nation’s teachers, nurses, firefighters, and other essential workers can afford to live in the communities they serve. We recognize that these workers are the backbone of our society, but they are left to struggle with housing costs that outpace their incomes, leaving them unable to live near their workplaces. Democrats will meet this challenge head-on by increasing funding for programs that support the creation and preservation of affordable housing options for essential workers, as well as collaborating with state and local governments to accelerate the development of workforce housing , ensuring that our communities remain accessible and affordable for all. Democrats are working to help Americans cover other housing-related costs, like utilities. Families are already saving thousands of dollars with clean energy tax credits; and 23 million households received free or monthly discounts, saving $30 to $75 per month on high-speed broadband through the largest internet affordability program in history. It expired in May, because Republicans refused to act; but Democrats will keep fighting to reinstate it. We’ll keep working to expand other programs that reduce home heating, cooling, and water bills as well, especially in rural areas; and to speed the transition to cheaper renewable energy, like solar, that will lower people’s bills long-term. The Administration is also leading one of America’s most ambitious efforts to prevent homelessness. Based on a “housing first” principle, it’s helping states and cities prioritize housing as the foundational step in delivering support, services, and jobs to rebuild lives. The Administration will work with Congress and local jurisdictions to increase supportive and interim housing options, and the services necessary to help unhoused individuals stay permanently housed. Instead of trying to solve the problem, Trump has made it worse. Trump has never done anything to ease America’s long-standing housing shortage. In fact, he and his allies benefit directly from the housing shortage. The higher the rent, the more that he and his rich real-estate friends earn. For decades, he made a career of inflating rents and putting homeownership out of folks’ reach. As a landlord, he was sued for race-based housing discrimination; and he was accused of cutting off tenants’ water and heat, to push them out and charge new tenants more. As President, he tried every year to triple rent for low-income Americans in subsidized housing, including the elderly and people with disabilities; and to gut policies that help Black and Latino families access fair housing. Now, Trump and his MAGA allies are vowing to gut President Biden’s historic work. Senate Republicans this spring blocked a bipartisan bill that would’ve provided tax credits to build 200,000 affordable homes; and they’ve repeatedly tried to cut affordable housing and rental assistance programs, preferring to protect tax breaks for corporate landlords like Trump instead. They will weaken the independent agencies that protect consumers from rent gouging, and they will make it harder for working families to buy a home, by reinstating higher mortgage insurance premiums, and by privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a windfall to hedge funds. EDUCATION Democrats fundamentally believe that every student deserves a quality education, regardless of their parents’ zip code or income. We know that education starts well before kids go to kindergarten. Studies show that children who attend preschool are nearly 50 percent more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a two- or four-year degree, no matter their background. That’s why Democrats will provide free, universal preschool for four-year olds, saving the families of 5 million children $13,000 a year. In the wake of the pandemic, that’s especially urgent. The American Rescue Plan made the biggest investment in public education in history, providing $130 billion to help 15,000 districts reopen, rebuild, and catch kids up; funding that has worked to help our children learn. The historic investment spurred long overdue improvements in school facilities and indoor air quality, creating safe and healthy learning environments for students and school staff. Since then, we’ve also provided an additional $2 billion to high-need, Title I schools. We’ve helped districts nationwide train and hire 14,000 more counselors and social workers, so kids can heal from the disruptions of COVID, and cope with the fear of gun violence in order to focus on learning. We increased investments in full-service community schools five-fold , providing health care, nutrition, job training, and other wraparound services for kids at school, investing in their futures and making families’ lives easier. The Administration supports a multitude of approaches that have been proven to help students learn: reducing chronic absenteeism by building social and emotional supports at schools, offering literacy programs, and setting high expectations for student attendance; providing intensive tutoring; extending the school day and school year; expanding community schools; and helping schools to lift student achievement, rather than punishing them based on state standardized tests. We support fully funding IDEA to prioritize students with disabilities and the special educator workforce. We support efforts to provide more timely, well-rounded, actionable feedback on student learning and progress to educators and to families that will support instruction and student success, while upholding rigorous academic standards. We oppose the use of private-school vouchers, tuition tax credits, opportunity scholarships, and other schemes that divert taxpayer-funded resources away from public education. Public tax dollars should never be used to discriminate. And we’ll continue working to increase accountability at charters, holding them to the same transparency standards as public schools. We’ll prioritize education in cutting-edge STEAM fields as well, especially for students from underrepresented communities, preparing every child to compete and thrive. And we’re working to provide every student with a pathway to multilingual education, while ensuring equitable access to a high-quality education for English learners, who’ve historically been underserved. A quality, postsecondary education used to be a ticket to the middle class, but the cost that many folks face for higher education today is crippling families, futures, and our entire economy. It has become a barrier to opportunity. Democrats will make quality, affordable, postsecondary education a path forward again. Four year college is not the only pathway to a good career, so Democrats are investing in other forms of education as well, including career and technical education. The Administration is expanding job training partnerships that connect high schools, local businesses, and labor unions to prepare students for good jobs in high-skill, high-wage, and in-demand industries. It’ll make trade school and community college free for every American. And it’s making record investments in registered apprenticeships – which already train more than one million Americans a year across industries, including cutting-edge industries. Some 90 percent of them stay on as full hires, earning an average starting salary of $80,000 a year. That’s a path to the middle class that families can count on. A majority of college students graduate with student debt. It can be an overwhelming stress, as snowballing interest follows folks for decades, defining the choices they make and the jobs they take, and holding back our entire economy. Although Republican appointees on the Supreme Court blocked the President's initial student debt relief plan for 40 million borrowers, he has not stopped using every available tool to provide relief. His Administration already approved the cancellation of $167 billion in loans for nearly 5 million borrowers, including nearly a million public servants like teachers, nurses, and police; and it has outlined plans to deliver relief to 30 million borrowers in all. Meanwhile, its new SAVE plan is the most affordable student-loan repayment plan in history, helping 8 million Americans – including more than 4.5 million who now have a $0 monthly payment. These savings will transform lives, freeing people to buy a house, to start a family, or to launch a business with new hope. For young people just heading to college now, we’ve already secured the largest increase in Pell Grants in a decade, and we’ll further expand these grants to 7 million more students, and double the maximum award by 2029. We’ve invested a record $16 billion in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs); and we’re working to subsidize tuition at all Minority Serving Institutions for anyone whose family earns less than $125,000 a year. While Democrats work to make the promise of education available to everyone, Trump just sees school as another opportunity for a scam. Trump University not only conned thousands of people into buying worthless degrees, it saddled them with thousands in debt. And, not only are Republicans trying to block our student debt relief, they are slashing funding for job training that ensures workers can access good paying jobs without a four-year degree. At the same time, Democrats have educators’ backs. Teachers, education support professionals, paraprofessional and school-related personnel, and specialized instructional support personnel are the heart and soul of our communities; they give so much of themselves, and inspire our children to dream. The Administration has canceled student loan debts for more than 942,000 public servants, including educators. Public school educators also deserve a raise. We’ll recruit more new teachers, paraprofessionals and school related personnel, and education support professionals, with the option for some to even start training in high school; and we’ll help school-support staff to advance in their own careers with a living wage. We will improve working conditions and support to help make teaching a sustainable and affordable profession. We’ll keep investing in partnerships with HBCUs, MSIs, and Tribal Colleges and Universities to strengthen and diversify the teacher pipeline, so students of every background can see themselves at the head of the classroom and in charge of their schools. SOCIAL SECURITY, PENSIONS, & MEDICARE The right to a secure and dignified retirement is one of the bedrock principles of American life. Before Social Security, almost half of American seniors lived in poverty. Even those who’d spent a lifetime working didn't always have enough to put food on the table or health care they could count on. Democrats changed that: in 1935, we passed Social Security; in 1965, we signed Medicare and Medicaid into law. These are more than government programs – they’re a promise that we’ve made as a country, that after a lifetime of hard work, people deserve to retire with dignity and security. They’ve made tens of millions of lives better. Trump and his MAGA allies are shredding that sacred trust, and saying they’ll cut Social Security to give billionaires another tax cut. Trump has called Social Security a “Ponzi Scheme” and warned “there’s a lot you can do in terms of cutting.” As President, he tried to slash both Social Security and Medicare programs in every budget, and to gut Medicaid, which provides home care to over seven million seniors and people with disabilities. House Republicans have vowed to cut Social Security by over $1.5 trillion, to raise the retirement age, and to transform Medicare into a voucher-like system, threatening the program. Trump will also eliminate protections for private retirement savings, by undermining the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and making it easier for banks to rip off seniors with expensive, hidden fees. Democrats won’t let that happen. Generations of Americans have paid into these programs, with every paycheck of their lives. We’ll never back down from our ironclad commitment to protecting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. We reject any effort to privatize Social Security or to cut any of the benefits that the American people have earned. Middle-class Americans pay 6.2 percent of their income to support Social Security, and the self-employed pay twice that. But people with multi-million dollar incomes pay a fraction of 1 percent. We’ll strengthen the program and expand benefits by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share. We also oppose any actions to cut Medicare benefits. We’ll look to expand traditional Medicare coverage to include dental, vision, and hearing services, which are so key to health and quality of life, by making the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share. The fact is that both Social Security and Medicare are in a stronger fiscal position today than when President Biden took office. Our strong economic recovery has helped to extend Medicare solvency by a decade. And the President’s prescription drug reforms will save it hundreds of billions of dollars, by finally empowering Medicare to directly negotiate lower prices with drug companies, and to collect rebates if Big Pharma hikes prices faster than inflation. If Republicans repeal our reforms, they’ll erase those savings and put Medicare itself at risk. Democrats will make Medicare permanently solvent, by making the wealthy pay their fair share in Medicare taxes. Democrats will stand firm to protect retirement security across the board. In 2021, we passed the Butch-Lewis Act, preserving the pensions of 3 million union workers and retirees who would’ve seen deep cuts, and reversing pension cuts for over 100,000 workers. Going forward, we’ll amend federal bankruptcy laws to make sure no other retirees ever run that same risk. The Administration is also cracking down on junk fees in retirement savings, and reversed a Trump-era rule that had allowed financial advisors to put their own interests before their clients’. Democrats want to make it easier for everyone to save for retirement and retire with dignity. Chapter Four: Tackling the Climate Crisis, Lowering Energy Costs, & Securing Energy Independence Every year, the devastation caused by climate change grows more urgent. Across the country, Americans experience the dire impacts of climate change: Floods and storms wipe more homes off the map. Wildfire smoke spreads thousands of miles, forcing millions to shelter indoors. We’ve had the worst droughts in a thousand years, and the fastest sea-level rise in over a century. Last year was Earth’s hottest on record. Natural disasters and extreme weather have cost America over one trillion dollars in damages in just the last seven years. And they hit the most vulnerable among us hardest – seniors, people with disabilities, people in neighborhoods without resources to blunt the impact. The climate crisis is decades in the making, an existential threat to future generations who deserve better. It’s a consequence of delay and destruction by people like Donald Trump and his friends in Big Oil, who still deny what we all see happening right before our eyes. President Biden is delivering on the most aggressive climate agenda in history. His landmark legislation has unleashed a clean energy boom that’s slashing pollution, lowering energy costs, and has already created over 300,000 good-paying American clean energy jobs. America is now producing more energy than ever in its history. He has taken more environmental actions than any president before him – providing cleaner air and water, making communities more resilient, and forcing polluters to pay for the damage they’ve done. He is on track to protect more of America’s lands and waters than any president before him, and he has restored our global climate leadership. He is positioning America to lead the future – energy independent, resilient, innovative, and strong. Trump is only interested in himself and his wealthy donors, who got rich polluting our country. As president, he gutted more than 125 environmental policies that had protected the American people from toxic pollution, everywhere from sewage plants, to oil and gas fields, to our own homes. He pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement at Big Oil’s urging, weakening America’s role in the world. He fired scientists from federal agencies, replacing them with oil and gas lobbyists who rewrote our nation’s environmental rules. And he handed oil companies $25 billion in tax breaks. Now, Trump is set to do Big Oil’s and polluters’ bidding again. He told oil executives he’d reverse our climate progress and slash their taxes once more – if they’d give him $1 billion for his campaign. Oil and gas lobbyists are already drafting executive orders for him to sign on day one. He wants to roll back the clean energy progress that President Biden has made, gut the Environmental Protection Agency, and let polluters dump dangerous PFAS chemicals in our water. His MAGA allies have tried 42 times to repeal our landmark climate law. If they succeed, they’ll eliminate tens of thousands of good-paying jobs, drive up home energy costs, sicken thousands of Americans with toxic pollution, and cede the race for the future to China. PRODUCING CLEANER, MORE AFFORDABLE ENERGY Across the world, we’re seeing massive new clean energy production and uptake. We’re at the dawn of a new era that will redefine the global economy, and that America must lead. President Biden’s Investing in America agenda makes the largest clean-energy investment in history; and it has already attracted over $400 billion in private sector commitments, to develop and manufacture solar, wind, battery, and other clean technologies here at home. Today, 585 new clean energy manufacturing projects are underway – not just on the coasts, but in 47 states, including in places too often left behind. Some 81 percent of the investments made since our landmark climate law passed are going to counties with below-average weekly wages. America is making leaps forward in energy generation and storage, while modernizing our electricity grid and upgrading transmission lines to deliver reliable, clean power. Private sector companies have announced investment in solar modules that will power 18 million homes; and the Biden-Harris Administration has approved the first nine commercial offshore wind projects in federal waters, set to power nearly 5 million homes. Large-scale energy storage capacity has increased twelve-fold since the President took office, and is expected to double again by year’s end. This clean energy boom has already created over 300,000 jobs and lowered energy costs for millions of families. It puts us on track to triple clean-energy generation by 2030, reducing Big Oil’s hold on our economy, protecting families from wild price swings, and bringing America closer to energy independence than we’ve been in over 70 years. Going forward, Democrats will keep working to incentivize investment in transmission upgrades and new lines, and in the grid-component manufacturing that’s needed to support that growth. We will improve and speed up the processes of environmental review and clean-energy permitting; and further scale up development of clean energy on public lands. We’ll also continue to invest in clean energy research and development, building on America’s legacy as a nation of new frontiers and possibilities. To help find new ways of generating and storing energy, reducing emissions, and boosting climate resilience, we’ll launch an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Climate (ARPA-C), modeled on the defense research agency that’s behind breakthrough technologies like the internet and GPS, and the new ARPA-H that the Administration created to transform medicine. We’ll also establish a new national lab for climate research and innovation, affiliated with an HBCU, Hispanic-, or other Minority-Serving Institution, to ensure the opportunities of the future are available to everyone, and built by everyone. And we will continue to invest in climate research across NASA, NOAA, the National Science Foundation, and other agencies, to make sure that America leads the world in clean energy innovation. LOWERING ENERGY COSTS Democrats’ historic climate and clean energy agenda is lowering energy costs for families and small businesses long-term and today – with cheaper, cleaner energy and with tax credits to make home energy use more efficient and affordable. America’s clean energy boom is giving everyone more energy choices than ever, and more choices mean lower prices. According to the Department of Energy, our policies are expected to slash overall electricity rates by 9 percent and gas prices by as much as 13 percent by 2030, saving Americans tens of billions of dollars. At the same time, the Inflation Reduction Act is providing tax credits and rebates to make Americans’ homes more efficient, so families can immediately start saving on their energy costs, now and for years to come. Families can reduce their bills up to $2,000 a year by making their homes more energy efficient with new insulation, windows, and doors; and by installing rooftop solar panels, home battery storage, and electric pumps for heating and cooling. Democrats are also offering rebates on new, energy-efficient appliances; and people can save up to $7,500 when they buy a new plug-in hybrid or fully electric car, or $4,000 if they buy a used one. The Administration has toughened efficiency standards on new appliances and cars as well, which will further reduce emissions and energy bills. New fuel economy and tailpipe standards alone are expected to save drivers some $6,000 per car by reducing fuel and maintenance costs. The Administration has also taken historic action to lower gas prices at the pump, by standing up to Big Oil’s price gouging, releasing strategic reserves to blunt profiteering, and promoting competition with cleaner, cheaper, renewable fuel. CREATING CLEAN ENERGY JOBS President Biden has long said that when he thinks about climate change, he thinks about jobs. Good-paying union jobs that people can raise a family on. As President, he’s delivering. The clean energy manufacturing and deployment boom ignited by his landmark climate law has so far directly created over 300,000 jobs in communities nationwide; and we’re making sure those jobs meet rigorous worker and environmental safety standards. The legislation is helping to push American factory construction to an all-time high as well, as we build new plants to make things like batteries and electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines, and bring the supply chains needed to power a clean energy future home. The President’s agenda also includes extended Buy Clean and Buy America standards, requiring federal projects to use low-carbon, American-made cement, steel, and other materials; and providing credits for private companies to do the same, creating more American jobs. It also provides extra incentives for private companies to hire registered apprentices and pay prevailing wages. Through executive action and with Congress, Democrats will continue to work to create strong labor standards for jobs created with taxpayer dollars. To help prepare people for these jobs, Democrats launched the American Climate Corps, a new workforce training and service initiative that will put more than 20,000 young Americans to work on clean energy, conservation, and climate resilience projects nationwide. President Biden has set a goal to triple the size of the American Climate Corps by the end of this decade, ensuring that young people are given the skills and tools they need to succeed in careers in our new clean energy and climate resilience economies. The Administration is also making record investments in registered apprenticeships, including in clean energy industries. Registered apprenticeships train more than a million Americans a year across industries, 90 percent of whom stay on in those jobs as full hires. We’re also boosting investment in STEM education and workforce training programs for women and at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other Minority Serving Institutions, to make sure the clean energy and manufacturing jobs of tomorrow are open and accessible to communities that have been too often left out in the past. The Administration is also investing in new sources of income for America’s farmers, and working to make our farm sector the world’s first to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Under President Biden’s landmark climate law, the Agriculture Department is paying farmers to adopt climate-smart practices, which sequester carbon from the atmosphere, improve soil health and biodiversity, and restore water cycles, all while opening new revenue streams from ecosystem services markets. Already, over 80,000 farms covering 75 million acres have adopted these practices. Above all, Democrats will unite against the Republican war on clean energy, blocking their obsessive attempts to repeal President Biden’s clean energy investments. Republicans will not be allowed to pull the rug out from American clean energy businesses, send hundreds of thousands of jobs overseas, and strip all Americans of cheaper, cleaner energy choices, all to please their special interest backers. REDUCING POLLUTION & MAKING POLLUTERS PAY These transformative investments in American energy are lowering energy costs, creating good-paying jobs, revitalizing local economies, and reducing pollution. Transportation is America’s biggest emitter, responsible for a third of emissions. The Administration has put us on track to eliminate all carbon from the sector by 2050. It’s making generational investments in transportation infrastructure, including in cleaner shipping, trucking, transit, rail, and aviation. It issued the toughest-ever fuel economy and tailpipe standards, so new cars both get better mileage, and reduce emissions per mile by as much as 50 percent. With tax credits, Democrats helped quadruple sales of electric vehicles, with the goal that 50 percent of all new passenger cars sold in the U.S. by 2030 be electric. We’re protecting American children from asthma-related diesel pollution by giving school districts rebates to buy thousands of electric school buses so kids don’t have to breathe polluted air. We’ll keep working to electrify the nation’s fleet of school buses, transit buses, and federal vehicles, including the U.S. Postal Service fleet. We’ll double funding to repair and expand active transportation and public transit, reducing pollution and traffic, and connecting people to jobs and opportunity. And we’ll work to electrify our ports and waterways, prioritizing progress towards a goal of zero-emissions freight. We’ll keep pushing to reduce emissions from America's buildings and heavy industry. We support local and state efforts to adopt energy-efficient building codes. We’ll require that low-carbon materials and clean power be used in all new federal buildings by 2030, and invest in upgrading VA hospitals, federal offices, and K-12 public school and community college buildings, making them innovative, energy efficient, and safe places to learn. And we’ll support investments in heavy industry, to make America the leader in clean steel, cement, aluminum, and other products. We’ll also keep stepping up action to crack down on other forms of air and water pollution, repairing damage done by Trump’s failed oversight, and making polluters pay. The Administration has strengthened dozens of environmental and safety standards to reduce smog, soot, carbon, methane, mercury, and other toxic pollutants in our communities. After 30 years of inadequate protections, we finally banned all cancer-causing asbestos, including from homes, cars, and water filtration sites. And we prohibited the use of chlorpyrifos, a pesticide that can sicken farmworkers and children. We also set America’s first national drinking water standard to finally protect local water supplies from pollution with PFAS, toxic “forever chemicals” linked to cancer. Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we’re upgrading wastewater systems. And we’re replacing every toxic lead pipe in America – long-overdue work that will finally guarantee that every person in the country can turn on the faucet and drink clean water. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also includes important work to speed the cleanup of toxic Superfund and brownfield sites that have leached poisonous waste into nearby neighborhoods for decades. To cover those costs, the law finally restored a vital “polluter pays” tax that had lapsed 26 years before, once again collecting revenue on any chemical sold in the United States, and directing it to the Superfund Trust Fund to pay for cleanup. At the same time, the Administration has greatly increased civil and criminal enforcement of our nation’s environmental laws, boosting funding for the Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency, resulting in faster cleanups and tougher compliance. We support increased monitoring, transparency, and community engagement in this work. Throughout, we’ll keep standing up to Big Oil, as our clean energy boom breaks the industry’s monopoly hold on energy markets. For the first time in 100 years, we’ve increased the royalties that oil and gas companies have to pay to drill or mine on public lands; and we’re charging at least 10 times more for the bonds that are required to hold companies accountable for cleaning up drilling sites or capping their abandoned wells, which have been left to spew methane. States and private landowners have for years charged more than the federal government does to lease their lands; it’s time the taxpayers got a similar return. Going forward, we’ll also eliminate tens of billions of dollars in other unfair oil and gas subsidies. When windfall profiteering causes prices to spike at the pump, we’ll release our own supplies to keep costs down for American families. And, when we hear of potential collusion or price-gouging, we’ll hold oil and gas executives accountable. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE For too long in this country, too many communities have been denied the basic security and dignity that comes from having clean air, clean water, and functioning infrastructure. Too many parents still lay awake at night worrying what the rain or soil or water or air is doing to their kids. That kind of inequity goes against everything that we stand for as a nation. To finally change that, President Biden’s climate agenda includes the most ambitious environmental justice actions in history, making sure that the people who’ve suffered most from legacy pollution can now share in the benefits. During his first week in office, the President established the Justice40 initiative, with the goal of directing 40 percent of the benefits of our historic climate and clean energy investments to fenceline communities hit hardest by past pollution. Last year, he gave the program new teeth, with an executive order requiring every federal agency to designate its own Environmental Justice Officer to consider and improve the health impacts of its work on all communities. Every major plank of our Investing in America agenda shares that commitment to environmental justice. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests a record $21 billion in tackling legacy pollution, the biggest effort to right such wrongs in American history. We’re also investing in capping orphaned oil and gas wells, which leak deadly methane into surrounding communities well after Big Oil is gone. And to help ensure new climate and clean energy projects can get financed across America, particularly in communities historically left behind and overburdened by pollution, President Biden and Vice President Harris launched a first-of-its-kind $27 billion national financing network as part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction fund. This program will ensure communities across the country have access to the capital they need to participate in and benefit from a cleaner, more sustainable economy as we slash harmful climate pollution, improve air quality, lower energy costs, and create good-paying jobs. Our climate law makes major investments in long-overdue clean water and sanitation as well. It launched a Clean Ports program to help ease the impact of air pollution around ports and airports, where thousands of trucks move goods in and out, often through neighborhoods experiencing distress as a result of historic disinvestment. It invests in clean public transit, connecting communities that have been isolated or disconnected by infrastructure and development to jobs, healthcare, education and opportunities. And under this climate law, millions of trees will be planted, deploying a nature-based solution to combat the urban heat island effect by cooling our streets and easing the deadly impact of extreme heat on people living and working in these areas. We will continue to implement the President’s Executive Order on Environmental Justice for All, and will seek legislative options to further advance environmental justice. Democrats also know we have a moral obligation to make sure that fenceline communities benefit from the clean energy revolution. Programs like Solar for All are helping to lower energy costs, by installing nearly a million solar rooftops in low-income areas by 2029. At the same time, we’re providing bonus tax credits to draw clean energy and clean manufacturing to former fossil fuel and legacy power plant communities. They powered our nation for generations and deserve a just transition away from fossil fuels. Today, they’re seeing rapid growth. BUILDING CLIMATE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES We have an urgent obligation to make every community in America more resilient to climate change and extreme weather. A record more than 2,300 Americans died after extreme heat exposure last year, making it the top weather-related killer; while as a country, we had to build back from 28 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disasters. It’s not sustainable. The President’s infrastructure and climate laws are improving our climate resilience by boosting readiness and response, including by recruiting and retaining more wildland firefighters, and increasing budgets at FEMA. And, they’re preparing us to better mitigate the impact of each extreme weather event as well. We’ve taken unprecedented steps to reinforce our nation’s infrastructure, building new roads, bridges, and ports that are less vulnerable to flooding. We’re putting power lines underground, so winds can’t bring them down where they catch fire. We’re making our electric grids more reliable and more energy efficient, so families and businesses don’t lose power in critical moments. We’re restoring wetlands to help protect communities from sea-level rise and storm surge. We’ve stabilized the Colorado River System, which provides water for more than 40 million Americans, after the worst drought in over a thousand years. We’ll continue investing in public safety measures, like resiliency and cooling centers, so everyone, including our most vulnerable residents, can find refuge during extreme weather events. And we’re looking out for workers, who often risk their lives on the job in extreme weather, with President Biden for example introducing the first national heat standards to protect workers from dangerous heat last year. Going forward, Democrats will work to pass the bipartisan Disaster Resilience Tax Credit, to help low- and middle-income families and small businesses invest in preparing for and easing the impact of storms, heat, floods, and other natural disasters. Trump refuses to admit that climate change, and any of the devastating impacts that communities nationwide, are real. His allies have promised to privatize the National Weather Service, downsize the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and stop the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research from conducting climate research, making it much harder to predict when extreme weather is coming, respond or help communities recover. CONSERVATION America’s natural wonders are our nation’s heart and soul. They unite and inspire us, and connect us to something bigger than ourselves. From his first day in office, President Biden has taken historic steps to protect, conserve, and restore them. He set our nation’s first-ever national conservation goal to protect at least 30 percent of our lands and waters by 2030, including by supporting locally-led, voluntary efforts. Today, he is on track to conserve more American lands and waters than any President in history – over 41 million acres so far, including dozens of new national monuments, wildlife refuges, and other protected areas, from the Grand Canyon to the Great Lakes. Trump is the only president in history to have stripped more public lands of protection than he designated, opening tens of millions of acres of our most pristine national monuments to mining and drilling. The Administration has reversed that, canceling leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and prohibiting new leasing in Minnesota’s Boundary Waters; restoring important protections for places like Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and Bears Ears National Monument in Utah and expanding the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument in California; and protecting places that are too special to develop, like Alaska’s Bristol Bay. Going forward, Democrats will increase protections for America’s Arctic, and ensure clean water for all Americans by protecting rivers and wetlands. We’ll protect our oceans by working to designate new marine sanctuaries, and protect coastal communities from climate impacts. We’ll keep pushing to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund, partnering with state and local governments; and work to reduce threats to iconic old growth forests. We’ll reward Americans across the country who engage in voluntary conservation on private lands, and we’ll work with landowners to protect endangered species and our economy by restoring habitats and enhancing biodiversity, and continuing to protect lands and waters as National Monuments. GLOBAL CLIMATE LEADERSHIP With these historic actions and sustained engagement, President Biden has restored America’s global climate leadership, once again making our nation the world’s pivotal force against climate change. The United States rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement on day one of his presidency, and President Biden set an ambitious goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, in line with climate science. He used the restored power of America’s example to press other nations to do more, persuading 155 countries to agree to slash methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas, by at least 30 percent by the end of this decade. The United States is increasing the resilience, diversity, and security of our clean energy supply chains, while making sure they reflect our values, including by creating good-paying, safe jobs for workers. The Administration has rallied the world to commit for the first time to transitioning away from fossil fuels. It set a bold new goal for nations to triple renewable energy worldwide and to double energy efficiency by 2030; and it helped to launch a new global clean-energy supply chain partnership to make that happen. As Democrats, we believe the United States has an indispensable role to play in solving the climate crisis, and we have an obligation to help other nations carry out this work. America’s leadership in domestic clean energy development is driving a global cycle of innovation and investment that will help lower the cost of clean energy technologies in a fair and transparent way for all nations. We believe that international climate finance is an important tool in this fight. That’s why the Administration committed to achieve $11 billion dollars of climate financing a year by 2024, to help develop the international clean energy market. And it worked with other nations to achieve a landmark global goal of mobilizing $100 billion in collective climate financing by 2022, fulfilling a promise of the 2015 Paris Agreement. Going forward, we’ll continue to support efforts to boost funding for initiatives like PREPARE, our program to build out better early warning systems for climate impacts in critical regions of the globe. We will use America’s leadership to drive global innovation and build out clean energy supply chains. We’ll work through the Multilateral Development Bank to elevate climate and clean energy priorities within the global development finance system. And we’ll build on our leadership in innovative debt-for-nature swaps, which have helped countries from Barbados to Gabon to restructure over $2 billion in debt so far, unlocking hundreds of millions of dollars for nature and climate investments. Chapter Five: Protecting Communities & Tackling the Scourge of Gun Violence All Americans deserve freedom from fear: to be confident that their children will come home safely from the store or the playground, and to know that their loved one will come home safely from their shift policing the streets. Young Americans deserve a president who’s fighting to keep guns out of school. Women deserve a president who has worked his whole life to end violence against women. Families deserve a president who has delivered safer neighborhoods. Under President Biden, in 2023 the murder rate saw the sharpest decrease in history and violent crime fell to one of the lowest levels in more than 50 years. He defeated the gun lobby and passed the first significant federal gun safety law in nearly 30 years. And, Democrats provided funding for communities to hire more police. During Donald Trump’s last year in office, murders surged by nearly 30 percent, the highest increase recorded in modern history. Trump tells families traumatized by gun violence to “get over it” and brags that he did nothing about guns. His budgets repeatedly cut law enforcement funding. Americans deserve the freedom to be safe, and America is safer today than when President Biden first took office. GUN SAFETY The gun violence epidemic is a scourge ripping apart our communities; it is the leading cause of death for children and teens. Mass shootings at schools, grocery stores, houses of worship, dancehalls, and nightclubs, as well as daily gun violence at home and on streets, devastate American families. President Biden has been fighting and beating the gun lobby for decades, and he’s continued to do so as president. With his leadership, Congress passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA), the first significant federal gun safety law in nearly 30 years. It includes the first-ever federal gun trafficking and straw purchasing law, enhanced background checks for gun purchasers under the age of 21, funding to implement red flag laws, a narrowing of the “boyfriend loophole” to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, and new requirements so all gun dealers now must conduct background checks no matter where or how they sell their merchandise. And, the law helps schools hire and train an estimated 14,000 school-based mental health professionals, including counselors, psychologists, and social workers. President Biden also established the first-ever White House Office of Gun Safety Prevention - led by Vice President Harris - and took nearly 40 gun safety executive actions, including going after dangerous “ghost guns.” He launched new law enforcement strike forces within the Department of Justice to crack down on gun trafficking. While President Biden has stood up to the gun lobby, Trump is proud of doing their bidding. He stood before the NRA convention this year and said, “During my four years nothing happened. And there was great pressure on me having to do with guns. We did nothing. We didn’t yield.” While he “did nothing,” gun violence spiked: Trump oversaw the largest single-year increase in murders in history, including a 35 percent increase in gun murders. He refused to limit the use of high-capacity magazines after a Las Vegas shooter used a dozen 100-round magazines to kill 58 people. And, when confronted with horrific gun violence, he told families to “get over it.” Democrats will establish universal background checks, a step supported by the vast majority of Americans, including gun owners. We will once again ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We will require safe storage for guns. Democrats will end the gun industry’s immunity from liability, so gunmakers can no longer escape accountability. We will pass a national red flag law to prevent tragedies by keeping weapons out of dangerous hands. We will increase funding to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) for enforcement and prosecution, and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for firearm background checks. And, because the gun violence epidemic is a public health crisis, we will fund gun violence research across the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) as well as community violence interventions. POLICING & PUBLIC SAFETY President Biden recognizes the sacrifices police officers and their families make to keep our communities safe. Every day, officers risk their lives for the safety of people they do not know. And since Day One, President Biden has been working to make sure police officers have the tools they need to protect their communities, including more police officers on the street. We need to fund the police, not defund the police. Democrats passed and President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan, with the largest-ever federal investment in fighting and preventing crime, reducing violence, and investing in public safety. That funding enabled cities and states to invest more than $15 billion in public safety and violence prevention, putting more police officers on the beat for accountable community policing, as well as interrupting and preventing crime. In 2023, the Justice Department provided $5.8 billion tostate, local, Tribal, and territorial law enforcement agencies, research institutions, and nonprofits to advance public safety – including funding for 1,730 new police officers in nearly 400 communities. Because police officers should be able to focus on fighting crime, President Biden secured the first-ever federal funding solely dedicated to community violence intervention programs; and he increased funding for crisis interventions, mobile crisis teams, and training for first responders and law enforcement. President Biden also signed legislation replenishing the Crime Victims Fund, which supports programs that assist survivors. Democrats also secured funding for extra security at places of worship and community institutions; and we are investing in Tribal public safety. Public trust, as any police officer will tell you, is the foundation of public safety. Police cannot fulfill their role to keep communities safe without public trust and confidence in law enforcement and in the criminal justice system. Yet, there are places in America today where the bonds of trust are frayed or broken. President Biden took action to enhance public trust by signing a historic executive order on police reform alongside George Floyd’s family. He launched the National Law Enforcement Accountability Database with information on misconduct by federal law enforcement officers, and sharply restricted chokeholds and no-knock warrants for federal law enforcement. And, the Administration is publishing data on the use of force and is also preventing certain militarized equipment from being sold or transferred to local police agencies. Trump oversaw the largest one-year increase in murders ever recorded. On January 6, he encouraged the rioters who attacked the police officers protecting our Capitol; since then, he has promised to pardon these convicted criminals. He is the candidate who wants to defund the police: As president, he repeatedly proposed cutting funding to state and local law enforcement programs, including the COPS program that funds local police officers, for three years in a row. He has called to defund the Department of Justice and the FBI. And, he says he will withhold federal funding from local police departments that don’t adopt policies like stop-and-frisk or assist in mass deportations. Trump has been equally disastrous for accountable policing. As president, he reversed restrictions that limited the transfer of surplus military equipment to local police departments and effectively abandoned pattern-or-practice investigations into police misconduct. When protests followed George Floyd’s murder, he tweeted, “when the looting starts, the shooting starts” and referred to protesters as “THUGS,” and tear-gassed nonviolent protesters outside the White House. If he gets another term, he will resume stop-and-frisk practices and withhold federal funding from local police departments that do not adopt this discriminatory policy. He’s promising to sign legislation to broaden qualified immunity to prevent legal accountability for police misconduct. President Biden is committed to making our country safer for every American, civilians and law enforcement alike. Democrats will pass his Safer America Plan, which calls on Congress to invest $37 billion to support law enforcement and crime prevention. That includes funding 100,000 additional police officers for accountable community policing and $5 billion in community violence intervention , which will help prevent crime, keep communities safe, and build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. We will create a new Violent Crime Reduction and Prevention Fund to give federal, state, local, and Tribal law enforcement the resources they need to fight crime, including to hire more agents, prosecutors, and forensic specialists. We will give communities the tools to crack down on gun crime, retail crime, and carjacking. Democrats will build on the progress in President Biden’s executive order on effective, accountable policing by passing the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. And, we will end racial profiling and religious discrimination in law enforcement. CRIMINAL JUSTICE President Biden is committed to rehabilitation and reentry for people returning to their communities after incarceration, and to building a criminal justice system that lives up to those ideals and ensures that everyone receives equal justice under law. That’s why he’s taken historic steps to make this promise a reality. No one should be in jail just for using or possessing marijuana. Sending people to prison for possession has upended too many lives and incarcerated people for conduct that many states no longer prohibit. Those criminal records impose needless barriers to employment, housing, and educational opportunities, disproportionately affecting Black and brown people. President Biden took historic action to end this failed approach by pardoning people convicted federally for using or possessing marijuana. He has called on governors to use their pardon power to do the same for state-level offenses. And his Administration is taking a major step to reschedule cannabis so it's no longer classified as more dangerous than fentanyl or methamphetamine. President Biden has released a comprehensive strategic plan to improve the criminal justice system and strengthen public safety, including more than 100 concrete actions. The Administration is improving rehabilitation in jails and prisons and helping people rebuild their lives, an important step in reducing recidivism. It has invested nearly $1 billion in job training, addiction recovery, and reentry services across the country; and expanded access to Pell Grants, so people can earn a college degree while they are incarcerated, starting over with new skills. The Administration will keep investing in housing, mentorship, job training, and apprenticeship programs as well. It is working to end the school-to-prison pipeline by reissuing guidance from the Departments of Education and Justice to prevent disparate discipline of children of color and with disabilities and incentivizing states to develop community-based alternatives to prison for young people. And, President Biden reestablished the Justice Department’s standalone Office for Access to Justice to ensure that everyone can get legal assistance. President Biden has used his pardon power to right historical wrongs. In addition to pardoning simple possession and use of marijuana, he’s pardoned or shortened the sentences of people convicted of other nonviolent drug offenses and pardoned approximately 2,000 gay, lesbian, and bisexual veterans who were convicted years ago just for being themselves. Democrats will take action to expunge federal marijuana-only convictions. We will combat drug trafficking and expand the use of drug courts, interventions, and diversion for people with substance use disorders. We will fund a new Accelerating Justice System Reform grant program to provide jurisdictions with critical resources to foster community trust and safety, reduce inequity and justice system involvement, and alleviate burdens on police. We will expand access to public defenders and step up civil rights enforcement, including by boosting funding for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and hiring 50 new Assistant U.S. Attorneys. And, we will remove barriers to legal access, combat hate crimes, and counter cyber threats. To keep children and teens safe and out of the justice system, we will invest in after-school programs, community centers, and summer jobs. And, to ensure young people get a second chance after leaving the justice system, we will automatically seal and expunge juvenile records. Democrats will end state-level use of private prisons and detention centers, and we will restrict state and local practices like solitary confinement, chokeholds, and restraints on pregnant inmates. We will guarantee access to medical care in prison and will eliminate profiteering from diversion, bail, electronic monitoring, commissaries, and reentry programs. We will support rehabilitation and education, including college programs, for inmates in prison and after their release. To help returning citizens succeed upon their release, we will boost access to transitional housing, affordable housing, mental health and substance use treatment. We will limit reincarcerating people federally to only serious violations of supervised release. And, we will work to expand “ban the box” so returning citizens can more easily find work, protect their right to vote, and protect their right to public services like Pell Grants and nutrition assistance. Trump’s approach to criminal justice could not be more different. His Administration threatened federal prosecution for marijuana cases in states where marijuana was legal. As president, Trump granted fewer clemency requests than nearly every president since the start of the 20th century; and many of his grants were reserved for well-connected offenders and close friends and associates like Steve Bannon, Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, and Charles Kushner. HisAdministration cut support for halfway houses and decreased the number of federal prisoners sent to transitional housing. And, it reinstated contracts with private prisons. VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN Ending violence against women has been the cause of President Biden’s life. In the U.S. Senate, with the help of courageous and committed advocates, he wrote the original Violence Against Women Act and spent the following decades working to expand and improve it with each reauthorization. As president, he was proud not only to reauthorize this landmark law but also to strengthen it. Democrats secured the highest-ever funding level for VAWA implementation, and are distributing record funding for local prosecutors, law enforcement, and survivor advocates. Crucially, the Administration has also expanded support for Native survivors and strengthened protections for Tribal communities; improved prevention and services for survivors of sexual assault, including through the Fairness for Rape Kit Backlog Survivors Act; expanded housing protections for domestic violence survivors; and increased services and support for survivors, including survivors of technology-facilitated abuse. President Biden launched the first-ever National Plan to End Gender-Based Violence, and the American Rescue Plan provided immediate crisis intervention, health supports, and emergency services for survivors. He expanded funding for campus sexual assault prevention and is keeping students safe on campus by restoring and strengthening protections under Title IX, including explicit protections for LGBTQI+ students. He signed legislation that narrowed the “boyfriend loophole” to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. He signed into law new protections to support survivors and address sexual assault and sexual harassment in the workplace. And, he signed a historic executive order on sexual assault and domestic violence in the military, transferring key decision-making authority from commanders to independent military prosecutors – the most significant transformation of the military justice system since the Uniform Code of Military Justice was established in 1950. Trump has made it abundantly clear that he doesn’t care about ending violence against women. As president, he failed to reauthorize VAWA. And, his Administration rolled back campus sexual assault protections, making it even harder for survivors to get the justice they deserve. Democrats will work to end sexual assault, domestic violence, online abuse, and all violence against women. We continue to strengthen VAWA; keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers; and expand housing and legal services for survivors. To keep students safe on campus, we will work with schools to implement and enforce Title IX and end sexual harassment and assault in our nation’s schools. We will eliminate the rape kit backlog. And, we will strengthen legal protections for and support survivors of deepfake image-based sexual abuse building on the federal civil cause of action established under the president’s reauthorization of VAWA in 2022. Chapter Six: Strengthening Democracy, Protecting Freedoms, & Advancing Equity President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats know that democracy has always been America’s sacred cause. Whether that’s still true is the most urgent question of our time, and it’s what the 2024 election is all about. America is the only country on earth built on an idea: that all people are created equal. We’ve never fully lived up to that, but we’ve never walked away from it, either. And we won’t let Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans walk away from it now. The President, Vice President, and all Democrats will continue to work every day to ensure that our democracy endures. President Biden has put protecting American democracy at the heart of his presidency. When he took office, the nation was reeling from what it had just witnessed on January 6: a violent mob storming the Capitol, smashing windows, kicking in doors, attacking scores of police officers, and roaming the corridors hunting for elected officials – all whipped into a frenzy by Trump’s lies, repeated over and over for months, to overturn the will of the people. President Biden spent his first term working to restore trust in our institutions, protect our freedoms, and preserve our democracy for the future. President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats have consistently made it clear that political violence has no place in America. Trump refuses to defend core tenets of our democracy: the Constitution, the rule of law, our system of checks and balances. He still doesn’t accept the plain truth, upheld by scores of courts, that he lost in 2020, even describing himself as a “very proud election denier” – and he has never agreed to accept this year’s results. After years undermining public faith and confidence in our elections, he has warned of a “bloodbath” if he loses now. He lionizes the convicted criminals who perpetrated the January 6 attack on our Capitol and brave police, calling those insurrectionists “patriots” and “hostages” while promising to pardon them. We know how Trump will weaken our democracy if he gets another term. He has promised to be a dictator on “Day One” – and we’ve already seen how he fawns over other dictators. He has vowed to weaponize our government to go after his enemies and benefit his allies. He has plans to fire dedicated, nonpolitical civil servants and replace them with loyalists who will do his bidding; and he has promised to exert presidential authority over what have long been independent agencies. And to silence his critics, he suggested the “termination” of our Constitution. The stakes in this election for the soul of our nation are profound. This election will decide whether the next generation of Americans has more rights and freedoms than past generations, or fewer. Trump and Republicans are already ripping away Americans’ hard-won freedoms. Reproductive freedom, freedom from hate, freedom from fear, the freedom to control our own destinies and more are all on the line in this election. Democrats will not let that happen. Together, we will continue uniting and rallying Americans across the political spectrum in defense of our democracy, and making it clear that political violence has no place in America. We will defend our freedoms, restore essential trust in our institutions, and preserve America’s vital role as a beacon of democracy across the world. JUDGES One of a president’s most important duties is appointing the judges who shape our country’s laws. Judges matter. They have the power to uphold basic rights or to roll them back. They hear cases that decide whether women have the freedom to make their own reproductive health care decisions; whether Americans have the freedom to cast their ballots; whether workers have the freedom to unionize and make a living wage for their families; whether children have the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water; and whether a president is above the law. Judicial appointments are crucial at every level of the federal bench, but nowhere more so than on the Supreme Court. The next president could appoint one, two, or more new Supreme Court justices. Those justices will determine what freedoms Americans have – or lose – for the next 30, 40, or even 50 years. The choice is clear. President Biden appointed Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman ever named to the Supreme Court, who has stood up for Americans’ rights and freedoms throughout her career on the bench. Trump handpicked three justices who have pushed a far-right agenda with devastating consequences. The Court’s attack on a wide range of long-established American legal principles – from overturning Roe and eliminating the right to choose, to weakening voting rights and civil rights, to granting immunity for presidential crimes – in fact undermines the rule of law. If he’s elected again, Trump will appoint more justices in the same mold; his past Supreme Court short lists have always been stocked with far-right ideologues. Trump made clear in his first term that his goal was to appoint as many far-right judges as he could, regardless of their qualifications – even appointing to lifetime seats a series of candidates deemed “not qualified” by the American Bar Association. While President Biden has sought to appoint judges who look like America, three-quarters of Trump’s judicial appointees were men and 84 percent were white. If Trump keeps stacking the Court with extreme conservatives, the far right will have final say over our laws for decades to come, wreaking even more havoc on our system of checks and balances and the consequences for our country will be devastating. President Biden will continue to appoint justices and judges across the federal bench who are like Justice Jackson: brilliant jurists committed to defending American rights and freedoms. Judges should reflect the diverse population whose laws they shape, and President Biden has appointed more than 200 highly qualified federal judges who look like America. Nearly two-thirds of the judges he’s appointed have been women, and nearly two-thirds have been people of color. President Biden has appointed more Black women to federal circuit courts than every other president combined; more Latino judges have been confirmed to circuit courts than under any other president; more AANHPI judges have been confirmed than in any other Administration; and after only one term, he is already tied for the most openly LGBTQI+ judges appointed. President Biden has also chosen judges from diverse professional backgrounds, ensuring a range of perspectives and experiences are represented on the federal bench: at least 40 of his judicial appointees are former public defenders, at least 25 have served as civil rights lawyers, and at least nine have represented workers. In President Biden’s second term, he will continue selecting judges who will protect fundamental rights and who represent the diversity of the American experience. We will push for a Supreme Court that follows the rule of law, protects people's freedoms, and abides by the highest ethical standards. VOTING RIGHTS The right to vote and to have your vote counted is the threshold of American democracy and liberty. Without it, nothing is possible; with it, anything is. Decades after a generation of civil rights leaders faced fire hoses and batons, were brutally beaten and even died to secure this fundamental right, it remains under assault. Since their first days in office, President Biden and Vice President Harris have taken action to protect the sacred right to vote in free, fair, and secure elections, especially for communities of color who have been historically disenfranchised. Within the first 100 days of his presidency, President Biden signed an executive order directing an all-of-government effort to promote access to voting. Agencies have taken historic action to help veterans, college students, Native Americans, and other underserved communities register to vote. Because laws are only as effective as their enforcement, the Department of Justice has more than doubled its staff dedicated to enforcing voting rights laws. And because the American people deserve to have faith in their elections, President Biden signed the Electoral Count Reform Act to preserve the will of the people and to protect against the type of attempts to overturn our elections that led to the January 6 insurrection. Trump has a dark and different view, with a long history of supporting rollbacks to voting rights. He has spent years undermining the electoral process and confidence in elections, and continues to spread blatant lies about the election he lost. Trump’s allies in state legislatures across the country have enacted and continue to introduce laws that make it harder to vote and undermine the will of the people. Trump supported Georgia’s voter suppression law, which makes it illegal to hand out water to voters waiting in line. If he returns to the White House, he will seek to eliminate early voting and mail ballots to make it harder for Americans to exercise their right to vote. Key to the right to vote is ensuring that voters pick their elected officials – not the other way around. President Biden has spoken out against extreme gerrymandering and harmful court decisions that perpetuate it, and he has consistently advocated for legislation that would end it and create fair congressional maps. Meanwhile, Trump opposes efforts to draw fairer maps. Congress must restore the protections of the Voting Rights Act and take additional steps to ensure access to the ballot box. Democrats will pass and President Biden will sign the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act to fully secure the right to vote in every state, ensure fair congressional maps for every American, modernize and secure our elections, and curtail the corrupting influence of money in politics. STOPPING THE INFLUENCE OF SPECIAL INTERESTS Too much money flows in the shadows to influence our elections. Advocacy groups can run ads on issues attacking or supporting a candidate right until Election Day without disclosing who’s paying for that ad. Too often, powerful special interests use front groups to run these ads to win at any cost. Even foreign entities that aren’t allowed to contribute to political campaigns use dark money loopholes to try to influence our elections. To fight back, President Biden has called for immediate passage of the DISCLOSE Act, which will require advocacy groups that run ads to influence elections to disclose donors who contribute more than $10,000, and ban foreign entities from contributing to them. Under President Biden’s leadership, the FEC has also finalized a rule expanding political advertising disclaimer requirements for online public communications. Democrats will also fight to strengthen public financing with small-dollar matching for all federal candidates and crack down on foreign nationals who try to influence elections. We will keep super PACs wholly independent of campaigns and parties and pass a constitutional amendment that will ban all private financing from federal elections. Democrats will end “dark money” by requiring full disclosure of contributors and ban 501(c)(4) organizations from spending on elections. And, to curb the influence of special interests in our elections, Democrats will prohibit corporate PACs and lobbyists from donating to anyone they lobby. Trust in democracy is critical to protecting democracy. Democrats will adopt ethics reforms to ensure every American can feel confident that their government is working for them, not for special interests. Democrats will enact legislation to apply similar standards to Members of Congress. Democrats will create a federal ethics commission to strengthen good governance laws, like those requiring financial and lobbying disclosure. Democrats will require all federal candidates to disclose at least 10 years of tax returns. To ensure tax dollars go to work for the American people, not for special interests, Democrats will reestablish merit-based federal contracting and ban political appointees from interfering in grantmaking. And to ensure that policy decisions are guided by what’s best for the American people, not by special interests, Democrats will strengthen laws that regulate lobbying by foreign governments and lower the threshold for registering as a federal lobbyist. REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM Trump’s Supreme Court appointees overturned Roe v Wade, eliminating a fundamental constitutional right and denying women across the nation the right to choose. The extreme act of overturning Roe , which had been the law of the land for nearly half a century, has already had devastating consequences nationwide. Over the past two years, more than 20 states have imposed extreme and dangerous abortion bans – many of which include no exception even for rape or incest – that put the health and lives of women in jeopardy, force women to travel hundreds of miles for care, and threaten to criminalize doctors for providing the health care that their patients need and that they are trained to provide. Laws that limit access to contraception and to fertility treatments like IVF. Laws that were first adopted in the 1800s. More than one in three women of reproductive age, and more than half of Black women and 40 percent of Latinas, now live under an abortion ban. Today, our daughters have fewer rights than their grandmothers. President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats are fighting back to restore reproductive freedom for every woman in every state. President Biden signed three executive orders and a presidential memorandum to stand up for reproductive rights. The Administration is protecting access to abortion, including by creating a new path for pharmacies to dispense FDA-approved medication abortion and defending access in court. It is expanding reproductive health care for service members, veterans, and their family members. The Administration is defending access to emergency medical care, including clarifying that federal law on emergency care preempts state abortion bans, educating patients on their rights, making it easier for patients who have been denied emergency care to file a complaint, and ensuring hospitals meet their legal obligations to offer care. It is challenging threats from Republicans to prosecute people who help women travel to a different state for abortion care, and helping states expand access under Medicaid for women who travel from states with bans. We are safeguarding patients’ and providers’ privacy, including by strengthening HIPAA protections, cracking down on the illegal sharing of personal information, strengthening consumer data protections, and issuing guidance to protect student privacy in this area. And we are ensuring access to accurate information and legal resources, including by launching ReproductiveRights.gov and convening more than 200 lawyers and advocates to support abortion-related legal defense services. The contrast between President Biden and Trump is stark. Trump handpicked Supreme Court justices he knew would overturn Roe, saying it would be overturned “automatically.” He’s said that he’s “proudly the person responsible” for overturning Roe, and he continues to brag about it. Trump is responsible for the more than twenty state bans that are now in effect as a result. He has said women should be punished for getting an abortion, and that states should be able to punish doctors who provide them. If he returns to the White House, Trump will ban abortion nationwide. And his allies plan to ban medication abortion nationwide, without Congress or the courts, by enforcing a law from the 1800s, including prosecuting women and doctors for sending or receiving medication abortion in the mail. Nine in 10 women have used contraception, and Democrats are also working to expand access to birth control. Under President Biden’s leadership, the FDA approved the first over-the-counter daily oral contraceptive, making birth control easier than ever to access. President Biden has also built on the Affordable Care Act to make a broader range of contraceptives available to women at no cost through their health insurance. The Administration has boosted access to free and low-cost services through the Title X family planning program, and expanded access to birth control for service members and through theVA. Trump’s record on contraception could not be more different. Trump undermined access to contraception as president, decreasing access for millions by sabotaging the Title X family planning grant program and weakening the ACA’s coverage mandate. His allies have published plans to further attack access to contraception through executive action, including by further undermining women’s insurance coverage for birth control and reducing access to condoms and emergency contraception. The Supreme Court’s elimination of the protections of Roe has also had devastating consequences for families who have suffered the heartbreak of infertility. Each year, tens of thousands of Americans start or grow their families with the help of in vitro fertilization. IVF is enormously popular, enjoying the support of the vast majority of Americans. Yet Trump’s overturning Roe opened the door to laws that rip away access to this vital care – as we saw when Alabama families had treatments halted earlier this year. President Biden has responded to attacks on reproductive care by expanding IVF access for service members, veterans, and federal employees. Meanwhile, Trump has refused to commit to vetoing the Life at Conception Act, a national abortion ban that threatens IVF access nationwide, and his allies are openly attacking IVF. President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats are committed to restoring the reproductive rights Trump ripped away. With a Democratic Congress, we will pass national legislation to make Roe the law of the land again. We will strengthen access to contraception so every woman who needs it is able to get and afford it. We will protect a woman’s right to access IVF. We will repeal the Hyde Amendment. And in his second term, President Biden will continue to support access to FDA-approved medication abortion, appoint leaders at the FDA who respect science, and appoint judges who uphold fundamental freedoms. WOMEN’S RIGHTS Despite the progress we’ve made since our nation’s founding, there is more work ahead to knock down the barriers that stand in the way of women and girls realizing their full potential. In a country founded on freedom and equality, nothing is more fundamental. No one should be discriminated against based on their sex; and we, as a nation, must affirm and protect women’s full equality. Democrats will fight to make the Equal Rights Amendment the law of the land. When women thrive in the workplace, our economy is strong. Under President Biden’s leadership, more women are in the workforce than ever, matching the lowest annual women’s unemployment rate since 1953, with the narrowest gender pay gap on record. Democrats passed and President Biden signed the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act to protect women’s rights on the job, ensuring that pregnant and postpartum workers have the basic, long overdue protections they need to stay in the workforce while pregnant and as new mothers. Democrats also passed the PUMP Act, so more nursing mothers have access to break time and a private place to pump. To promote pay equity and curb pay discrimination, the Administration ended the use of salary history in pay-setting decisions for federal workers and will expand this protection to most contractors. As the President’s economic agenda creates millions of jobs, he is making sure that women benefit, including through his Million Women in Construction Initiative, registered apprenticeship programs, and the Good Jobs Initiative. He has also expanded opportunities for women entrepreneurs, increasing SBA loans to women-owned businesses by 70 percent, and awarding more federal contracting dollars to women-owned small businesses than ever. And because affordable child care is critical to expanding opportunities for parents, especially women, President Biden helped hundreds of thousands of child care providers keep their doors open to millions of children and saved families thousands of dollars on child care costs. The President also signed into law new protections to support survivors and address sexual assault and sexual harassment in the workplace. While President Biden has worked to support women in the workplace, Trump weakened protections for them. He moved to block an Obama-era rule that required companies to report pay by race and gender, an important tool in the fight for pay equity. He also limited the salary threshold increase under which salaried workers were eligible for overtime, leaving behind millions of workers who would have benefited under the original rule. There is more work to do. Democrats will work to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and end pay inequity not just in the federal workforce, but throughout the economy with penalties for companies that discriminate against women. And, we will guarantee affordable, high-quality child care from birth until kindergarten, with most families paying just $10 a day — and make it free for low-income families. We will protect the health and dignity of older adults and people with disabilities by improving long-term care and supporting family caregivers, and we will invest in care infrastructure by raising wages and the quality of care worker jobs. We will establish a national, comprehensive paid family and medical leave program to ensure that all workers, including women, can take the time they need to bond with a new child, care for a loved one, or recover from an illness. We are also closing fundamental gaps in women’s health care and addressing the maternal health crisis. Women in America are dying at a higher rate from pregnancy-related causes than women in any other wealthy nation, especially Black and Native women. Vice President Harris came into office as a key leader on maternal health and continues to lead the fight for improved maternal health outcomes, elevating the issue nationally and convening experts and activists to find solutions. The American Rescue Plan gave States the option to provide a full year of postpartum coverage to women on Medicaid, increasing it from just 60 days. Vice President Harris challenged all states to provide a full year of coverage; and 46 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands now do. The Administration also expanded access to maternity care coordinators for U.S. military veterans, from eight weeks to 12 months postpartum. And, it established the first-ever national maternal health and safety standards for hospitals across the country, which include requirements that hospitals have resuscitation equipment in labor and delivery rooms and proper protocols and supplies for emergency deliveries. The Administration released a blueprint outlining other federal actions to combat maternal mortality and improve maternal health. And it launched the National Maternal Mental Health Hotline which has helped tens of thousands of women. For too long, women haven’t been able to get the answers they need when it comes to their health—from cardiovascular disease to autoimmune diseases to menopause-related conditions. To pioneer the next generation of medical discoveries, the President and the First Lady launched the first-ever White House Initiative on Women’s Health Research, which aims to fundamentally change how we approach and fund women’s health research in the United States. It includes a $100 million commitment to fund the ARPA-H Sprint for Women’s Health, a $200 million National Institutes of Health-wide effort to catalyze interdisciplinary research, and more than 20 other new actions and commitments to advance women’s health research and especially research on menopause-related conditions and women’s midlife health. And President Biden signed an executive order to direct the most comprehensive set of executive actions ever taken to expand and improve research on women’s health. Democrats will continue working to address the maternal health crisis and ensure every American has access to high-quality, culturally competent care before, during, and after pregnancy. And we will continue to invest in women’s health research to galvanize new research and breakthroughs on a wide range of topics. Trump will reverse our progress. He will repeal the Affordable Care Act, putting coverage of prenatal, pregnancy, and postpartum care at risk. And he has attacked Medicaid, which covers 65 percent of births to Black mothers and 58 percent of births to Latino mothers. RACIAL EQUITY Since Day One, the Administration has championed an ambitious equity and racial justice agenda to ensure the full and fair participation of all communities in our economy and democracy, and to ensure the promise of America for everyone, including Black, Latino, and Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) Americans. Democrats are building a strong economy from the bottom up and the middle out. Black and Latino unemployment has hit record lows under President Biden, and the AANHPI employment rate is at its highest since 2008. Wages are rising faster than prices, and the greatest gains have gone to the low-paid workers. The ideal of equal opportunity is the bedrock of American democracy, but our laws, public policies, and institutions too often exacerbate disparities or deny equal opportunity to individuals and communities. President Biden signed two Executive Orders to change that, including by increasing access to federal contracting dollars, capital, and lending programs for small disadvantaged businesses; reducing discrimination in the housing market; protecting overburdened communities from environmental harms; addressing historic disinvestment and infrastructure neglect; addressing health and health care disparities; rooting out educational inequities and preserving pathways to equal opportunity; tackling persistent poverty and building economic prosperity in rural communities; promoting equity and fairness in the justice system; combating bias, discrimination and hate-based violence; and bolstering proactive enforcement that protects the civil rights of all Americans. Democrats expanded the Child Tax Credit to millions more families, slashing the child poverty rate in half to record lows, including for Black, Latino, and AANHPI children. We’ll keep fighting to make that expansion permanent. The Administration has also expanded food assistance to those in need, providing the typical low-income family of four about $2,000 more for groceries each year by improving SNAP; and it launched a summer food benefits program that serves nearly 21 million children. Democrats will keep working to increase food security, including through WIC and Summer EBT, and by bringing back the enhanced Child Tax Credit. Starting a business is part of the American Dream, and Democrats are working to make that possible for everyone, boosting access to capital and loans, and to business through government contracting work. Today, Black Americans are starting new businesses at the fastest rate in 30 years; and Latinos at the fastest rate in over a decade. Since the pandemic, the share of Black households owning a business has more than doubled, Latino business ownership is up 40 percent, and women own a record share of businesses. The Administration set a goal that 15 percent of federal contracts go to small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs) and will continue expanding these opportunities for SDBs in a second term. The Small Business Administration (SBA) has doubled the number and dollar value of loans awarded to Black-owned businesses, and doubled the rate of SBA-backed loans to Latino-owned small businesses. We eliminated the ban on SBA lending to people on probation or parole, and banned “the box” on SBA loan forms, so that people are no longer asked about their past records when applying for a loan. And, the Minority Business Development Agency, now a permanent part of the Commerce Department, is opening new offices and building partnerships with HBCUs, in its work to help minority-owned businesses across the country to overcome barriers and grow. The Administration has also increased investment in Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), and issued new licenses for nonbank lenders, helping more people in underserved communities to get capital and start businesses. As part of this work, Vice President Harris launched the Economic Opportunity Coalition bringing together major corporations and foundations to align public and private sector investments with a particular focus on driving private investment in CDFIs and MDIs. By investing in community lenders, we’re driving an estimated $130 billion more in loans to Black and Latino communities over the next decade. Going forward, we’ll double that funding for CDFIs, and expand and make permanent a New Markets Tax Credit, to encourage development in places too long left behind. The American Rescue Plan also provided $4 billion of debt forgiveness for Black and other “socially disadvantaged” farmers, a group that has endured decades of discrimination from banks and the federal government. Trump’s MAGA allies brought lawsuits, and his judicial appointees blocked that funding, but Democrats kept pushing. They secured over $5 billion in the Inflation Reduction Act to provide financial assistance to farmers, ranchers and forest landowners who've faced discrimination; and to cover loan payments for farmers in financial distress. Over $2 billion has already been distributed to more than 40,000 people. The Agriculture Department estimates that Black and underserved farmers have benefited most. The robust economic recovery that President Biden is leading is also working to close the persistent racial wealth gap that has plagued our country for generations. Today, Black wealth has climbed 60 percent since before the pandemic; Latino homeownership is higher than before the pandemic, and median Latino household wealth is up 19 percent in the last three years. Homeownership is one of the most important ways that families can build wealth. The Administration launched a first-of-its-kind task force to end pernicious bias in the home appraisal process, which has for too long undervalued Black- and Latino-owned homes. Since then, the likelihood that a home in a Black community is undervalued compared to a home in a white community has been cut by more than 40 percent. Democrats are working to bring down housing costs across the board. The American Rescue Plan kept 8 million families in their homes throughout the pandemic ; and the President has since introduced the most ambitious housing agenda in 50 years, with plans to boost supply, lower rent, and make homeownership more affordable. It includes down payment assistance for first-generation homeowners and a mortgage relief tax credit for first-time homebuyers, which will disproportionately benefit communities of color. We are also working to connect communities that have been isolated from opportunity for too long. Highways and rail lines have disproportionately torn through Black, Latino,and low-income areas; displacing and segregating residents and businesses; stifling economic growth and investment; and cutting people off from groceries, jobs, and health care. Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are righting those historic wrongs by investing in new roads, bridges, railways, and public transit and more, We know that no child’s future should be determined by their parents’ income or ZIP code. We’ve made historic investments in education in the last four years, boosting funding for Title I and community schools, investing in thousands of new school counselors and mental health providers, and supporting efforts to boost attendance and expand tutoring and summer programs. We passed the most significant gun safety law in 30 years, an important first step toward protecting all our children from the scourge of gun violence. We’re supporting students with disabilities, and working to end physical restraint and prevent discrimination, bullying, and harassment. And, where MAGA extremists are politicizing our classrooms, banning books, and trying to erase history, we are fighting back, including by appointing a federal coordinator to address the threat these bans pose to students’ civil rights. We’re also investing in recruiting and training teachers from all communities, including in partnership with HBCUs, MSIs, and TCUs; and helping them to get the pay that they deserve. It matters to children when they see someone who looks like them at the front of a classroom. Democrats are also working to make college more affordable, and to relieve the crippling burden of student debt, which disproportionately falls on students of color. Black students take on 85 percent more debt than white peers, and both Black and Latino borrowers are more likely to hold debt many years longer after graduation, deferring their dreams to buy a home, build a family, or start a business. That’s why the President’s action to cancel $167 billion in student loans for nearly five million Americans, and to ease repayment for millions of others is such an important step in leveling the playing field for everyone. To help more low-income students afford college in the first place, the Administration has also increased the maximum Pell Grant by $900, and will double it in the future. We’re expanding access to free community college; providing subsidized tuition for children from families earning less than $125,000 a year who attend HBCUs, TCUs, Hispanic- and Minority Serving Institutions. The Administration has made historic investments in those schools, as well as in registered apprenticeships, to train Americans everywhere for the careers of the future. Democrats are also committed to ending generations of environmental injustices that have left communities of color bearing the brunt of toxic pollution and climate change, decaying infrastructure, and inadequate services. The Administration is delivering on its Justice40 Initiative to deliver 40 percent of the overall benefits of our investments in infrastructure, clean energy and manufacturing investments to disadvantaged communities. Today, we’re replacing every toxic lead pipe in the country, accelerating Superfund cleanups, cracking down on polluters that have poisoned their neighborhoods air, water, and soil for too long. We’re making sure that every community benefits from home energy tax credits, low-cost solar panels, and other programs that can save families money while reducing emissions. And we’re investing in climate-resilient infrastructure that will protect every part of this country from extreme weather and other consequences of climate change. Democrats will also keep fighting to address disparities in health care and make sure every American has access to quality, affordable health care. We’ve continued to protect and expand the Affordable Care Act, expanding coverage to more Americans ever in history; and we’re taking historic steps to lower the cost of prescription drugs — like capping insulin at $35 a month and prescription drug costs at $2,000 a year for seniors — and we’ll keep fighting to expand those caps for every American. We will keep pushing to provide Medicaid-like coverage to people in states that have not expanded Medicaid, and to make it easier for parents to keep children enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP. We’ll defend all women’s right to reproductive health care. As highlighted above, we’re tackling the crisis of maternal mortality, expanding Medicaid to cover women for a full year postpartum and investing in a diverse workforce to support pregnant and postpartum women. And, we will address the disproportionate impact of infectious diseases, including HIV and Hepatitis C, and expand access to PrEP to end the HIV epidemic. We have a long way to go to realize the full promise of America, but we are committed as a party to continuing the work to build a nation where all people are not only created equal, but treated equally throughout their lives. To determine how best to right historical wrongs, Democrats support Congress executing a study of reparations and the continuing impacts of slavery. Trump’s vision for America is very different. As President, he shortchanged Black-owned businesses when it was time to hand out COVID relief funds. His tax law benefitted wealthy white Americans over everyone else. Unemployment rates soared during his presidency for people of color, while he tried to cut health care, affordable housing, and Social Security. As a real estate developer, he was sued for race-based housing discrimination and systemic violations of the Fair Housing Act, engaging in long standing racial segregation and discrimination in properties they owned and operated. Now, he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, ripping health care away from millions. He will gut President Biden’s landmark jobs, prescription drug, and climate bills, and put a crippling import tax on the everyday things people need to get by, raising costs for Black and Latino families on everything from insulin to internet to school supplies. He will increase the racial wealth gap, by cutting taxes for billionaires and big corporations while sticking working families with the bill. He will make our communities less safe: the murder rate spiked by a record during his presidency; crime is near a 50 year low under President Biden. Trump and his hand-picked courts will continue their attacks on our rights and freedoms, eroding voting rights, the freedom to protest, and freedom to make one’s own healthcare decisions. America cannot afford to go back. LGBTQI+ For generations, LGBTQI+ Americans have summoned the courage to live authentically and proudly, even when it meant putting their lives and livelihoods at risk. LGBTQI+ Americans continue to inspire and bring hope to all people seeking a life true to who they are, and to enrich every aspect of American life. But the fight for equality is far from over, as the LGBTQI+ community continues to face attacks and bigotry in states across the country. Democrats are committed to defending LGBTQI+ rights. President Biden is committed to leading the most pro-equality Administration in history. Democrats passed and President Biden signed the historic Respect for Marriage Act, enshrining marriage equality in federal law. He reversed Trump’s un-American ban on transgender servicemembers and ended the disgraceful and discriminatory ban on blood donation by gay and bisexual men. On Day One of his presidency, he signed a historic executive order extending federal nondiscrimination protections to LGBTQI+ people, and he signed executive orders strengthening civil rights protections in housing, employment, health care, education, and the justice system. He pardoned service members who had been discharged for being themselves. As president, Trump rolled back the LGBTQI+ community’s hard-fought progress. Trump gutted Obama–Biden anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQI+ Americans and banned transgender service members from serving, overruling the recommendations of military leaders and public health professionals. And, he appointed judges who oppose same-sex marriage, have sided with businesses to reject LGBTQI+ customers, and helped implement the military’s transgender ban. When a person can be married in the morning and thrown out of a restaurant for being gay in the afternoon, something is still wrong. That’s why Democrats will pass the Equality Act to codify protections for LGBTQI+ Americans and their families. We will prohibit employment discrimination in the federal government, including contractors, and make federally-funded seniors programs LGBTQI+ inclusive. And we have and will continue to make great strides in protecting LGBTQI+ children and prospective parents in the adoption and foster care systems. President Biden has delivered on his promise to ban discrimination in health care on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation. He has protected transgender Americans’ access to health care and coverage, including medically necessary gender-affirming care; and implemented a national strategy to end the HIV epidemic in this country. Democrats will build on this progress to expand mental health and suicide prevention services for LGBTQI+ people. Trump wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which will increase costs and rip away protections for LGBTQI+ Americans. That landmark law ensures LGBTQI+ people nationwide can access health care free from discrimination; helped reduce the uninsured rate among LGBTQI+ Americans and their family members; and banned insurance companies from denying care or charging more for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump’s MAGA Republican allies are also looking to target surrogacy for LGBTQI+ Americans next. As President Biden has said, LGBTQI+ youth are some of the bravest people he knows, and he has made it a priority to fight for them. The Administration is combating the dangerous and cruel practice of so-called “conversion therapy.” Democrats have invested in supporting LGBTQI+ youth mental health, including through the historic Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. President Biden has also taken action to support LGBTQI+ youth in foster care; and is fighting book bans that censor LGBTQI+ content. He signed an executive order recommitting the federal government to guarantee educational environments free from sex discrimination, including on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. He signed a historic executive order to address discriminatory legislative attacks against LGBTQI+ children and families, directing key agencies to protect families and children; safeguard health care and programs designed to prevent youth suicide; and support LGBTQI+ children and families by launching a new initiative to protect foster youth, prevent homelessness, and improve access to federal programs. And, he established the White House Task Force to Address Online Harassment and Abuse to help fight online hate that disproportionately targets LGBTQI+ people, including youth. Trump is running on an extreme plan to punish doctors who treat transgender youth and to ban gender-affirming care, and his MAGA Republican allies have pushed a tidal wave of extreme anti-LGBTQI+ bills in statehouses across the country. Democrats will vigorously oppose state and federal bans on gender-affirming health care and respect the role of parents, families, and doctors – not politicians – in making health care decisions. Democrats will continue to fight for LGBTQI+ youth by building on President Biden’s historic actions to ban so-called “conversion therapy”; protecting LGBTQI+ children from bullying and discrimination; guaranteeing that transgender students are treated fairly and with respect at school; and ending the homeless crisis among LGBTQI+ youth. LGBTQI+ Americans have long faced threats to their safety just for being who they are. President Biden launched the LGBTQI+ Community Safety Partnership to provide community safety trainings, support health care providers who serve the LGBTQI+ community, and support LGBTQI+ communities to report hate crimes, and build cross-community partnerships to address hate-fueled violence. The Justice Department is taking an all-of-department approach to protecting LGBTQI+ rights. Democrats will end violence against transgender Americans, especially Black and brown transgender women, and prioritize the investigation of hate crimes against trans and non-binary people. DISABILITY People with disabilities have long strengthened our economy and expanded our nation’s possibilities. And, groundbreaking legislation like the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act have made significant strides toward equal opportunity for people with disabilities. But there is more work to do. People with disabilities are three times less likely to have a job, and when they do, they are often paid less money for doing the same work. Democrats are taking action to fix that. President Biden signed an executive order establishing a government-wide commitment to advancing equality and equity in federal employment, including for people with disabilities. The Labor Department is protecting workers with disabilities and fighting to end unjust employment practices. The Administration is helping state and local governments, businesses, and nonprofits access federal funds to hire more disabled Americans. And President Biden is making sure his Administration looks like America, appointing people with disabilities to positions all across our government. He is making the federal government a model employer when it comes to wages, accommodations, and opportunities to advance for people with disabilities. And he’s helping young people with disabilities transition from education to employment through the Disability Innovation Fund. President Biden is also working to improve health care for people with disabilities. The Administration released a rule barring providers from denying medical treatments related to organ donations or lifesaving care for disabled Americans based on their disability alone. It launched long COVID clinical trials and created the Office of Long COVID Research and Practice. The National Institutes of Health designated people with disabilities a “health disparity population,” unlocking new resources for research. President Biden also signed an executive order increasing access to quality care and supporting caregivers; as well as historic legislation that expands home- and community-based services under Medicaid. Accessible public spaces are essential to ensuring equal opportunity for people with disabilities. Democrats have invested in accessible infrastructure, including rail station accessibility and actions to make airports and airplanes more accessible. And Democrats passed and President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which expanded access to affordable broadband, an especially important step for people with disabilities. Trump has a long record of discrimination against people with disabilities, including publicly mocking them. His business has faced a series of lawsuits for failing to comply with the ADA. Discrimination complaints from federal workers with disabilities employed at Cabinet-level agencies increased 20 percent while he was president, and in his first year in office, the number of people with disabilities fired by the government increased 24 percent, with workers with disabilities fired at almost two times the rate of workers without disabilities. Trump repeatedly proposed billions in cuts to Social Security Disability Insurance and called for restrictions on eligibility and benefit cutbacks. He called to cut funding for special education grants and eliminate federal funding for the Special Olympics. He has promised to close the Department of Education, threatening enforcement of IDEA protections for students with disabilities. And he rescinded guidance protecting students with disabilities, including guidance aimed at ensuring students with disabilities were not unfairly disciplined. Democrats will enforce laws that ensure equal opportunity for people with disabilities: the ADA, IDEA, the Fair Housing Act, the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Mental Health Parity Act, and the Help America Vote Act. We oppose efforts to weaken the ADA and build on the ACA to prevent health care discrimination. Democrats will enforce the Olmstead integration mandate and enforce non-discrimination protections in health care, employment, education, housing, voting. We will promote equitable treatment of students with disabilities so every child with disabilities can thrive. And to support people with disabilities and their families, we will support home and community-based care and end the subminimum wage. TRIBAL NATIONS President Biden’s relationship with Tribal Nations and their citizens is built on respect for Tribal sovereignty and self-governance, honoring federal trust and treaty responsibilities, protecting Tribal homelands, and conducting regular, meaningful, and robust consultation with Tribal Nations. Native communities pass down rich cultures, knowledge, traditions, and ways of life. But throughout our history, Native peoples’ cultures, identities, and governments were not always seen as a part of this Nation but as a threat to it, and they faced violence and devastation that cost countless lives, tore families apart, and caused lasting damage to Tribal communities and institutions. Despite centuries of violence and oppression, Native peoples remain resilient and proud. Today, Native Americans are essential to the fabric of the United States. Since President Biden took office, he has helped champion a new and better chapter in the story of our nation-to-nation relationships. He appointed the first Native American Secretary of the Interior, Deb Haaland, and more than 80 Native Americans hold senior Administration roles. He also relaunched Tribal Nations Summit and reestablished the White House Council on Native American Affairs. He is protecting sacred and Tribal lands, including by restoring protections for Berryessa Snow Mountain, Avi Kwa Ame, and Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments. To further tribal self-governance and usher in a new era of self-determination, he signed a historic executive order that ensures the federal government respects the nation-to-nation relationship with tribes by ensuring maximal autonomy in funding and other steps. He has invested in supporting Native families and communities: Democrats passed and President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan, which made the largest direct federal investment in Tribal Nations in history, along with additional historic funds in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. Democrats expanded the Child Tax Credit, pushing Native child poverty to a record low in 2021. We secured the first-ever advance appropriations for the Indian Health Service. And President Biden also defended the Indian Child Welfare Act and will continue doing so. For decades, Native communities have been devastated by an epidemic of disappearances and killings, too often without resolution, justice, or accountability. President Biden is taking action to address the missing and murdered Indigenous persons crisis; the Departments of Justice and the Interior working together to accelerate investigations, DOI creating a unit to work on this issue, and FBI hiring personnel to focus on these cases. After Trump failed to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, Democrats finally did and included new protections and programs to support Tribal survivors through the expansion of special criminal jurisdiction of Tribal courts. The Administration awarded $68 million in grants to support Native communities to provide services and promote justice for survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, stalking, and trafficking. His Administration has continued to implement the Not Invisible Act Commission recommendations to address violent crime and the high rates of people reported missing in Native communities and relaunched the North American Trilateral Working Group on Violence Against Indigenous Women and Girls. And the Administration has issued final fee-to-trust land acquisitions rules and changes to Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act regulations. Trump’s presidency was a disaster for Native communities. Tribal communities were disproportionately harmed by Trump’s disastrous response to the COVID pandemic, seeing higher hospitalization rates than other demographics. He worked to sabotage the ACA and will repeal it if he gets back to the White House. He tried to cut agencies and programs important to Tribal communities, like job training and business development funding and from Tribal scholarship and education programs. Democrats will continue promoting nation-to-nation partnerships with Tribal Nations. We will continue strengthening and respect for Tribal sovereignty, the federal trust responsibility, Tribal treaty rights, and Native history, including educating the federal workforce, providing best practices for sacred sites, and ensuring Native American history is recognized. Democrats will keep working to make federal resources for Tribal Nations more accessible and protect health, education, safety, and welfare in Indian Country, particularly for Native women, children, and families. We will make IHS funding mandatory. We will invest in housing in Tribal communities, and support Tribal conservation through co-stewardship of public lands and waters. We will continue to usher in the next era of Tribal self-determination. And Democrats will invest in public safety and justice, including by increasing the number of officers and investigators on the ground; address the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous persons; and supporting VAWA programs, including a new grant program to address the missing and murdered Indigenous persons crisis. COMBATING HATE & PROTECTING FREEDOM OF RELIGION As President Biden often says, certain core values bring us together as Americans — and one of them is standing together against the hate, racism, bigotry, and violence that have long haunted our nation. We can and must come together regardless of our backgrounds. President Biden and Vice President Harris have taken historic action to stand up to hate. President Biden signed the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act to finally make lynching a federal crime. He hosted the United We Stand Summit, elevating the fight against hate to the highest levels of our government. He signed COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act after AANHPI Americans faced a wave of hate during the pandemic. He has sought increased funding to improve the prevention, reporting and prosecution of hate crimes. And Democrats secured the greatest funding increase in history for bolstering the security of nonprofits, including houses of worship. President Biden has been a strong and unequivocal voice speaking out against rising antisemitism in America. The Administration released the first-ever National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, outlining a whole-of-society effort, including unprecedented, coordinated, and bold actions across government agencies, and calls to action for Congress, state and local governments, companies, technology platforms, and others. As part of that strategy, the Administration clarified, for the first time in writing, that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits certain forms of antisemitic, Islamophobic, and related discrimination, including discrimination by national origin, in federally funded programs and activities. President Biden continues to take bold action to combat antisemitism on college campuses. And he has prioritized fighting antisemitism abroad by appointing Deborah Lipstadt as U.S. Special Envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism, an ambassador-level position. President Biden knows that Islamophobia has no place in our society. Across his Administration, agencies are taking action to fight Islamophobia and support Muslim Americans. His Administration is developing the first-ever U.S. National Strategy to Counter Islamophobia and Related Forms of Bias and Discrimination, including hate against Arab, Sikh and South Asian Americans. He is the first president in history to recognize the International Day to Combat Islamophobia, and his Administration released a Dear Colleague Letter reminding schools, including institutions of higher learning, of their legal obligation under Title VI to address discrimination, including harassment, based on race, color or national origin, including discrimination against students who are or are perceived to be Muslim, Arab, Sikh, South Asian, Hindu or Palestinian based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics. Again and again, Trump has shown us who he is on the issue of hate. He rubs shoulders with and encourages white supremacists, even launching his 2024 campaign with a meeting with white supremacist, antisemite, and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes. He called white supremacist and openly-antisemitic Charlottesville protesters “very fine people.” He reportedly thinks Hitler “did some good things” and echoes his hateful rhetoric about immigrants, including that they’re “poisoning the blood of our country.” He will reinstate his disgraceful Muslim ban if he’s elected, continuing his long history of Islamophobia. And he fueled anti-Asian hate as the AANHPI community faced a spike in hate crimes surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats condemn the decades-long campaign to demonize the Muslim community and will end policies that target American Muslims as security threats. We will combat hate crimes and white nationalist terrorism. We will prioritize the investigation of hate crimes against trans and non-binary people. And we will continue to increase security at houses of worship. President Biden deeply believes everyone must be able to practice their faith without fear. That’s why Democrats will protect the First Amendment right to free exercise of religion for everyone, and we will maintain the separation of church and state. In contrast, the Trump Administration attacked religious freedom by demonizing some faiths and preferring others. We will advocate for religious freedom across the world. And, we will continue to honor both religious freedom and other civil rights, not put them at war with one another. This critical work is led by Ambassador Rashad Hussain, the first Muslim to serve as Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom. And we will continue to recognize faith communities’ acts of service, which are critical pillars of their communities. That’s one reason why President Biden reestablished the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships — so that the government can work better with faith and community groups to serve people in need. FREEDOM OF THE PRESS Freedom of the press is foundational to our nation, and President Biden is committed to safeguarding it. That’s why he has called for the immediate and unconditional release of journalists who have been locked up abroad for doing their jobs. He is taking action to combat crimes against journalists, strengthen security for independent media outlets, and provide legal support for investigative journalists around the world. And his Administration brought together a coalition to counter proliferation and misuse of commercial spyware. Democrats reject Trump’s denigration of the free press and recognize its importance to our society. We will strengthen media ownership rules and direct federal antitrust agencies to investigate media mergers, pushing back on the potentially harmful effects of corporate consolidation. And we will appoint an independent media professional to head the U.S. Agency for Global Media. ARTS & HUMANITIES America is a great nation in large part because of the power of the arts and humanities that’s embedded in the DNA of America. The Administration has taken historic action to support the arts, helping libraries, theaters, concert halls, and other venues stay afloat during the pandemic. The Administration has strengthened the National Endowment for the Arts, Institute of Museum and Library Services, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. President Biden also reestablished the President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities and signed an Executive Order to make art more accessible to people from underserved communities, elevate new voices through the arts and humanities, and expand opportunities for artists and scholars. He has celebrated and elevated the arts by hosting performances and screenings, and has awarded National Humanities Medals, National Medals of Arts, and hosted Kennedy Center honorees at the White House. Democrats value the humanities, arts and art education for developing imagination, creativity, innovation, and critical thinking, and for building bridges within and between our communities. We will promote arts funding and education — and we will invest in the arts and humanities accordingly. Democrats will fund the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and art and music education in public schools. Democrats know that federal grants for cultural organizations, artists, scholars, library systems, museums, and state and local governments only strengthen our communities and our cultural heritage. D.C., PUERTO RICO, TERRITORIES President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats have made historic investments in Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa – delivering billions for infrastructure, semiconductor, clean energy, and transportation projects, and creating thousands of good jobs. Democrats reject the unequal treatment of residents of D.C., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. territories. We unequivocally support statehood for D.C., which its residents overwhelmingly support but Republicans blocked from even getting a vote in the Senate. Democrats recognize that the people of Puerto Rico have earned and deserve to resolve the political status questions. For this reason, Democrats support the enactment of the Puerto Rico Status Act/H.R. 2757, and promote full civic and political representation for Puerto Ricans. We will work to end its unequal treatment by the federal government, and fight to provide equal access to federal programs like Medicaid, SNAP, and the CTC. Democrats reject Trump’s failed response to Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico, and will ensure that the federal government’s response to disasters in Puerto Rico is as urgent as it would be anywhere else in the country. When disaster does strike, we will speed access to recovery funds to help rebuild. We will build on the Administration’s investments to invest further in energy, infrastructure, economic development, education, health care, housing, energy, and climate resilience. We will help restructure Puerto Rico’s debt to relieve its debt burden, and we will work to dissolve the Financial Oversight and Management Board. Democrats also support self-determination for the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa. We will create a Congressional task force to study equal voting rights and House representation; and we will work to ensure equal access to federal programs like veterans’ benefits, the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, and SNAP food assistance for all those eligible. Democrats support funding to improve critical health care facilities in the territories, including construction of a state-of-the-art medical complex in Guam that co-locates health agencies on a single campus for a more integrated healthcare system that will benefit the region. We will also invest in ending disparities in agriculture, economic development, education, employment, energy, health care, housing, and infrastructure, and help the U.S. territories diversify their economies. We will help them recover from natural disasters, and we will invest in expanding clean energy and water systems to be more resilient. Democrats support reimbursing U.S. territories for more migration costs, including restoring Medicaid eligibility for legal migrants under the Compacts of Free Association. And Democrats will continue to recognize the sacrifices and honor the contributions of residents who suffered because of their U.S. nationality during the Japanese occupation during World War II. Democrats also recognize that millions of U.S. citizens live abroad, and we will consider their unique circumstances and challenges when shaping policy. We will work to protect their voting rights and ensure they’re able to participate in the democratic process here at home. Chapter Seven: Securing our Border & Fixing the Broken Immigration System Since our founding, immigrants have traveled to America to pursue freedom and opportunity, to flee oppression, and to reunite with family members, and in turn have made our country stronger. President Biden has led with the conviction that we must secure our border and fix a broken immigration system decades in the making. Through it all, the United States must continue to be a beacon of hope and opportunity. On his first day in office, President Biden sent Congress legislation to secure our border, fix our immigration system, and provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and others. This past year, the President worked across the aisle and negotiated a bipartisan deal that included the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border in decades. It would have made our country safer and made our border more secure, while treating people fairly and humanely and expanding legal immigration, consistent with our values as a nation. Congress failed to act because Republicans, led by Donald Trump, would rather play politics than solve problems. Trump’s plans for a second term will devastate our economy and tear families apart. Trump has said that if he’s elected, he’ll move to immediately deport millions of undocumented immigrants, including those who have lived in and contributed to this country for years. He and his allies have also promised to end birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented individuals, ignore the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent and bar undocumented children from public schools, and once again separate children from their families. Trump’s plans are out of line with American values, and Congressional Republicans are currently blocking President Biden’s bipartisan border security proposals because they lack the courage to stand up to Trump. President Biden has led a hemispheric response to the challenge of irregular migration, launching and leading the Los Angeles Declaration for Migration and Protection with 20 countries to increase enforcement, expand legal pathways to citizenship, and stabilize and integrate migrants in neighboring countries. President Biden has taken decisive action to secure our border through executive actions that have significantly restricted eligibility for asylum at the border and created innovative legal pathways to the U.S. that, when coupled with strong enforcement, have decreased illegal border crossings. Since President Biden announced new border restrictions in June 2024, the number of unlawful crossings has fallen by 40 percent, demonstrating that the policy works. He has also implemented policies that have stopped record amounts of fentanyl from crossing our border. President Biden has done all of this while ensuring that people are treated humanely and with dignity. As one of his first actions, President Biden established the Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families, which as of March 2024 has reunited nearly 800 children with their parents in the United States that were separated in Trump’s presidency. In President Biden’s second term, he will push Congress to pass legislation that is consistent with our values as a nation. Legislation must secure the border, reform the asylum system, expand legal immigration; and keep families together by supporting a pathway for long-term undocumented individuals, improving the work authorization process, and securing the future of the DACA program. President Biden has taken action to advance each of these goals, but lasting, comprehensive reforms require congressional action. SECURING THE BORDER The President has already taken steps to increase border resources, working within the limits imposed by Congress. He has increased the number of agents and officers on the southwest border to over 24,000, added thousands of additional support personnel, surged thousands of law enforcement and other personnel from across the Department of Homeland Security, and secured the first significant increase of Border Patrol agents in more than a decade. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law modernized border stations and land border ports of entry. The Administration is providing support to cities and states, on the border and across the country, that are sheltering migrants. He has also taken executive actions, including launching expedited immigration court dockets, to more quickly resolve immigration cases for those crossing the Southern border and remove those who do not establish a legal basis to remain. President Biden has repeatedly asked Congress for additional resources to secure our border, including increases for personnel that are critically needed to quickly deliver consequences at the border to those who cross unlawfully. The Department of Homeland Security requested funds to hire 1,300 Border Patrol agents and 1,600 asylum officers. Meanwhile, the bipartisan Senate bill would have provided an additional 1,500 Customs and Border Protection personnel and 4,300 asylum officers. Congressional Republicans continue to play partisan politics with the security of our border instead of working with Democrats to fund these critically needed resources for DHS and border communities. In President Biden's second term, he will push Congress to provide the resources and authorities that we need to secure the border. This includes additional border patrol agents, immigration judges, asylum officers, cutting-edge inspection machines to help detect and stop the flow of fentanyl, and funding for cities and states that are sheltering migrants. Reform the Asylum System Congress must pass legislation to reform our asylum system modeled after the bipartisan Senate deal so that we can quickly identify and provide protection to those who are fleeing persecution and ensure it is not used as an alternative to legal immigration by others. Democrats believe that asylum processing should be efficient and fair, and that those who are determined not to have a legal basis to remain should be quickly removed. In order to achieve this, we need Congress to strengthen requirements for valid asylum claims. Congress must also finally fund a sufficient number of asylum officers and immigration judges to facilitate timely decisions. In addition, asylum seekers, especially the most vulnerable, including unaccompanied children, should have access to legal counsel. Individuals who pass this strengthened initial screening and are determined to be likely to qualify for asylum should be given quick access to work authorization while they go through a streamlined court process. After Congress repeatedly failed to act, President Biden announced executive action that significantly curtailed asylum eligibility at the border when crossings reach a certain threshold and strengthened our ability to impose timely consequences for crossing the border illegally. Those who attempt to cross into the United States unlawfully are being quickly returned to their home countries, as well as Mexico. Since the President took this action, unlawful entries between ports of entry declined by more than half. And, President Biden is changing the asylum process to more quickly screen and identify individuals who pose a threat to national security or public safety so that they can be swiftly removed. Temporary Emergency Authority to Shut Down the Border When the system is overwhelmed, the President should have emergency authority to expel migrants who are crossing unlawfully and stop processing asylum claims except for those using a safe and orderly process at Ports of Entry. The authority should be accompanied by humanitarian exceptions for vulnerable populations including unaccompanied children and victims of trafficking. Congress should also dedicate resources to detain and remove individuals quickly, and rapidly process those who cannot be detained in a non-custodial setting under government supervision. Those who pose a threat to public safety or national security must be identified and removed as quickly as possible. Fighting Human Trafficking We need more resources and Congressional authorization to increase penalties to prosecute and punish human smugglers and traffickers who prey upon families and migrants. President Bid en has already taken numerous steps to go after these bad actors including by revoking the visas of private sector CEOs and sanctioning government officials who profit from migrants coming to the U.S. unlawfully, and by expanding efforts to dismantle human smuggling and prosecute offenders. President Biden also established Joint Task Force Alpha, a law enforcement task force that marshals the investigative and prosecutorial resources of the Department of Justice, in partnership with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), to enhance U.S. enforcement efforts against the most prolific and dangerous human smuggling and trafficking groups operating in Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. Joint Task Force Alpha has delivered significant results, including: over 240 U.S. convictions against leaders, organizers, and significant facilitators of human trafficking and substantial seizures and forfeitures of assets including cash, property, and firearms. Cracking Down on Trafficking Illicit Fentanyl President Biden has made fighting the trafficking of fentanyl a top priority. He has seized record amounts of fentanyl at our border— and arrested more individuals for fentanyl-related crimes in the last two years than in the previous five years combined— and secured funding for more cutting-edge inspection machines to help detect fentanyl at our southwest border. He also issued an Executive Order to go after the global illicit fentanyl trade, which led to the imposition of sanctions on some 300 persons and entities. President Biden has also continued working with Mexico to extradite and prosecute key fentanyl traffickers, and negotiated the resumption of bilateral cooperation on counternarcotics with China, which had been stalled since 2019. As a result of these efforts, the number of fentanyl-related deaths has started to decline for the first time in five years. In his second term, President Biden will work with Congress to deploy more cutting-edge inspection machines to help detect fentanyl at our ports of entry. He will also leverage all resources of the federal government to stop tech platforms from being used for criminal conduct, including sales of dangerous drugs like fentanyl. EXPANDING LEGAL IMMIGRATION & DETERRING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION America is a nation of immigrants. The legal immigration framework was last updated in 1990 and does not reflect the needs of our country in the 21st century. Many immigrants today are forced to wait years, and often decades, to immigrate lawfully to the United States. A robust immigration system with accessible lawful pathways and penalties for illegal immigration alleviates pressure at the border and upholds our values. The U.S. Citizenship Act would permanently increase family-sponsored and employment-based immigration. The bipartisan border legislation would increase the number of immigrant visas that are available by 250,000 over 5 years. Legal Immigration Pathways While we wait for Congress to act, President Biden has used his authority to provide orderly, legal immigration pathways for those fleeing violence, and decrease the number of illegal border crossings. The Biden-Harris Administration established a humanitarian parole process for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans (CHNV), which allows people from these four countries who have a sponsor in the U.S. and who pass a background check to come to the U.S. for a period of two years to live and work lawfully. Border encounters from these nationalities decreased by 89 percent in the first six months after CHNV was put in place —incentivizing migrants to stay in place, rather than make the dangerous journey to our southwest border. He also established New Family Reunification Parole Processes to allow eligible individuals from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia, Cuba and Haiti to be reunited with family in the United States while they wait to complete the process for securing lawful permanent residence. The United States has long been a leader in refugee resettlement, providing a beacon of hope for persecuted people around the world, facilitating international efforts to address record displacement, and demonstrating the generosity and core values of the American people. After Trump decimated the program, President Biden rebuilt the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, which is now on track to admit more than 100,000 refugees this fiscal year, the most in three decades. The Administration also established Safe Mobility Offices in countries throughout the Western hemisphere, where migrants can be processed for refugee admission or referred to resettlement programs elsewhere - rather than making their way to our border. And, the Administration expanded opportunities for communities and individual Americans to sponsor and welcome refugees to the United States. President Biden has worked closely with partners throughout the region – including, most importantly, the government of Mexico – to undertake coordinated actions to stop the flow of migrants before they reach our border. And he has supported our regional partners through the LA Declaration process – working together on coordinated enforcement, development of lawful pathways, and efforts to address the root causes of migration. As outlined in the U.S. Citizenship Act, Congress must act to increase the number of family-sponsored and employment-based immigrant visas that are available each fiscal year so that people aren’t forced to wait decades for a visa. Legislation should also include provisions to ensure that children who came as dependents on their parents’ temporary visas can remain in the United States with their families, even after turning 21, provisions to streamline applications of at-risk Afghan allies to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, and a process for Afghan evacuees to have their status adjusted to lawful permanent resident. Legislation should also extend work authorization to those who utilize lawful visa pathways so that families can more quickly get on the path to economic self-sufficiency. This includes K-1, K-2, and K-3 nonimmigrant visa holders (fiancés, spouses, children of U.S. citizens), and the spouses and children of high-skilled temporary visa holders. And, Democrats will explore opportunities to identify or create work permits for immigrants, long-term undocumented residents, and legally processed asylum seekers in our country. Congress should also increase the number of visas for the Special Immigrant Juvenile Status program for abused, abandoned, or neglected youth, building on actions that the Administration has already taken to provide deferred action and work authorization for juveniles in this program. Keeping Families Together and Supporting Long-Term Undocumented Individuals, including Dreamers In 2012, then-Vice President Biden worked alongside President Obama to establish the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Since then, President Biden has taken steps to support undocumented people and families, including Dreamers and DACA recipients. President Biden has vigorously defended DACA against legal challenges in the courts, and has extended Affordable Care Act coverage to DACA recipients for the first time. In addition, President Biden is taking action to make it easier for Dreamers, including DACA recipients, who have earned a higher education degree in the United States and have a job offer to more quickly receive work visas. And, the Administration allowed undocumented workers in labor disputes to apply for deferred action so that they are not afraid to report violations of labor law. Trump tried to end the DACA program in his first term and will do so again if re-elected. President Biden also announced new actions to keep an estimated 500,000 American families together by allowing certain noncitizen spouses and children of U.S. citizens who have been in the country for 10 years or more to apply for lawful permanent residence —a status they’re already eligible for —without leaving the country first. The average beneficiary has been in the United States for more than 20 years, and will finally be able to come out of the shadows and fully contribute to our communities. President Biden has also taken steps to preserve and expand Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for individuals from countries experiencing armed conflicts, natural disasters, or other crises, giving thousands authorization to live and work in the United States without fear of deportation for a temporary period. Since 2021, DHS – which oversees the program – has added Afghanistan, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Myanmar, Ukraine and Venezuela to the list of TPS-eligible countries. DHS has also extended TPS for immigrants from most countries that were already covered by TPS, including the countries that Trump attempted to terminate. Congress must pass legislation to provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, farmworkers, careworkers, and other long-term undocumented individuals who contribute to this country, by paying taxes and contributing to their local economies, and in his second term, President Biden will continue pressing them to do so. Fast, Efficient Immigration Decisions Immigration officers have to make the right decisions, and they also have to make them quickly and efficiently. Under the Administration, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has cut processing times significantly for those awaiting work authorizatio n and ensured that immigration decisions – including naturalization and work permit applications – are made fairly and as quickly as possible. As of April 2024, the Administration achieved the lowest wait time for naturalization since 2016 and the lowest wait time for work authorization documents from certain categories of applicants since 2017. In FY 2023, USCIS administered the oath of allegiance to more than 878,500 new U.S. citizens, including 12,000 members of the military, effectively eliminating the backlog of naturalization applications. It also reduced the median processing time for naturalization from 10.5 months to 6.1 months. The Administration has also partnered with state governments and non-profit groups to host Work Authorization Clinics, which have eased the burden on American communities by helping migrants support their families and move out of emergency shelter into more stable housing options. It will also help to fund community-based organizations that host clinics to assist with immigration cases. To make scheduling appointments at U.S. ports of entry safer and more orderly, the Administration launched CBPOne, a free online tool available to migrants in parts of Mexico. Scheduling appointments makes the process at our border safer and more orderly, and the advance information that is submitted to CBP creates a more efficient and streamlined process for CBP and for individuals. CBPOne has increased administrative processing capacity fivefold since its introduction. Chapter Eight: Advancing the President’s Unity Agenda Since the day he took office, President Biden promised to be a president for all Americans. He knows that we agree on a lot more than we disagree on. During his first State of the Union, President Biden outlined a unity agenda to make progress solving big challenges that Americans have in common: beating the opioid epidemic, tackling the mental health crisis, holding Big Tech accountable, ending cancer as we know it, and meeting our nation’s sacred obligation to veterans. Under President Biden’s leadership, Democrats worked across the aisle to make real progress on these critical issues. We’re providing life-saving treatment for opioid use disorder to end the epidemic, making historic investments in mental health care to help struggling Americans, establishing new high standards for AI safety and protecting American privacy, bringing together providers, insurers, and researchers to work toward ending cancer, and passed the PACT Act to expand health care benefits to veterans. Donald Trump divides us for his own political gain. He refuses to reach across the aisle to deliver results for working families, and he will cut veterans’ benefits, mental health care for kids, opioid treatment, and cancer research. BEATING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC For too long, the scourge of opioids has torn through our communities, ripping apart families and shattering lives. Our nation’s opioid epidemic impacts Americans in every corner of the country, from small towns to large cities to Tribal lands. Far too many Americans have lost loved ones to addiction and overdose. The Biden-Harris Administration is strengthening prevention, investing in treatment, and expanding recovery support services. The Administration has increased the number of medical providers who can initiate treatment from 129,000 to 2 million and made historic investments in the State Opioid Response program to help states deliver free treatment services to over 1.2 million people and enabled States to reverse more than 500,000 overdoses. To curb opioid overdoses, the Administration is making naloxone, an overdose-prevention drug, available over-the-counter at grocery stores and pharmacies. They also took steps to increase access to naloxone at federal facilities, and ended a requirement for length of addiction before entering treatment. Democrats will continue these critical investments in life-saving medication and care for Americans struggling with addiction and most at risk of overdose. As president, Trump failed to mount an effective and coherent strategy to prevent overdoses. Under his watch, opioid-related deaths spiked, and now, he’s promising once again to repeal the Affordable Care Act. If he’s allowed back in the White House, many Americans who struggle with addiction will lose critical, live-saving health care. INVESTING IN MENTAL HEALTH The pandemic exacerbated feelings of sadness, isolation, and loneliness across the country and strained our health care system, including mental health services. President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats know mental health care is health care. For millions of Americans, that essential mental health care is out of reach. In 2020, less than half of all adults with a mental illness diagnosis received care for it and it’s worse for kids – nearly 70 percent of children who need mental health care cannot get it. That’s why Democrats are taking steps to dramatically expand access to mental health care in America. The Administration launched 988,the National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, which has connected nearly 10 million Americans in crisis to immediate, confidential, and free support from trained counselors. And, the National Maternal Mental Health Hotline has received more than 30,000 calls and texts, to help mothers and their loved ones navigate mental health issues. Democrats will push to expand 988 to handle increased capacity and serve more Americans. At the same time, we must make it easier for all Americans to access high-quality mental health and substance use treatment by recruiting and training more professionals to deliver culturally and linguistically competent, high-quality behavioral health care; and by strengthening coverage across all health plans. And we must extend workforce development and incentive programs. The Administration is delivering $1 billion to hire or train 14,000 school-based mental health counselors – the largest investment in school-based mental health in history – thanks to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. And, it is delivering additional resources to support students who need mental health care. As mental health care becomes increasingly expensive, Democrats are pushing for permanent funding for Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics, which provide 24/7 crisis care and treatment for mental health and substance use disorders, regardless of individuals’ ability to pay. And, the President is calling for additional resources to connect more Americans to affordable care at work and at school. President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats are working to ensure full mental health parity so that mental health care is covered the same as physical health care. We’re strengthening mental health parity requirements and closing insurance loopholes for the more than 150 million Americans with private health insurance. And, the President is calling on Congress to expand Medicare’s coverage for mental health care, applying the same parity protections to Medicare beneficiaries. Trump has a different vision. When he was president, he proposed cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and rollbacks of mental health funding. PROTECTING KIDS ONLINE, STRENGTHENING AMERICANS’ DATA PRIVACY, & PROMOTING COMPETITION Tech platforms and companies help keep us connected, inspire ideas and innovation, and create a global marketplace. At the same time, they collect, share, and exploit data; risk our children’s mental health; and deepen extremism and polarization. There is growing scientific evidence for what so many Americans already know: Social media and other online platforms can affect our mental health and well-being – particularly for our kids. In addition, a handful of dominant tech platforms and companies increasingly control much of the market, allowing them to exercise enormous power over Americans’ daily lives – and, too often, use that power to exclude competitors and undermine consumers and innovation. President Biden believes that all companies, including technology companies, should be held accountable for the harm they cause. The president has raised the alarm that social media and other platforms have allowed abusive and even criminal conduct like cyberstalking, child sexual exploitation, and non-consensual intimate images to proliferate on their sites – and called on Democrats and Republicans to unite on legislation to address these issues. The Surgeon General issued an advisory warning about the impacts of social media on youth mental health, noting that he cannot conclude social media is safe for children and adolescents. Democrats will pass bipartisan legislation to protect kids' privacy and to stop Big Tech from collecting personal data on kids and teenagers online, ban targeted advertising to children, and put stricter limits on the personal data these companies collect on all of us. And, the Administration has strengthened legal protections for survivors and victims of non-consensual intimate imagery, including those generated by AI, building on the federal civil cause of action established under the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization of 2022. President Biden has also called on Democrats and Republicans to pass bipartisan legislation to promote competition and privacy in the tech industry. Important policies include promoting interoperability between tech services and platforms, allowing users to control and transfer their data, and preventing large platforms from giving their own products and services an unfair advantage in the marketplace. We must also fundamentally reform Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields tech platforms from liability even when they host or disseminate violent or illegal content, to ensure that platforms take responsibility for the content they share. Democrats are determined to strengthen data privacy. The President issued an Executive Order to protect America’s sensitive personal data from commercial data brokers, identity thieves, and foreign intelligence actors. And, the Federal Trade Commission is cracking down on commercial surveillance and taking on technology companies for illegally retaining children’s data. We must do more and update and pass the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, protect student data privacy by ensuring what is collected in schools is only used for education, and update the Electronic Communications Privacy Act to protect personal electronic information and safeguard location information. Seizing the Promise and Managing the Risks of AI Artificial intelligence (AI) holds extraordinary potential for both promise and peril. While AI is helping to cure diseases, predict the weather, and transform education, it’s also being used to clone voices, commit fraud, institutionalize bias, and undermine democracy. We need to act now and act fast to realize the promise of AI and manage its risks to ensure that AI serves the public interest. Democrats are finding solutions to make sure that as AI’s capabilities grow, we can manage the implications for Americans’ rights, safety and security. President Biden issued a landmark Executive Order directing federal agencies to establish new high standards for AI safety and security, protect Americans’ privacy, advance equity and civil rights, stand up for workers and consumers, promote competitive markets for AI development and use, and more. Democrats are committed to ensuring that workers get a voice in how AI is used in their workplace and that they share fairly in any economic gains AI produces. We know that AI can deepen discrimination, bias, and other abuses in justice, health care, education, and housing. That’s why the Administration has already taken action by publishing the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and issuing new guidance from federal agencies on combating algorithmic discrimination across the economy. As AI becomes more prevalent, it’s critical we have the brightest minds working to understand new technologies. The Administration launched an AI Talent Surge to accelerate hiring AI professionals across the federal government, launched a pilot program to enhance successful initiatives for training additional scientists in AI, and created the AI Safety Institute at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to set rigorous standards for extensive testing of powerful AI models to ensure safety before public release. During President Biden’s second term, Democrats will continue to advocate for the safe and secure development of AI. We will invest in the AI Safety Institute to create guidelines, tools, benchmarks, and best practices for evaluating dangerous capabilities and mitigating AI risk. We will also prioritize funding for critical AI research and development that advances AI safety. We will also ban voice impersonations, and President Biden will take action to provide heightened protections in critical sectors such as health care, financial services, education, housing, and transportation. Finally, we will make sure that we responsibly develop, test, procure, integrate transformative AI across the federal government. ENDING CANCER AS WE KNOW IT Cancer has touched nearly every single American family. As we honor the enormous courage and strength of the millions of Americans facing the disease, we're working to end cancer as we know it and get patients and families the quality care and support that they deserve. The president and first lady re-launched the Cancer Moonshot in 2022 to reduce the nation’s cancer death rate by at least half and improve the experience of people who are touched by cancer. The Cancer Moonshot has already announced more than 95 new programs, policies, and resources, including commitments from seven leading insurance companies to reimburse for navigation services, new actions from 40 comprehensive cancer centers and community oncology practices to bring effective navigation support to underserved communities, and established insurance codes so practices, including Medicare providers, have a way to bill for patient navigation services. The Administration launched the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), which is supercharging high-impact research and development to improve American health outcomes and deliver breakthroughs on cancer. President Biden is calling on the private sector to develop and test new treatments, make drugs more affordable, and share more data and knowledge that can inform the public and benefit every company’s research. We’re supporting these initiatives by providing funds to essential programs for cancer research and health care like the National Cancer Institute (NCI), FDA, Center of Disease Control (CDC), Veterans Affairs (VA), Indian Health Service (IHS), and ARPA-H. Trump will set back our progress finding treatments for cancer and other diseases - he proposed cutting funding for critical scientific research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). And, he and Republicans loosened regulations to get rid of toxic chemicals that cause cancer and made it easier for chemical companies to poison our air, water, and land. With a second term in office, President Biden will continue to work to prevent cancer, detect it early, deliver innovation, care for families facing cancer, and, ultimately, end cancer as we know it. MEETING OUR NATION’S SACRED OBLIGATION TO VETERANS AND MILITARY FAMILIES President Biden believes that our nation has no more sacred obligation than providing for our military service members when they’re sent into harm’s way and caring for them and their families after they come home. Trump called members of the military who died in war “suckers” and “losers.” He disparages the brave men and women who wear our uniform and protect our democracy and national security. And, as president, he pushed to cut funding for veterans’ benefits. President Biden signed into law more than 30 bipartisan bills addressing critical issues facing veterans, service members, and families today. He signed the PACT Act – the most significant expansion of health care benefits and services for veterans in more than 30 years – which expands VA eligibility and services to veterans who were exposed to toxic substances. Thanks to the PACT Act, more than 888,000 veterans and survivors are now receiving new service-connected disability benefits, making care and benefits available to veterans battling over 300 medical conditions. Democrats are also taking steps to support veterans’ mental health and decrease the scourge of veteran suicides by expanding mental health screenings, increasing access to legal and financial support, and hiring more mental health professionals at the VA. President Biden took historic action to end sexual assault and domestic violence in the military by calling for the establishment of the Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault and then implementing the Commission’s recommendations to better protect survivors. The Administration will prioritize the effective implementation of the Military Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act, including by successfully operating the Offices of Special Trial Counsel within the military services branches, and the Office of the Chief Prosecutor of the U.S. Coast Guard. We’re also taking steps to boost access to affordable and stable housing for all veterans, who often face a high risk of homelessness, with a focus on women veterans. Last year alone, the VA helped more than 145,000 veterans and their families stay in their homes and permanently housed more than 46,000 veterans. The Administration awarded more than $1 billion in grant funding to help homeless veterans and house their families and launched a first-of-its-kind funding for legal services for veterans experiencing or at risk of homelessness to support accessing government benefits, navigating family law, ensuring access to safe housing, and assisting with debt. The Veteran Scam and Fraud Evasion (VSAFE) Task Force has cracked down on scams targeting veterans, and the new National Veterans Financial Resource Center has promoted financial stability, literacy, and debt management for veterans. The VA is making it easier and faster for veterans to get their VA medical debt forgiven. Our commitment to our veterans and military members extends to those who care for and support them. That’s why President Biden signed an Executive Order to help military spouses obtain and maintain careers in the federal government. The Department of Defense and the Department of State also took action to ensure military spouses can keep their federal jobs when their loved ones are stationed overseas. President Biden has made child care more affordable and accessible for military families, and signed an executive order providing financial support for military-connected caregivers. Going forward, we will continue to implement the PACT Act; and we will strengthen VA care by fully funding inpatient and outpatient care and long-term care, and by upgrading medical facility infrastructure. We will also improve and increase access to mental health care, expand suicide prevention, and invest in opioid overdose prevention and treatment. Democrats are also determined to expand women veterans’ health care and access to benefits, and to continue implementing key Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault recommendations. With a second term in office and a majority in Congress, we will fulfill our promise to end veteran homelessness and support military students with disabilities. Democrats will strengthen their support for military families by making child care more affordable and accessible, expanding job opportunities for spouses, and investing in a stipend for caregivers. We will also continue implementing the military spouse Executive Order and ensure the federal government is an employer of choice for military families. In recognition of our nation’s greatest heroes, we will expand memorial benefits to honor their years of service and lasting memories. Chapter Nine: Strengthening American Leadership Worldwide We live in a period of significant global change. The world is at an inflection point between those who argue that autocracy – rule by dictators or single leaders – is the answer to facing today’s challenges and those who understand that democracy – rule by the people – is essential to moving our world forward and uplifting people everywhere. President Biden believes at this decisive moment we must demonstrate that democracy can still deliver for our people. We must rally the world to address the challenges that impact all of us, from climate change and global health to human rights, technology, food security, and inclusive economic growth. The challenges of the current moment require us to revisit old assumptions and invest in new sources of American power. We have seen aggression from authoritarian powers, the destabilizing impact of a global pandemic, the growing existential danger of the climate crisis, the awesome power of emerging technologies, and the shared vulnerabilities that underlie the 21st century global economy. Most importantly, these challenges underscore how lives and livelihoods across the world are increasingly interdependent. For too long, American foreign policy was conducted as if our domestic challenges were disconnected from global ones. President Biden understands that the two go hand-in-hand, and that leading abroad means being strong and resilient at home. He also knows that the United States is strongest when our partners are strong too. That’s why he has met the challenges of his first term – including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the existential threat of climate change, and intense strategic competition with China – by leading coalitions of nations who share our values to stand together. Donald Trump made America less safe by significantly straining U.S. alliances and emboldening autocratic regimes, while weakening global democratic norms. He insulted our allies and withdrew from international agreements and organizations that were in the national security interest. Trump praises dictators, including Vladimir Putin, and attempted to weaken the NATO alliance. And, he repeatedly disrespected the brave men and women in the U.S. military. When he entered office, President Biden moved to quickly and decisively repair the damage that Trump had done to America’s relationships with our allies and our reputation around the world. Trump’s America first strategy meant America was alone, less secure, less prosperous, and with American leadership and values falling behind worldwide. By reinvesting in America’s manufacturing base, leveling the playing field for American workers, and standing alongside our allies to support democracies and push back against autocracy, President Biden has bolstered our national security and is investing in a future where America will continue to lead on the world stage. EUROPE During President Biden’s first term, no region of the world has better illustrated the importance of our alliances than Europe. When Vladimir Putin launched his reckless war of aggression against Ukraine, he sought to shake the very foundations of the free world. He thought he could roll into Ukraine and that Ukraine and the world would roll over. He was wrong. Instead, he met the determination of the Ukrainian people. He also enhanced the resolve of NATO, the greatest military alliance in the history of the world, led by the United States. Under President Biden’s leadership, the United States has been steadfast in standing alongside our European allies to defend principles of sovereignty, deter further Russian aggression, protect our shared values, and make critical investments to ensure the security of the United States and our transatlantic allies in the years to come. President Biden has pursued three core objectives in Ukraine: help Ukraine defend its sovereignty, maintain unity in our transatlantic alliances, and prevent escalation into direct conflict with Russia. On all three fronts, the United States has succeeded. Under President Biden’s leadership, America has provided Ukraine with the weapons as well as the diplomatic and economic support needed to defend its sovereignty from Russian aggression. That work has created good paying American jobs as we build the arsenal to defend ourselves at home and help protect democracy abroad. Alongside our allies, the United States has rallied a coalition of approximately 50 nations to provide much needed security assistance to Ukraine and coordinated unprecedented international actions to impose tough sanctions on Russia and hold Putin accountable on the world stage. The Biden-Harris Administration has also helped protect Ukraine’s civilian population and energy infrastructure from unprovoked Russian attacks and worked to resume trade of Ukrainian agricultural products to support global food security. Under President Biden’s leadership, NATO is stronger and more united than ever and has bolstered its ranks by adding two highly capable allies: Sweden and Finland. NATO nations are meeting their financial commitments as well, with 23 NATO countries on track to meet a spending target of 2 percent of GDP on defense in 2024 – up from 9 countries in 2020. President Biden has also made clear that he considers the 2 percent goal to be a floor not a ceiling, and he continues to press the alliance to do even more to bolster collective defenses. More broadly, the Administration has deepened cooperation with Europe to confront a range of shared challenges. President Biden has worked with our European allies to manage competition with China, resolve disputes between America and the European Union, and address long-standing conflicts in the Balkans and Caucasus and persistent trade issues across the continent. The US-EU Trade and Technology Council has established rules of the road on global economic and technology issues. The United States and United Kingdom AI Safety Institutes have agreed on a common approach to developing artificial intelligence safely. And President Biden has led the development of the US-EU Energy Council to counter the effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. President Biden has also been willing to lead where other Presidents have not, becoming the first President to recognize the Armenian genocide. The threat posed by Russia transcends its war of aggression in Ukraine. Russia is enlisting North Korea, Iran and China in its efforts to attack freedom across the world through military equipment sales and economic partnerships. By strengthening our alliances in Europe and Indo-Pacific, and strengthening the connections among our allies, including by inviting our Indo-Pacific allies to participate in the NATO Summits in Madrid, Vilnius, and Washington, DC, the United States is countering Russia’s disruptive actions no matter where they occur. Where President Biden has made strengthening and reassuring our allies a priority, Trump has repeatedly threatened to withdraw America from the world’s most powerful military alliance and has invited Vladimir Putin to “do whatever the hell he wants” to any NATO country. While President Biden has always stood by Ukraine, Trump attempted to help his own political prospects by extorting President Zelenskyy – including by withholding much needed security assistance. And, now behind closed doors, Trump is supporting a policy of pushing Ukraine to surrender sovereign territory to Putin. President Biden will never turn his back on our allies. In his second term, he will continue to stand with Ukraine to stop Putin’s atrocities and constrain Russia’s threat to allied nations and America’s vital interests. In addition to continuing to strengthen NATO, he will help Ukraine recover economically and support ongoing efforts to strengthen Ukraine’s democracy and deepen its political and economic relationship with European and transatlantic institutions. President Biden will continue to work closely with the EU on emerging political and economic challenges and work with our European and Indo-Pacific allies to disrupt Russia’s emerging military and economic alliances with Iran and North Korea. INDO-PACIFIC The United States is an Indo-Pacific power. The region, stretching from our Pacific coastline to the Indian Ocean, is home to more than half of the world’s people, nearly two-thirds of the world’s economy, and seven of the world’s largest militaries. In the years ahead, as the region drives as much as two-thirds of global economic growth, its influence will only grow – as will its importance to the United States. President Biden understands that standing up for the rules of the road in the Indo-Pacific, and standing by our allies, makes us safer. That is why he has maintained a commitment to freedom of navigation across the Indo-Pacific, standing with the Philippines and other allies and partners to push back against hostile actions and coercion by China. He also worked to expand our military presence in Japan and secure access to strategic sites in the Philippines through a new defense cooperation agreement – steps that will help deter future regional aggression. Across the Indo-Pacific, President Biden has prioritized strengthening key multilateral partnerships. He elevated the Quad – which brings together the democratic strength of the United States, Australia, India, and Japan – to unleash new forms of regional cooperation on technology, climate, health, and maritime security. He founded AUKUS – a partnership among the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia – to better integrate the defense industrial bases of two of our closest allies and to produce conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines and increase cooperation on advanced capabilities such as artificial intelligence, autonomous platforms, and electronic warfare. Under President Biden’s leadership, the United States hosted a historic trilateral Camp David Summit with Japan and South Korea, enshrined the Washington Declaration with South Korea, and extended trilateral deterrence discussions with Japan. The Administration has elevated our relationships with Vietnam, Indonesia, and ASEAN to Comprehensive Strategic Partnerships. It has intensified our engagement with vital regional fora in the Indo-Pacific, including hosting the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum and ASEAN nations for face-to-face summits in Washington, DC, and hosting the 2023 APEC Summit in San Francisco. President Biden is also investing in a twenty-first-century partnership between the United States and India that builds technology into the fabric of our cooperation through programs such as the U.S.-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology. President Biden has also worked alongside our allies to counter the threat posed by North Korea’s destabilizing development of nuclear and missile programs, in violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions. By bolstering our trilateral cooperation with South Korea and Japan, we are maintaining peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and beyond. Trump took a different approach in the region, embarrassing the United States on the world stage including by flattering and legitimizing Kim Jong Un, exchanging “love letters” with the North Korean dictator. Trump directly threatened our valued ally South Korea with the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed there over a trade dispute. President Biden has and will stand by our allies, especially South Korea, against North Korea’s provocations, including its illegal build-up of missile capabilities. In his second term, President Biden will continue to promote a free, open, connected, prosperous, secure, and resilient Indo-Pacific. He will deepen economic engagement to drive inclusive growth. He will champion human rights. And he will continue to strengthen our traditional alliances and broaden regional partnerships to bolster deterrence and resist coercion. CHINA President Biden recognizes that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is America’s most consequential strategic competitor. The PRC is the only global actor that combines the intention to fundamentally reshape the U.S.-led international order with an increasing military, economic, diplomatic, and technological capacity to do so. President Biden understands the imperative of rising to this challenge while managing the competition between our countries responsibly. President Biden has invested in our strengths at home and our alliances abroad to compete vigorously with China, but we do not seek conflict. He has maintained a steadfast commitment to being tough but smart towards the PRC, relentlessly advancing U.S. interests and values while ensuring a floor of stability in the relationship with China. We will make no apology in pushing back on unfair trade practices that harm American workers. And we will guard against China taking advantage of America’s openness to use U.S. technologies against America, our allies, and our interests. Against this backdrop, we seek to “de-risk” and diversify the economic relationship between our countries, not decouple. We will protect a targeted number of sensitive technologies with focused restrictions, creating a “small yard and a high fence” that preserves our national security. President Biden has taken decisive action to counter unfair economic practices by the PRC and level the playing field for American workers, strategically increasing tariffs on a variety of products such as steel and aluminum, semiconductors, electric vehicles, batteries, critical minerals, solar cells, ship-to-shore cranes, and medical products. President Biden also knows that for America to succeed in future competition with China, we must continue to invest in our workers and industrial base now. That is why he issued an executive order on outbound investment, preserving and protecting American and allied national security interests by denying China access to most advanced technologies that allow them to develop their military and surveillance capacities. He also tightened restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence chips and manufacturing equipment, as well as semiconductor, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing technologies to China, stifling their military use of these technologies. And in areas where it is in the interests of the United States and the world for our two nations to work together – like addressing climate change and countering fentanyl trafficking – the United States will do so. President Biden pushed China to take action to curb the flow of fentanyl into the Americas, as well as to commit to climate change mitigation efforts as part of a global coalition. For all of this tough talk on China, Trump failed to deliver results for the American people. His reckless proposal to raise tariffs by 10 percent – not just on goods from China, but across the board on any imported goods from any country in the world – will cost American families an estimated $1,500 a year. His threat of a 60 percent tariff on Chinese goods will add another $1,000 annually. Trump’s temper tantrums have harmed our alliances, and if he is elected, will hurt the American people. Trump talks. President Biden delivers. In his second term, President Biden will remain focused on actions at home and abroad to outcompete China. He will continue to stand up to unfair economic practices, restrict the PRC’s access to advanced technologies that could be used to harm American interests, and reshore supply chains for materials and technologies critical for the 21st century. The Administration will continue to invest in our alliances and partnerships to ensure China cannot coerce its neighbors or overturn the international rules that keep America secure and prosperous. President Biden will also remain steadfast in America’s commitment to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait consistent with the U.S. One China policy – guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances – in order to continue to ensure that there are no unilateral changes to the status quo from either side. Even as we compete with China, the Administration will continue to responsibly manage the relationship with the PRC to avoid a costly spiral to conflict and seek to identify new areas where the United States and China may be able to work together, such as setting guardrails on the safe usage of artificial intelligence. THE MIDDLE EAST & NORTH AFRICA President Biden is working to build a durable peace in the Middle East bolstered by regional integration, a strong coalition to counter and deter Iran and prevent it and its terrorist proxies from threatening the security of the region, and a negotiated two-state solution that ensures Israel’s future as a Jewish and democratic state with recognized borders and upholds the right of Palestinians to live in freedom and security in a viable state of their own. The terrorist group Hamas sought to destroy the promise of that vision on October 7, 2023, but they will not succeed. The United States strongly supports Israel in the fight against Hamas. And the hard work of diplomacy under the President's leadership has made real progress on a way forward that will free the hostages, establish a durable ceasefire, ease humanitarian suffering in Gaza, and make possible normalization between Israel and key Arab states, together with meaningful progress and a political horizon for the Palestinian people. President Biden has spent decades working to advance U.S. interests and values in the Middle East. As President, he has met with and worked alongside every key leader in the region to de-escalate conflicts, deter aggression and forge new ways to promote stability, prosperity, human security, and peace. President Biden has long believed that partners and allies should be able to deter conflict and defend themselves in ways that safeguard human rights and prevent civilian harm. The Administration has worked tirelessly to deepen and widen regional integration. In September 2023, President Biden announced a new economic corridor to connect India to Europe through the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Israel. He also directed his Administration to build on the Abraham Accords and work on a historic normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia, As a tangible sign of this normalization process, President Biden helped negotiate the first-ever civilian aviation agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia, allowing for overflight of Israeli civilian aircraft in Saudi airspace and leading to a more integrated and economically connected Middle East. Through aggressive diplomacy backed by U.S. military power, the Administration has worked alongside our allies and partners to deter and defend against Iran and its terrorist surrogates. President Biden has postured U.S. military forces in the region and authorized precision airstrikes on key Iranian-linked targets tied to attacks against U.S. troops to deter further aggression by Iran. President Biden has also continued to protect the American people from terrorism, authorizing military strikes that took out ISIS emirs and the leader of Al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri. In response to brazen attacks by Iranian-linked Houthi forces against international commercial shipping, U.S. naval vessels in the Red Sea, and Israel, President Biden ordered military strikes, alongside key allies, against Houthi targets and organized Operation Prosperity Guardian, a coalition of more than 20 nations committed to defending international shipping and deterring Houthi attacks. When Iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones against Israel in April 2024, President Biden led an unprecedented defensive coalition – together with partners from Europe and across the Middle East – to defeat the attack, protect Israel, and stop the spread of a wider war. Through direct defensive action by the U.S. military and its partners, Iranian munitions did not cause significant damage, demonstrating both America’s ironclad commitment to the security of Israel and our unrivaled ability to leverage growing regional integration among U.S. partners to counter Iranian aggression. All of this stands in sharp contrast to Trump's fecklessness and weakness in the face of Iranian aggression during his presidency. In 2018, when Iranian-backed militias repeatedly attacked the U.S. consulate in Basra, Iraq Trump’s only response was to close our diplomatic facility. In June 2019, when Iran shot down a U.S. surveillance aircraft operating in international airspace above the Straits of Hormuz, Trump responded by tweet and then abruptly called off any actual retaliation, causing confusion and concern among his own national security team. In September 2019, when Iranian-backed groups threatened global energy markets by attacking Saudi oil infrastructure, Trump failed to respond against Iran or its proxies. In January 2020, when Iran, for the first and only time in its history, directly launched ballistic missiles against U.S. troops in western Iraq, Trump mocked the resulting Traumatic Brain Injuries suffered by dozens of American servicemembers as mere “headaches” – and again, took no action. The Administration continues to manage the fallout from Trump’s reckless and short-sighted decision to pull the United States out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action to constrain Iran’s nuclear weapons ambitions. Iran was abiding by the agreement not to expand its nuclear capacity until Trump’s costly mistake. Since then, as a result, Iran has gone from being more than a year away from being able to produce enough weapons grade material for a bomb to a matter of weeks, should it choose to do so. Iran has continued to advance its nuclear program, increase the size and enrichment level of its uranium stockpile, and develop, manufacture, and operate advanced centrifuges. President Biden remains committed to a diplomatic solution while standing resolute that Iran will never be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. Response to the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel and Next Steps to a Lasting Peace for Israelis and Palestinians President Biden and Vice President Harris believe a strong, secure, and democratic Israel is vital to the interests of the United States. Their commitment to Israel’s security, its qualitative military edge, its right to defend itself, and the 2016 Memorandum of Understanding is ironclad. President Biden and Vice President Harris recognize the worth of every innocent life, whether Israeli or Palestinian. President Biden and Vice President Harris have unequivocally denounced Hamas’s brutal attack on Israel on October 7, condemned the gruesome violence – including conflict-related sexual violence – demonstrated by Hamas and made clear that the United States wants to see Hamas defeated. President Biden traveled to Israel – the first U.S. president to do so at a time of war – in the days after October 7 to demonstrate that the United States stands with Israel in its quest for peace and security. He has also defended Israel at the U.N. against one-sided efforts to condemn Israel. The Administration worked with Congressional leaders to pass a historic aid package worth $14 billion to help Israel defend itself and to provide more than $1 billion for additional humanitarian aid to Gaza. President Biden has also been determined to broker an immediate and lasting ceasefire deal that once finalized secures the return of all hostages, including the remaining Americans held in Gaza; addresses the immense civilian pain and extreme suffering being caused by the conflict, including the displacement and death of so many innocent people in Gaza; results in a durable end to the war in Gaza; and sets the stage for a lasting regional peace. The President has made clear to the world the importance of this ceasefire and he and his team are working at the highest levels to finalize this deal. President Biden has also worked tirelessly – including through the appointment of a senior civilian coordinator for humanitarian relief – to surge and ensure the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people. Many vulnerable civilians are suffering deadly consequences of the Israel-Hamas war. Residents of Gaza have been displaced, and food insecurity has been severe. The Administration has worked relentlessly to deliver food, medicine, and other aid to the people of Gaza and to set the conditions for the reconstruction of communities in Gaza that have been devastated by the war. As President Biden has made clear, a ceasefire deal will lead to a more secure Israel and unlock the possibility of greater regional integration and historic normalization with its Arab neighbors. It will allow Israelis to safely return to their homes without fear of being attacked. A deal will also allow for Arab nations and the international community to help rebuild Gaza in a manner that does not allow Hamas to re-arm. It will allow the United States to work with partners to rebuild homes, schools, and hospitals in Gaza and repair destroyed communities. It would create the conditions for a better future for the Palestinian people, one of self-determination, dignity, security, and freedom, and ultimately a state of their own – a contrast to Trump, who refuses to endorse the political aspirations of the Palestinian people. President Biden and Vice President Harris oppose any unilateral steps by either side, including annexation, that undermine prospects for two states. We will continue to stand against incitement and terror. The Administration opposes settlement expansion. President Biden has spoken out against extremist settler violence, and in February, the President issued an executive order establishing U.S. authority to impose financial sanctions against foreign persons engaged in actions that threaten the peace, security, or stability of the West Bank. The Administration believes that while Jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations, it should remain the capital of Israel, an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths. We support critical assistance to the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza, consistent with U.S. law. The Administration opposes any effort to unfairly single out and delegitimize Israel, including at the United Nations or through the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement, while protecting the Constitutional right of our citizens to free speech. The Lebanese people deserve to live in an independent and sovereign Lebanon that is free from the grip of Iran-backed Hezbollah, and a corruption-free, competent, reform-minded government focused on addressing the needs of its people. In this regard, the Administration is also committed to facilitating a diplomatic resolution to the ongoing hostilities along the Israel-Lebanon border that would ensure the return of both Israeli and Lebanese families to their homes. WESTERN HEMISPHERE No region impacts the United States more directly than the Western Hemisphere. With $1.9 trillion in annual trade, shared values and democratic traditions and family bonds, our partners in Latin America and the Caribbean are key contributors to U.S. prosperity and resiliency. The President is building coalitions across the region that make America safer and more prosperous. He knows that we must work in lockstep with our neighbors to ensure democracies deliver on the issues that matter most to all of us. In the last four years, President Biden has strengthened ties with key allies across the Hemisphere. He designated Colombia as a major non-NATO ally, a recognition of the close and unique relationship between the countries that will strengthen our military and economic ties. Understanding that irregular migration affects every country in the hemisphere, President Biden led the development of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, a landmark agreement that strengthens cooperation on migration among 22 countries and promotes responsibility-sharing and a more orderly and humane management of migration across the region. He and the Vice President have created over 250,000 new jobs in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala under the Administration’s ambitious Root Causes strategy for Central America. President Biden also hosted the inaugural Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity Leaders’ Summit to establish an enduring forum to mobilize economic investment for the region. And he has strengthened bonds with our closest neighbors, Canada and Mexico, on issues ranging from border security to trade. President Biden is committed to countering corruption, authoritarianism, democratic backsliding, and violence in the region. He has continued to lay the groundwork for progress on U.S.-Cuba relations in a manner that benefits Americans, resuming flights between the two nations, reuniting separated families, and restoring diplomatic engagement on discrete issues like migration. And his Administration has also played a critical role in supporting Haiti’s stabilization efforts, becoming the largest financial sponsor to the Kenyan Multinational Security Support mission that is countering gang violence in the country and providing humanitarian aid. President Biden is also supporting human rights and fundamental freedoms as people across the region pursue a more just and prosperous future. Under President Biden, the United States negotiated the release of ten American hostages from Venezuela, reinstated sanctions on Venezuela’s oil and gas sector in response to President Nicolás Maduro failing to commit to free and fair elections, and cracked down on Nicaragua for repression of their population and abuse of migrants. In sharp contrast, the chaos of Trump’s presidency threw our critical partnerships in the region into turmoil. He normalized autocratic leadership and failed to stand up for shared American values. In his second term, President Biden will continue the work to ensure a secure border, protect U.S. jobs, and maintain stability in neighboring countries in order to keep Americans safe and prosperous. AFRICA By the end of the century, an estimated 40 percent of the world’s population will live in Africa. President Biden has strengthened partnerships in the region and recognizes African nations’ critical role in global stability and economic development. In a historic move, the Administration successfully advocated for the African Union to become a permanent member of the G20, ensuring Africa's voice in global economic discussions. And President Biden's hosting of Kenyan President Ruto for a state visit, the first by an African Head of State since 2008, underscored the importance of the U.S.-Kenya partnership, reflecting a broader strategy of strengthening bilateral ties across the continent grounded in mutual respect. The Administration’s work with the continent is focused on advancing democratic governance, fostering sustainable economic growth, improving health outcomes, and addressing the urgent challenges of climate change. The U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in 2022 underscored how the United States and African nations are expanding partnerships to meet shared challenges. The President is committed to continuing work that will support American and African institutions and citizens as they respond to emerging opportunities and challenges in an increasingly urban and connected world. His pledge to invest $55 billion over three years across Africa is a reflection of that commitment. Through initiatives like the African Growth and Opportunity Act and Prosper Africa, the Administration is deepening economic ties between African countries and the United States, advancing regional integration, and helping realize Africa’s immense economic potential for our mutual benefit. President Biden is committed to addressing development challenges and urgent humanitarian needs across the continent. The Administration has invested and committed to provide nearly $20 billion in health programs across Africa. It has delivered over $13 billion in emergency aid and food security assistance for resilient African food systems and supply markets. President Biden has also launched a new strategic partnership on food security between the United States and the African Union that will leverage the public and private sectors, along with multilateral development banks and international financial institutions to accelerate transformational investments in sustainable and resilient food systems to prevent food shocks before they happen. Strengthening the capacity of African nations to address security threats, including terrorism and violent extremism, remains a top priority. The Administration is expanding support for African-led peacekeeping operations and conflict resolution initiatives, ensuring that interventions align with the aspirations of local communities. President Biden also places significant emphasis on human rights and the rule of law, leveraging diplomatic channels and development assistance to promote these values. He will continue to push for a return to democracy in cooperation with the African Union in areas experiencing violence and instability, including Sudan, where he named a Special Envoy to work towards ending the conflict. Trump routinely ignored and disrespected the African continent, denigrating some nations as “shithole countries.” By giving up America’s moral authority in the region, he damaged America’s ability to collaboratively shape Africa and the world’s future. In his second term, President Biden will continue to build 21st century U.S.-African partnerships. He will also work to ensure that Africa has a seat at the table in major global decisions by lobbying for United States Security Council reform that will secure permanent representation for Africa. STRENGTHENING THE U.S. AND GLOBAL ECONOMY President Biden’s international economic policies promote growth, resilient supply chains, and clean energy adoption, while empowering American workers and workers everywhere. For too long, America’s trade policies and approach to the global economy let middle-class jobs move offshore, hollowed out our supply chains, rewarded corporate CEOs instead of valuing workers, and failed to generate inclusive economic growth. In response to the previous status quo, President Biden is committed to building a fairer, more durable global economic order, for the benefit of the American people and for people everywhere. Under President Biden, the United States is championing a modern industrial and innovation strategy, both domestically and with international partners. That strategy is focused on bolstering our economic and technological strengths, promoting diverse and resilient global supply chains, and setting high standards for labor, environmental practices, trusted technology, and good governance. It also aims to channel capital towards delivering public goods such as climate solutions and healthcare advancements. America’s prosperity and the prosperity of our allies and partners are mutually reinforcing. Under President Biden’s leadership, companies from American allies are building cutting-edge factories in the United States, employing hundreds of thousands of Americans. U.S. partners provide critical materials, expertise, and products the world needs to achieve global climate goals, and are important markets for U.S. goods. Trade with allies and partners on fair terms promotes growth and reinforces alliances. With the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, and bilateral initiatives such as the U.S.-Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership, the United States will mobilize tens of billions of dollars to invest in clean energy development and critical infrastructure with high labor standards around the world. These investments will result in high-quality growth, increased supply chain resilience, and progress toward global climate goals. American strength at home and leadership in the world depends on America remaining at the forefront of technological innovation. President Biden will work with governments, experts, and members of the private sector to ensure that artificial intelligence and other innovative technologies lead to progress without creating new national security risks and societal divisions. Building on joint technology initiatives with the European Union, India, Singapore, South Korea, and other partners, President Biden will promote innovation and shared rules for global technologies. Trump was the first President of the United States to leave office having fewer jobs in his Administration than when he became President. Unlike Biden, whose targeted tariffs on China will promote U.S. growth, Trump’s plan to increase taxes on imports from allies, like European cancer drugs and foods from Mexico and Latin America, will fall hard on American families. Trump has consistently failed to help American workers because he has always put himself first. President Biden has and always will put American workers first. In his second term, President Biden will continue to invest in America and our allies and partners to grow the middle class globally. He will pursue modern industrial policies, make strategic public investments to fill in where markets cannot, work to secure our supply chains on critical technologies, and fight for a global minimum tax that ensures corporations pay their fair share. President Biden will also continue to work with our allies and partners to protect labor and climate standards while helping America compete and win on the world stage. He will leverage economic tools and diplomatic partnerships and he will rally the world against economic coercion, utilizing mechanisms like the G7, World Bank, and other multilateral institutions. LEADING WITH DIPLOMACY AND AMERICAN VALUES President Biden has often said that the United States is strongest when we lead not only with the example of our power but with the power of our example. Military force should be a tool of last resort, not the first. Commitment to our values at home and abroad requires working alongside our allies and using every diplomatic tool available to advance American interests. It means investing in members of our Civil and Foreign Service, who lead America’s engagement with the world and work in support of our shared prosperity and security in rapidly changing and increasingly complex environments. President Biden ended America’s longest war, bringing our troops home from Afghanistan and facilitating the resettlement of over 120,000 Afghan partners and their families in the United States, the largest resettlement effort since the Vietnam War. And in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States rallied the world to address a global food crisis and provided $2 billion in global humanitarian assistance. President Biden's leadership globally was clear in his response to the COVID-19 pandemic among other global health challenges. Between May 2021 and February 2024 the United States donated more than 693 million vaccine doses to 117 countries and economies. And the Administration led the largest-ever replenishment of the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria, with donors pledging $15.7 billion. Understanding that there is nothing more important than addressing the climate crisis, President Biden has kept his word and ensured that the United States leads the world to combat climate change. The record-breaking heat, floods, storms, drought, and wildfires devastating communities around the world underscore the grave risks we already face and the urgency needed to reduce emissions and to help the most vulnerable countries cope with devastating climate impacts. The United States rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement on day one of his presidency, and President Biden set an ambitious goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, in line with climate science. And the Administration is supporting investments in climate infrastructure that make tangible progress on climate mitigation and adaptation while also helping developing countries unlock economic growth in key areas. In response to the rise of authoritarianism across the globe, President Biden convened two Summits for Democracy, bringing allies and partners together to strengthen democratic resilience, combat corruption, and promote human rights globally, including for LGBTQI+ persons. The third Summit occurred this year under South Korea’s leadership, and President Biden is proud to have catalyzed this new global forum to support and coordinate democracies around the world, and which will continue in his second term. President Biden believes the United States must continue to be a strong advocate for the rights and opportunities of women and girls around the world. Under his leadership, the United States issued its first-ever National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality, which recognizes that elevating the status of women and girls is not just the right thing to do – it is a strategic imperative that advances American interests in prosperity and stability. When women and girls are healthy, educated, and able to participate economically, their families and communities prosper, poverty decreases, and economies grow. And when women participate in conflict resolution and post-conflict processes, it improves the likelihood of securing sustainable peace. President Biden will continue to support the United States Strategy and National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security and will continue to work to end the epidemic of gender-based violence around the world, including efforts to increase accountability for conflict-related sexual violence. His Administration will continue prioritizing ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. President Biden understands that advancing the rights of women and girls includes sexual and reproductive health and rights. His Administration has prioritized women’s health by rescinding the global gag rule (Mexico City Policy), and supporting funding for the UN Population Fund. Trump's undermining of democratic institutions, attacks on the free press, and refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election weakened the global perception of American democracy, giving autocracies a pretext to dismiss democratic values and practices. These actions collectively eroded the United States' standing on the world stage. President Biden will never turn our back on our alliances or fail to stand up for human rights and democracy around the world and at home. In his second term, he will support the critical work of our diplomats and continue to fight to bring Americans detained abroad home. President Biden will continue work to strengthen global health systems, bolster pandemic preparedness programs, and alleviate global food insecurity. He will expand on America’s track record of providing humanitarian assistance to those most in need including by resettling 100,000 refugees in 2024, the most in three decades after Trump nearly destroyed the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. President Biden will also ensure the United States continues to drive multilateral efforts to reduce poverty, address unsustainable debt burdens and build a more inclusive and more fair global economy. He will continue to lead on efforts to combat the existential threat of climate change and support adaptation efforts in developing nations. And he will keep fighting corruption, supporting good governance, and countering terrorist threats around the world. STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE WORLD The United States has the finest fighting force in the history of the world. And while our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, Coast Guardsmen and guardians remain the envy of the globe, President Biden understands that maintaining our military advantages in the future means making strategic investments now. That is why the Administration has invested in cutting-edge capabilities across all services and domains and maintained a commitment to modernize and recapitalize the nuclear triad as the bedrock of deterrence. That is also why President Biden has made historic investments in America’s military industrial base, putting billions of dollars to work in America to increase production capacity of critical munitions and other capabilities to support U.S. and allied forces in combat zones such as Ukraine. And as the Administration does the work to plan against dramatic changes in geopolitics, technology, economics, and the environment, our military has maintained its ability to address terrorist threats, evidenced by successful strikes against leaders of al-Qa’ida and ISIS. Properly investing in our military also means first and foremost investing in those who are the bedrock of it: our service members. President Biden has secured pay raises for military personnel in recognition of their invaluable service. His Administration has allocated over $10 billion to enhance health care services for veterans and active-duty personnel, including expanded mental health resources and programs to support those suffering from PTSD and other service-related conditions. President Biden’s consistent efforts to address military housing issues resulted in a $1.4 billion investment in military housing improvements, leading to better living conditions and increased oversight of housing contracts. The Administration's policies have also supported military spouses, with over $200 million in funds dedicated to bolstering education and employment opportunities, underscoring the critical role that families play in the strength and resilience of the armed forces. Aware of exacerbated nuclear proliferation challenges that the world is facing as Russia, the PRC and North Korea expand and diversify their nuclear arsenals, and in the context of Iran continuing to enrich uranium at dangerous levels, the Administration is showing what it means to act responsibly as a nuclear power. Nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. The United States is developing and fielding only what is required to deter while signaling openness to future arms control negotiations if competitors are interested. The Administration is modernizing each leg of our nuclear triad, updating our command, control, and communication systems, and investing in our nuclear enterprise – to ensure that we can sustain and enhance if necessary capabilities and posture. President Biden has reaffirmed in U.S. doctrine that U.S. nuclear weapons are reserved for deterring strategic attack by those that threaten us and our allies and partners with nuclear weapons. Trump has never understood the values that our military swears to uphold. Instead, he calls our service members “suckers” and “losers.” He can never make America great, because he does not understand the values represented by our military that already make us great. President Biden has never and will never turn his back on our military. In his second term, he will continue to invest in upgrading to next-generation weapon systems, cutting-edge training opportunities, and deterrence capabilities such as our submarine force and the nuclear triad. He will continue to address cyber threats by bolstering the capacity of our intelligence communities and leading the development of rules of the road for technologies like artificial intelligence. And he will continue to always put our veterans and military families first by securing additional pay raises for service members, accessible and affordable childcare for our military families, good-paying job opportunities for military spouses, effective suicide and sexual assault prevention programs, and benefits for our veterans and their families.",279066,42878,"’ democratic party platform democratic national convention land acknowledgement the democratic national committee wishes to acknowledge that we gather together to state our values on lands that have been stewarded through many centuries by the ancestors and descendants of tribal nations who have been here since time immemorial. we honor the communities native to this continent, and recognize that our country was built on indigenous homelands. we pay our respects to the millions of indigenous people throughout history who have protected our lands, waters, and animals. while we meet in chicago, we also recognize and honor the traditional homelands of the anishinaabe, also known as the council of the three fires: the ojibwe, odawa, and potawatomi nations. we acknowledge the many other tribes who consider this area their traditional homeland, including the myaamia, ho-chunk, menominee, sac and fox, peoria, kaskaskia, wea, kickapoo, and mascouten. democrats continue to support tribes as they advocate for the united states to uphold treaty and trust responsibilities. we applaud that in , under the biden-harris administration, the prairie band of potawatomi nation became the first federally recognized tribal nation in illinois in years, when the u.s. department of the interior placed acres of the shab-eh-nay reservation in nearby dekalb county into trust. preamble our nation is at an inflection point. what kind of america will we be? a land of more freedom, or less freedom? more rights or fewer? an economy rigged for the rich and powerful, or where everyone has a fair shot at getting ahead? will we lower the temperature in our politics and come together, or treat each other as enemies instead? the stakes in this election are enormously high. president biden and vice president harris took office during a time of global pandemic, record job loss, and record crime. these past fo ur years, democrats proved once again that democracy can deliver, and made tremendous progress turning the country around. president biden and vice president harris turned a setback into a great american comeback for working families. we’ve created nearly million jobs, a record number of small businesses are being started, and factories are coming home. we lowered families' health insurance premiums, and we stood up to big pharma to lower prescription drug prices. we’re helping students catch up on learning loss, and we’re forgiving millions of crushing student loans. we passed the first significant gun safety law in decades and made record investments in public safety, putting more police officers on the beat; today, violent crime is at its lowest in years. we’re fighting climate change, reducing pollution, and fueling a clean energy boom. we’re rebuilding our nation’s roads, bridges, highways, ports, airports, water systems, and more. we’re seizing record amounts of fentanyl and securing our border in the face of republican inaction. we’re closing the racial wealth gap and the gender pay gap. we’ve expanded benefits and services for toxic-exposed veterans; and we’re strengthening nato and restoring american leadership in the world. there is so much more to do. democrats will fix the tax system so everyone has a fair shot. we will restore the right to choose. we will continue to bring down costs for families. we will continue to reject political violence of all forms and give hate no safe harbor. donald trump has a very different vision – one focused not on opportunity and optimism, but on revenge and retribution; not on the american people, but on himself. he and his extreme maga allies are ripping away our bedrock personal freedoms, dictating what health care decisions women can make, banning books, and telling people who they can love. they’re rigging our economy for their rich friends and big corporations, pushing more trickle-down tax cuts for the wealthy and powerful, and a new national sales tax that will cost every working family an average $, a year. they’ll cut the social security benefits that folks have paid into for their whole lives; and gut medicare, medicaid, health care, and prescription drug coverage. they are eroding our democracy with lies and threats, have refused to denounce political violence, and are making it harder to vote. and given the chance, they’ll keep stacking our courts, locking in their extreme agenda for decades. we cannot let that happen. president biden, vice president harris, and democrats are running to finish the job. to grow our economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down. to reward work, not wealth. to lower costs. to tackle the climate crisis, lower energy costs, and secure energy independence. to protect communities and tackle the scourge of gun violence. to secure the border and fix the broken immigration system. to advance the president’s unity agenda. to strengthen american leadership worldwide. history has shown that nothing about democracy is guaranteed. every generation has to protect it, preserve it, choose it. we must stand together to choose what we want america to be. table of contents chapter one: growing our economy

strongest military in the world chapter one: growing our economy from the bottom up & middle out this election is a choice between two very different economic visions for america: donald trump, who sees the world from his country club at mar-a-lago; and joe biden, who sees it from kitchen tables in scranton like the one he grew up around. his economic agenda is about main street, not wall street. it’s about ending the days of trickle-down economics and investing in america – in all americans – and delivering for communities too long left behind. while democrats keep fighting to lower costs for working families, trump is rigging our economy for his mar-a-lago friends and billionaire donors, who like him, are only in it for themselves. as president, trump doubled down on the trickle-down policies of the past, cutting investment in infrastructure and education, and rewarding big corporations that ship jobs and profits overseas. he vowed to bring new factories to communities across america, but left nothing behind but a string of broken promises. democrats have a different record. we’re delivering on president biden’s pledge to rebuild our economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down. we’re investing in america – in our infrastructure, our industry, our people, and our future. while trump left office with historic budget deficits and the worst jobs record since herbert hoover, since president biden took office, this country has come back from the brink, the deficit has fallen by over $ trillion, and we have the best jobs record since john f. kennedy. we’re powering the strongest economic recovery in the world. economic progress at the start of the biden-harris administration, in the midst of the worst economic crisis in years, experts feared a stagnating recovery and even worried about a new recession. but democrats chose to put workers first, and instead of recession, america has seen remarkable strength and resilience. our economy grew by . percent last year – the fastest rate of any major economy in the world. we’ve added nearly million jobs – not only recovering all the positions lost during trump’s botched handling of covid, but also adding . million more than existed before the pandemic – surpassing pre-pandemic projections for the labor market. during this administration, states from mississippi to pennsylvania have seen record-low unemployment; and the run of low unemployment nationwide hasn’t been this long in over years. wages are up across the board, and rising fastest for lower-income workers, black workers, latinos, and women. today’s recovery is the fairest on record; in just four years, we’ve erased percent of the wage inequality gap that took four decades to build. a record million small business applications have been filed since president biden took office, each one of them an act of hope. while too many families still feel the pain of inflation at the grocery store, or around the kitchen table when they sit down to pay their bills, we’re making progress. wages are rising faster than prices, and inflation today is down nearly two-thirds from its peak. we have to finish the job. democrats will keep fighting to prevent the kind of supply chain shocks and corporate greed that have done so much to raise prices. and we'll keep investing in american workers, american jobs, and american families, bringing factories home to win the race for the future. democrats know the story of the middle class isn’t separate from the state of the economy – it’s at its heart. and we’ll never quit fighting to make sure that everyone is in on the deal. investing in america infrastructure we can’t have the best economy in the world if we don’t have the best infrastructure. and for generations, american infrastructure was the envy of the world. but over the years, we stopped investing in it, and we fell to thirteenth in infrastructure rankings. the trump administration declared it “infrastructure week” every week for four years, and never built a thing. but under president biden, we’re finally rebuilding our roads, bridges, ports, airports, water systems, electric grids, broadband, and more, paving the way for a great american “infrastructure decade” that will create hundreds of thousands of good-paying union jobs. the bipartisan infrastructure law is breaking ground on over , projects across , communities nationwide. we’re rebuilding major roadways, from the blatnik bridge, a vital link between wisconsin and minnesota that carries more $ billion in goods a year through the largest great lakes port; to a key stretch of the i- outside phoenix that sees , vehicles a day. we’re making the biggest investment in public transit in history, and at last building america’s first true high-speed rail lines. we’re replacing every toxic lead pipe in the country within a decade, so every child can turn on the faucet at home or at school and drink clean water without risking cancer or brain damage. we’ve added over , megawatts of new clean power capacity, the equivalent of building hoover dams, to help shrink energy costs and meet ambitious climate goals. and we’re bringing affordable, reliable, high-speed internet to every american household. high-speed internet is as vital to our economy today as electricity first was a century ago; americans need it to do their jobs, to do their homework, to access health care, and to stay connected. but a full million of us still live in areas where there is no high-speed internet. democrats are closing that divide. these projects don’t just build infrastructure, they create hundreds of thousands of good jobs for american workers. manufacturing democrats are also taking historic steps to bring home critical supply chains, and to reaffirm our nation’s leadership in cutting-edge industries that america in fact often pioneered. after the pandemic exposed our reliance on foreign-made semiconductors, we passed the chips and science act, to restore america’s role producing the tiny computer chips needed to make everything from cell phones to dishwashers to cars. and as the climate crisis makes the shift to clean energy more urgent, we passed the inflation reduction act, making the world’s biggest investment ever in building renewable energy, electric vehicles, and other green technologies here at home. the president's investing in america agenda has incentivized a historic $ billion in private funding across the united states to date. companies are investing hundreds of billions more than under trump to build new factories. in fact, under president biden, more than a dozen states have seen the largest private sector investments in their history. we’ve designated more than tech hubs in communities from reno, nevada; to charlotte, north carolina; to north central pennsylvania. and we’ve made sure that lower-income counties see a larger share of investment. today, instead of exporting american jobs for cheaper labor, we’re creating american jobs and exporting products, leaving no one behind. under president biden, we’ve also boosted funding for the kind of research and development that can seed economy-transforming breakthroughs, like the internet. in recent years, america became one of the world’s only major countries to pull back on r&d investments; democrats are changing that. president biden for example launched the advanced research projects agency for health (arpa-h) in , to find game-changing medical cures and treatments and transform important areas of medicine. under his leadership, we’ll continue supporting nasa and america’s presence on the international space station, and working to send americans back to the moon and to mars. democrats will keep america at the forefront of scientific discovery and innovation, responsibly leading the way in the defining fields of the future, like ai, biotech, quantum computing, advanced materials, and more. good jobs these generational investments are transforming our economy, creating new businesses, new jobs, and new cycles of hope – in red states and blue states; in rural, urban, and tribal nation communities too long left behind. in all, president biden’s agenda has already created nearly , manufacturing jobs, and , more jobs in construction, building the roads, factories, and dreams of our future. more americans are employed in these fields and clean energy today than ever were under trump. president biden’s agenda requires that any federally-financed infrastructure job must include wage and labor protections. and we’re making sure that these projects use american-made goods, by strengthening “buy american” procurement rules to their toughest level in seven decades. that means every federally funded infrastructure project is being built with american-made steel, lumber, drywall, concrete, and other products, by american workers. and the administration has taken historic steps to ensure that these workers are paid prevailing wages, with the free and fair choice to join a union; and to incentivize project labor agreements. president biden believes that you shouldn't have to go to a four-year college to live a good, middle-class life. democrats are working to make sure that every american can access these quality new jobs, where many people can earn over $, a year. the american rescue plan supported more than , state- and local-government workforce development programs; while our investing in american agenda is expanding job-training partnerships between high schools, community colleges, unions, and employers. we have a million trainees enrolled in registered apprenticeships today. apprenticeships have long provided a reliable path to the middle class, empowering workers to earn while they learn, not only in traditional trades, but also in new cutting-edge industries. extreme republicans have proposed gutting funding for registered apprenticeships in this year's budget. we’ll keep making historic investments in them to keep expanding opportunity , including by partnering directly with unions. democrats know that wall street didn’t build america. the middle class built america – and unions built the middle class. president biden and vice president harris are proud to lead the most pro-union administration in history. president biden named staunch labor allies and former union leaders to positions across the government, and empowered them to fight for good jobs and workers’ rights. biden is the first president to walk a picket line, joining uaw workers on strike in detroit before they won historic wage increases last year. he knows that when unions win, all workers benefit; and as we rebuild our economy for the future, every worker needs a voice and a fair shot. democrats will keep fighting to pass the protecting the right to organize (pro) act, to give everyone the right to organize for better pay, benefits, and working conditions, and to hold abusive bosses accountable for violating workers’ rights. we oppose state right-to-work laws, which drive down wages and leave workers unsafe; and we support penalizing employers who engage in union busting. we’ll work to pass the public service freedom to negotiate act, guaranteeing public sector bargaining rights; and to codify a right to organize for domestic workers, farm workers, and other unprotected laborers. democrats will continue to create strong labor standards for jobs created with taxpayer dollars through legislation and with strong buy american rules. consistent with the law, we will ensure that federal grants and other assistance to employers are contingent on recipients committing to not interfering with workers’ efforts to form a union. by leveraging the benefits of federal grants for infrastructure, manufacturing and services, we will seek to ensure that all americans have the opportunity to participate in the american dream. we’ll strengthen enforcement and penalties for safety, wage, and other labor and employment violations. and, democrats will continue to aggressively hold companies accountable for violating child labor law. we’ve increased funding for the occupational safety and health administration to protect workers on the job; and we’ll continue to support workplace whistleblowers. at the same time, we’re pushing to guarantee workers the pay, benefits, and protections they deserve as well. we passed the butch lewis act, keeping over million people’s hard-earned pensions solvent. we also raised the minimum wage for federal contractors to $. an hour, and will keep pushing congress to increase it to at least $ for all americans. we’re making millions more hourly workers eligible for overtime pay; and we’ve cracked down on wage theft and exploitation, recovering over $ million for low-wage workers wrongly denied pay. we’re making it harder for employers to misclassify workers as independent contractors to avoid paying them full pay and benefits. we’re banning most non-compete agreements, freeing workers to move between jobs and negotiate. and we’ve restricted mandatory arbitration, so fewer employers can silence wronged employees in a workplace dispute. we also recognize that the u.s. postal service is the world’s most efficient, and democrats are wholly committed to supporting a public u.s.p.s. we will fight all efforts to privatize it and will work to ensure that it’s financially sustainable. we will protect its universal service obligation and on-time delivery. and we will support a board of governors and a postal regulatory commission that champion a strong public postal service. trump has a very different record. as president, he not only failed to bring manufacturing jobs home, he pushed to cut funding for r&d and job training. he gave tax breaks to big corporations, with no condition that they invest in workers or innovation in return. he stacked his labor department and national labor relations board with corporate lawyers who made it harder to organize, not easier. his administration ripped protections from federal workers, slashed workplace safety inspections, and blocked increases in overtime pay. now, trump and his allies are vowing to repeal key pieces of the biden agenda – stalling historic progress; undermining american manufacturing; and costing hundreds of thousands of americans the good paychecks and future prospects that they deserve. democrats won’t let that happen. we fought hard to pass the most significant investments in america in generations. now, we’ll continue the important work of implementing them, to be sure that the benefits are shared in every corner of america and create good-paying jobs that folks can raise a family on, with the chance to join a union, and that rely on materials made here at home. we cannot go backwards. we have to own these industries and jobs of the future. small businesses small businesses are the engine of america’s economy and the glue of our communities. they employ nearly half of all private sector workers, and drive half of all economic activity. they embody the vision and grit that literally built this country. when president biden took office, our economy was reeling and millions of small businesses were hanging by a thread. business owners faced the prospect of losing not just their livelihoods, but their dreams, their life’s savings, and their hopes of leaving something behind for their kids. so democrats moved fast. within weeks, we reformed the paycheck protection program, getting game-changing help to thousands of america’s smallest businesses, which had been shut out by trump. then, we passed the american rescue plan and helped million small businesses pay their bills and workers and stay afloat. and thanks to that legislation, we provided additional support to , restaurants and , child care centers serving millions of kids, which working parents rely on. not a single republican voted for it. since then, democrats have passed other historic laws, to build infrastructure, semiconductors, clean energy, and the small-business supply chains that support those cutting-edge industries, here at home. the administration is expanding access to capital, business opportunities, and training to help those small businesses; while working for a fairer tax code, to level the playing field for small entrepreneurs who have to compete against corporate giants. the administration has invested a record $ billion in community development finance institutions (cdfis), to support small businesses and growth across low-income communities. the small business administration is nearly halfway to its goal of providing $ billion in financing to , small businesses by . for example, to get mom-and-pop businesses the small loans, under $,, that are often hard to secure, the sba has brought in additional non-traditional lenders that specialize in working with underserved small businesses. it’s now on track to double these loans by year’s end, compared to . the administration is also directing billions of dollars to community lenders and state-level small-business programs. along with initiatives like vice president harris’s economic opportunity coalition, it is mobilizing hundreds of billions more in private investment. at the same time, the federal government this year set a record for small business contract spending, awarding them percent of total procurement dollars, directly supporting a million jobs. it is on track to meet its goal of increasing federal contracts awarded to small disadvantaged businesses by percent. as a result, america is today in the midst of a historic small-business boom. a record million new business applications have been filed since joe biden became president – the three strongest years of new business growth in history, and over percent faster than pre-pandemic averages. since the pandemic, the share of black households owning a business has more than doubled, latino business ownership is up percent, and women own a record share of businesses. as president biden often says, each new business formed is an act of hope. thanks to president biden’s bipartisan infrastructure law, the minority business development agency is now a permanent part of the commerce department, where it’s training underserved entrepreneurs. the sba’s innovative community navigators program meanwhile helped , small businesses tap into resources that have helped them grow. in a second biden term, we’ll make that navigator program permanent, and include new lenders, new markets, and fairer taxes. trump still puts wall street before main street. as president, he slashed the tax rate for giant corporations, but left small businesses behind. his disastrous response to covid funneled assistance to well-connected friends and companies, but left too many of our smallest businesses without essential help. more than , closed. he’s now running on a plan to double-down on his tax scam to benefit big corporations and billionaires. his congressional allies keep trying to slash sba funding, and to repeal our investments in infrastructure and manufacturing – the same ones that are lowering costs for small businesses, boosting their revenue, and helping millions to thrive. democrats won’t let that happen. agriculture american farmers are the backbone of our country. they feed america, and help feed the world. but over the years, trickle-down economics has hit rural america hard. farming costs have gone up and incomes have gone down. big agriculture moved in, telling too many small farms that the surest path to success was to get big or get out. as a result, we lost over , farms in america in the last years, and rural communities have paid a steep price. too many young people have had to leave their hometowns to find good-paying work and a shot at their dreams. the president believes that no one should have to leave the community where they grew up just to find opportunity. his investing in america agenda is investing in all of america, including farms and rural areas. it’s creating new sources of income for farmers and increasing competition among suppliers, to both lower the cost of farm inputs and to get small and mid-size farmers a larger share of profits. the inflation reduction act is helping farmers and ranchers adopt climate-smart practices, which make the land more resilient and increase profitability, while connecting them to new markets and premiums for sustainably produced commodities. the administration recognizes the critical role that our land stewards play in our food systems, economy, and environment, and is working hard to drive both public and private funds to reward these champions for nature for their hard work. the administration has also supported independent meat and poultry processing, reducing producers’ reliance on big companies to buy their product; and it’s working to make livestock and poultry markets fairer and more transparent. today, family farms have more income from more varied sources, so their children have more opportunity to stay family farmers. at the same time, the administration is helping family farmers service distressed loans in order to keep their lands and ultimately pass them down to their kids. it has worked with many farmers to boost the production of expensive fertilizer, increasing supply and easing costs for everyone else. the u.s.d.a. also expanded farm insurance to allow for more double cropping, a practice that increases farm earnings, expands the food supply, and helps lower average food prices for american families. going forward, democrats will also work to get farmers the right to repair their own equipment, without having to pay big equipment makers for diagnostic tools and repairs. and we will look to further limit foreign ownership of u.s. farmland to protect our food supply and national security. throughout, democrats have stood by farm workers. we are working to improve workers’ safety at meat processing facilities, and we will continue to enforce and advance labor and environmental rules, for example promoting organizing rights and requiring overtime pay, and boosting protections against harmful pesticides and extreme heat. fighting poverty as democrats, we believe in an america where people look out for one another and leave no one behind. but we know we still have a long way to go to make america’s promise real for everyone. some million americans still live in poverty. the pandemic made things worse, hitting the poor hardest, and pushing millions more families to the brink. the american rescue plan drove poverty to record lows in . it expanded the child tax credit and made it available to all low-income children for the first time, helping to slash child poverty by nearly half. it tripled the maximum earned income tax credit for millions of low-income workers, so their taxes wouldn’t push them deeper into poverty. it kept million families in their homes, child care centers open, and small businesses on their feet. it increased supplemental nutrition assistance program (snap) benefits, helping tens of millions of americans keep food on the table. not a single republican voted for the bill. and the administration has done more. it reversed a trump-era policy that would have risked putting half-a-million children in poverty. it modernized snap benefits for the first time since , permanently increasing them and lifting more than million people, including over a million children, out of poverty as well. president biden signed into law a permanent special summer nutrition program that will help million kids. and he successfully blocked congressional republican proposals that would’ve increased poverty by slashing health care, housing, food assistance, and more. now, it’s time to finish the job. democrats know that most folks fundamentally want the same things – not a hand out, but a fair shot. that’s why we’ll keep pushing to restore the expanded child tax credit and earned income tax credit, which proved so effective at reducing poverty before republicans let them expire. we’ll work to finally raise the federal minimum wage to at least $-an-hour. we’ll fight for paid leave, better health care, and more investment in public schools and affordable housing. we’ll reduce the need for foster care, by supporting families and engaging kin. we’ll further expand public transit, connecting communities that have been cut off for too long. we’ll keep working to get more low-income families access to affordable banking as well, and to boost the supply of capital and loans by investing more in cdfis. we’ll also push to make the new markets tax credit permanent, drawing new investment to low-income communities nationwide. and we’ll continue to reject republican proposals to increase poverty by making devastating cuts to programs that vulnerable americans count on. in the wealthiest nation on earth, we all benefit when we help one another. democrats will keep working to build an economy that rewards work, not wealth; where we care for the most vulnerable, and unleash the potential that all our children have to grow and thrive. we remain committed to fighting poverty and enabling all americans to live up to their god-given potential. ending special interest giveaways to invest in the american people and reduce the deficit, democrats are also ending giveaways to big corporations and special interests that have benefitted at the expense of american taxpayers for too long. we’re seizing a tremendous opportunity for savings on prescription drugs and insurance. the administration has already cracked down on one of big pharma’s biggest scams, by finally giving medicare, the single biggest buyer of drugs in america, the ability to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, as the va and private insurers have done for years. the administration is also requiring drugmakers to reimburse medicare if they hike prices faster than inflation. that kind of markup pads big pharma profits, wasting taxpayer dollars. democrats will expand the number of drugs subject to price caps and negotiation under the inflation reduction act, saving taxpayers nearly $ billion over the next years, as medicare will no longer have to pay big pharma exorbitant prices. at the same time, we’ll keep pushing to crack down on outsize insurance company profits, for example by requiring health insurers to reimburse medicaid if they bill more than they actually spend on patient care. we also believe in saving taxpayers money by investing more in preventative health care, vaccines, and other treatment for medicaid and chip beneficiaries, avoiding unnecessary medical costs by keeping folks healthy – investing in america, and in the american people. chapter two: rewarding work, not wealth to any american with the ingenuity and drive to make a million bucks, president biden says, great. just pay your fair share in taxes. a hedge fund manager or ceo should never pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or firefighter. a company with billions of dollars in profits should not pay $ in taxes. a fair tax code is how we invest in the things that make our nation strong, like health care, education, a clean environment, and the national defense. it’s how we protect programs that americans rely on, like social security and medicare. it’s how we build a powerful economy, reduce fiscal risks , and lead the world. donald trump is focused on rigging the game for his billionaire donors instead. he always puts himself and his rich friends first. in , he enacted a reckless, unpaid-for tax cut that overwhelmingly benefited the very wealthy and biggest corporations. it was full of outrageous giveaways, including a massive tax break for the wealthiest . percent. it slashed the corporate tax rate by nearly half, with executives plowing their windfalls into stock buybacks for their own benefit, rather than investing in workers or better products, or lowering prices. after weakening labor protections and complaining that wages are ""too high,” trump is now telling donors behind closed doors at mar-a-lago: “you’re rich as hell, and we’re going to give you tax cuts.” that trickle-down approach never worked. trump’s allies predicted that his tax scam would push economic growth as high as percent, but america’s growth rate barely changed. the law had no impact on the average american’s income – only boosting wages for those in the top percent. trump’s allies claimed it would pay for itself, but it instead exploded the federal deficit by $ trillion. trump’s policies added more to our national debt than has ever been added in a presidential term. corporate profits have doubled since the pandemic, yet trump wants to reward corporations with another big tax cut. republicans are doubling down on trump’s failed approach and have proposed $ trillion in new corporate tax cuts. they’ll repeal the estate tax, so the wealthiest . percent of americans can pass wealth on to their heirs tax-free. they’ll give american billionaires an average $. million tax break – a giveaway nearly times bigger than what the average family earns in a year. house republicans have vowed to pay for part of all that by cutting social security and medicare for everyone else. economists say trump’s billionaire giveaways and extreme tariffs will slow growth, cost jobs, and trigger a recession his first year back in office, raising taxes on middle-class families by $, a year, and adding trillions to the deficit. democrats have a different view. we don’t believe we should add $ trillion to the national debt to give more tax breaks skewed to the wealthy and big corporations. we’re fighting to reward work, not wealth – to cut costs and make the tax code fairer for the middle class, while making the wealthy and big corporations finally pay their fair share. under president biden’s plan, no american earning less than $, a year will pay one single penny more in federal taxes, period. we’re working to end special interest giveaways, and to make sure all americans play by the same rules. and instead of exploding the national deficit, our plan cuts it by $ trillion over the next decade, delivering real results for the american people in a fiscally responsible way. cutting taxes for working families democrats will protect everyone earning less than $, a year from any tax increase; and we will fight to protect and expand other tax benefits for working people and families with children. during the pandemic, democrats expanded the child tax credit, saving nearly million families with million children up to $, per child per year, and cutting child poverty nearly in half to its lowest rate on record. we expanded the earned income tax credit as well, saving over million low-paid workers an average $ a year. and, we expanded the health insurance premium tax credit, saving millions of families who buy coverage on an affordable care act exchange about $ a year. republicans are opposed to this tax relief for families that need it. they already blocked renewal of our child tax credit and earned income tax credit expansions, pushing million children back into poverty. republicans also keep trying to repeal our premium tax credit expansions, which will raise health care costs for millions of families. democrats will keep fighting to restore and protect that tax relief, giving tens of millions of families some breathing room again. and president biden has also proposed a $, tax credit for first-time homebuyers and people selling their first homes, to help reduce housing costs for working families. the treasury department and the irs are also making it easier and cheaper for americans to file their taxes and collect the refunds they’re owed. the irs successfully piloted a free, easy-to-use online tool, direct file, which has already saved taxpayers millions of dollars in filing fees. it has since announced that direct file will be a permanent offering, saving users an average $ in filing costs – but republicans keep trying to defund this free tool. making the wealthy & big corporations pay their fair share president biden’s plans will cut taxes for middle-class and low-income americans – and we’ll finance those cuts by making the ultra-wealthy and big corporations finally start paying their fair share. there are a thousand billionaires in america, and they pay an average percent in taxes – a far lower rate than a firefighter or teacher. democrats will make billionaires pay a minimum income tax rate of percent, raising $ billion in years. we’ll end the preferential treatment for capital gains for millionaires, so they pay the same rate on investment income as on wages. we’ll put an end to abusive life insurance tax shelters, and stop billionaires from exploiting retirement tax incentives that are supposed to help middle-class families save. we’ll eliminate the “stepped-up basis” loophole for the wealthiest americans, so they can’t avoid paying taxes on their wealth by passing it down to heirs. democrats will close the “carried interest” loophole, which wealthy fund managers have long used to halve tax rates on their own personal pay, so they pay a lower rate than some teachers or firefighters do. that’s wrong. and, we’ll increase our new stock buyback tax to percent to discourage stock buybacks that benefit executives and wealthy shareholders, instead of workers and consumers. we will also keep upping the pressure on wealthy and corporate tax cheats that fail to pay what they owe. the irs was severely underfunded for years; but democrats are improving irs services for everyday taxpayers and reviving enforcement against wealthy and corporate tax cheats, raising more than an estimated $ billion in additional revenue as a result. the irs has already collected over $ million in unpaid taxes from less than , delinquent millionaires, and launched efforts aimed at thousands of other millionaires who hadn’t filed a return in years. democrats will protect this progress by continuing to invest in modernizing the irs. republicans are working to reverse it, protecting wealthy tax cheats and increasing the deficit instead. democrats will also make billion-dollar companies pay their fair share. in , of the biggest companies in america made $ billion in profit, but paid zero in federal income taxes. corporations are seeing record margins, but their share of federal taxes has fallen below percent, down from percent in the 1950s. it’s wrong. trump doesn’t care: he slashed the corporate tax rate to percent, down from percent. president biden will raise that rate back to percent. and for those billion-dollar tax dodgers, the president signed a historic percent corporate minimum tax into law. he also reached a global minimum tax agreement with countries, so that big multinational companies will no longer be able to pit nations against one another in a race to the bottom. and, biden will double the tax rate that american multinationals pay on foreign earnings to percent; and end incentives, introduced by trump, that encourage companies to shift jobs and operations overseas and book profits in low-tax countries. democrats oppose unfair loopholes and wasteful subsidies that benefit special interests at everyone else’s expense. we will fight to get rid of them. that starts by eliminating tens of billions of dollars in subsidies for oil and gas companies. it means ending special tax breaks for corporate jets, and boosting fuel taxes on corporate and private jet travel, saving taxpayers $ billion over years. and we’ll no longer permit companies to deduct the cost of paying executives more than $ million a year. corporations shouldn’t get a tax break for giving huge pay packages to ceos. we’ll also eliminate the so-called “like-kind exchange” loophole that allows wealthy real estate investors to avoid paying taxes on real estate profits, as long as they keep investing in real estate – a tax break that trump protected for himself and other corporate landlords in his tax scam. no other industry has that kind of sweetheart deal; it ends now. chapter three: lowering costs today, our economy is growing, wages are rising, and a record number of americans have good jobs. but for too many hard-working families, the cost of living is too high. lowering costs is democrats’ number one economic priority. we’re using every tool to bring prices down on health insurance and prescription drugs, including negotiating the price of commonly used drugs for diabetes and heart failure; and on housing, child care, internet, banking, credit cards, and more. we have more to do, but our actions are already putting thousands of dollars a year back in people’s pockets. those savings add up, and democrats will keep fighting until every american feels them. when the pandemic disrupted supply chains, everyday items became hard to get, raising prices. when russia invaded ukraine, food and gas prices spiked more. as companies’ costs went up, they raised prices, too. president biden worked across industries to ease supply bottlenecks and get goods and energy flowing again. he delivered, and inflation has since dropped two-thirds from its peak. but some companies haven’t passed those new savings on to consumers. their costs have come down, but they’ve kept prices high anyway, boosting profits. corporate profits have more than doubled since . last year, after-tax profit ratios for corporations outside the financial sector were their highest in years. president biden’s lowering costs agenda is historic in scope, attacking the issue from every angle to help cut costs for consumers, crack down on price gouging, and get companies to use their record profits to reduce prices long-term. it’s also investing in making things in america again to boost supply, push down prices, and bring jobs home. donald trump hasn’t offered a single solution to lower families’ costs. he wants to drag america backwards, with extreme import tariffs that will make life more expensive for folks nationwide. and for corporations that hiked prices and doubled profits since the pandemic, trump wants to reward them with a massive tax cut. independent analysts say his maga tax and tariff plans will increase inflation, cost million american jobs, and slow growth, triggering a recession in his first year back in office. trump’s plan will increase costs for working families by $, a year. today, america has built its way back into the strongest economic recovery in the world. democrats won’t let trump throw that all away. health care & prescription drugs health care health care should be a right in america, not a privilege. every american deserves the peace of mind that quality, affordable coverage brings. that’s why democrats fought so hard to pass the affordable care act, providing million americans with insurance, guaranteeing protections for million people with preexisting conditions, and protecting nearly million people from lifetime coverage limits. yet even now, years after we passed that landmark law, trump and republicans are still threatening to repeal it. democrats will never let that happen. we’ll never quit fighting to protect and expand the affordable care act, making quality care more accessible and affordable, as the biden-harris administration has done. today, more americans have health insurance than ever in history. coverage is up and costs are down. a record million people signed up through the affordable care act this year, helping to slash the uninsured rate from percent in to under percent now. democrats have expanded the health insurance premium tax credit twice, saving millions of americans an average of $ a year on coverage; and helping an additional . million latinos, , black americans, and , asian americans buy more affordable insurance. republicans want to let those credits expire, increasing premiums. democrats will fight to make them permanent. as democrats, we support medicaid expansion, encouraging states to provide health coverage to low-income americans on the federal government’s tab. the administration has helped over a million people in four states to enroll; and we’ll keep pushing congress to further expand medicaid-like coverage to the . million uninsured low-income adults who live in states where republicans still refuse the help. democrats are working to protect kids’ health coverage as well, by removing financial barriers for the children's health insurance program; and making it easier for families to keep kids on medicaid. president biden’s plan will let families go three years without having to resubmit medicaid paperwork for children younger than six, reducing burdensome red tape. democrats believe that quality, affordable health care should be available in every corner of america. the administration has invested in new mobile health clinics; and in keeping community and rural health centers, lifelines for tens of millions of people, open, well-staffed, and well-equipped. we want to double those investments now. and the administration is cracking down on federally funded health care providers that turn away or otherwise discriminate against people on the basis of race, sex, age, national origin, or disability. democrats will keep working to grow the health care workforce, so workplace and other provider shortages no longer create barriers to quality care and inflate health care costs. we are investing in programs that train primary care practitioners, registered nurses, mental health specialists, and others to work across our health care system, including in rural and low-income areas. the administration is also cracking down on surprise medical billing and junk health insurance, so patients are no longer ambushed by unexpected bills or scammed into buying low-quality health coverage. democrats will expand “no-surprise billing” to include costly ground ambulances; and we’ll keep using antitrust laws to stop hospital, insurance, and big pharma mergers that undermine competition and increase health care prices for consumers. at the same time, democrats will keep fighting to ease the burden of medical debt, which makes it harder for millions of americans to get a mortgage or other loan for the future. democrats provided funding to forgive $ billion in medical debt for nearly million americans; and the administration is urging states to use remaining funds to do more. it already persuaded credit reporting agencies to exclude many medical debts from credit reports, boosting people’s credit scores and prospects for the future. in all, these actions have reduced the total number of americans with listed medical debt from million in to million. democrats will keep pushing to exclude medical debts from credit scoring entirely. democrats also support the administration’s historic work to close fundamental gaps in women’s health care, including by protecting access to reproductive health care. this includes its efforts to reduce maternal mortality, led by vice president harris. she called for states to provide a full year of postpartum coverage for medicaid beneficiaries, with states, the district of columbia, and the u.s. virgin islands now taking that step. the administration is also making transformative investments in women’s health research to find better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat health conditions in women, and to make care more accessible and affordable. and it is leading game-changing work to end cancer as we know it, including through the creation of the advanced research projects agency for health (arpa-h). trump has no plan to reduce health care costs for americans. he and his maga allies have spent years working to repeal the affordable care act, trying and failing over times. now, trump is once again promising to “terminate” the landmark law, gutting coverage for the million americans who rely on it for care. doing so will cost families $, a year, and threaten protections for million americans with pre-existing conditions. it will strip million people of preventative care like cancer screenings, and reduce access to mental health and substance use treatment. a republican repeal will also deny life-changing home care to millions of seniors and people with disabilities, and kick young adults up to age off their parents’ insurance plans. and, it’ll push more of the -plus rural hospitals that are already at risk of closing to shut down. prescription drugs big pharma has ripped off americans for years, charging two and three times more here than in other countries for the exact same medications. nearly three in ten americans can’t afford their prescriptions as a result. instead of working to change that, trump gave drugmakers massive tax breaks that only incentivized them to shift production overseas. president biden, vice president harris, and democrats took on big pharma and won. democrats capped the price of insulin at $ a month, down from as much as $, for nearly million seniors on medicare. and president biden persuaded the nation’s top three insulin makers to lower their prices for everyone. now, we’ll fight to expand that $ cap to cover everyone, saving millions of americans with diabetes nearly $, a year. starting next year, the inflation reduction act also caps total out-of-pocket drug costs at $, a year for millions of seniors and others on medicare. democrats will fight until that cap covers every single american. for the first time, medicare now also has the ability to negotiate lower drug prices, as private insurers and the va have done for decades. it started doing so this year, beginning with commonly used medications for conditions such as diabetes and heart failure. democrats will push to add at least drugs a year to that list, lowering prices for drugs this decade. medicare part-d is also working to cap cost-sharing for life-saving generics at $ a dose; democrats will make this mandatory for all medicare beneficiaries. the administration is also leading the charge against big pharma price gouging, by requiring drugmakers that raise prices faster than inflation to pay the difference back to medicare, which will then pass savings on to consumers. this will protect over , seniors, who could save as much as $, per over-priced dose. democrats will keep fighting to expand these rebates, applying them when drugmakers overcharge not just medicare, but private insurers as well. we’re also cracking down on improper drug patent listings, which some drugmakers use to shut out competition. once companies drop their improper patent listings, other companies will be free to make cheaper alternatives. the ftc’s work in this area has already pushed three of the biggest makers of inhalers to lower prices to $ a month, saving people with asthma hundreds of dollars a year. the administration also enacted rules to finally make hearing aids available over-the-counter, saving millions of americans up to $, a pair. and democrats will continue the administration’s work to require that any drugs developed with taxpayer dollars be available to taxpayers, including at reasonable prices. democrats will keep working to lower drug prices by requiring more transparency from the “pharmacy benefit manager” middlemen who generally decide which drugs are covered by insurance and bought by doctors, and how much they cost. all these actions will benefit family budgets. and they’ll boost the federal budget, too – reducing the deficit by $ billion over the next ten years, as medicare no longer has to pay big pharma exorbitant prices. every democrat in congress voted for the inflation reduction act, the historic law behind these savings. every single republican voted against it – against $ insulin for seniors, against medicare negotiating lower prices, against saving millions of seniors’ money on life-saving drugs. now, trump and his maga allies are promising to repeal it entirely, and to funnel our savings back into big pharma’s pockets. we won’t let that happen. child care, home care, & paid leave child & home care the united states can’t have the best economy in the world without strong support for caregiving. but today, the cost of care is too high, pay for care workers is too low, and families are caught in the middle of a broken system. democrats understand that fixing the caregiving crisis cannot wait. during the pandemic, democrats’ american rescue plan kept , child care centers open, getting parents back to work and saving families an average $, a year per child. it preserved a million care workers’ jobs, and increased their pay by percent. it expanded support for home- and community-based services for seniors and people with disabilities. and not a single republican voted for it. last year, president biden issued a historic executive order directing agencies to further expand access to affordable care. the administration also capped child care costs for , low-income families at percent of their income, saving each an average $, a year. overall, the administration increased federal child care funding by percent. democrats will make investments like these permanent, and guarantee affordable, quality child care to millions of working families for less than $-a-day per child. and we’ll restore the expanded child tax credit and strengthen head start. for seniors and people with disabilities, democrats will improve and expand home- and community-based services, working toward finally eliminating the ,-person medicaid waiting list, so more people can live and work with dignity in their own communities. we’ll also keep pushing to improve pay and benefits for care workers, for example by fighting to get many of them a bigger share of medicaid home care payments. democrats will overhaul the quality of care and quality of life for our nation’s . million nursing home residents by defending administration regulations that require minimum staffing standards at nursing homes. democrats are the only party with a plan to expand access to care, and to make it more affordable and accessible for all. trump and his maga allies in congress have voted repeatedly to increase the cost of care, for example by slashing head start and child care programs, eliminating slots for half a million kids. trump has no plan to lower child care or home care costs for american families. instead, house republicans have promised to slash social security, medicare, medicaid, and the children’s health insurance program, while their continued efforts to repeal the affordable care act will strip millions of seniors and people with disabilities of life-changing home support. paid leave america is the world’s only advanced economy not to guarantee paid leave. the vast majority of employers don’t offer it – nearly three-quarters of private-sector employees don’t have paid family leave through their jobs, including percent of america’s lowest-paid workers. the pandemic only made the economic consequences of this failure more devastating. in the united states of america, no one should have to choose between caring for a parent who raised them, a child who depends on them, and the paycheck that they need to survive. trump and republicans failed to guarantee any new paid leave to private sector workers. instead, their various proposals included unfunded mandates on states, tax credits that failed to expand access but subsidized large businesses, and schemes to force new parents seeking paid leave to borrow against their own future social security funds. from day one, president biden has pushed to do more. he fought to include a comprehensive paid leave program in legislation that ultimately became the inflation reduction act. he instructed federal agencies to expand access to paid and unpaid leave for federal employees. he expanded the military parental leave program, so all active-duty, new-parent servicemembers can take weeks. and his budget includes the strongest paid leave proposals in history, permanently funding the national paid leave plan that america needs. that plan will create america’s first, full, national paid family and medical leave program, guaranteeing every american worker up to weeks of paid time off to care for a new child or loved one to recover from an illness, in cases of domestic violence, or military deployment. it will help families care for one another, and it will help businesses retain valuable talent and small businesses to compete. millions more parents will be able to work, and it will add hundreds of billions to our economy. democrats have pushed for this for decades. it’s past time that america caught up with the rest of the world. gas & groceries when the pandemic crushed supply chains, prices for everyday items, from food to gas to airfare, went up. but after supply bottlenecks eased, many companies didn’t lower prices in line with their falling costs. president biden will keep calling those companies out for price gouging, and hold them accountable when they don’t pass savings on to consumers. to lower prices, democrats will also keep working to boost supply, fix supply chains and promote competition, especially for essential items like gas and groceries that families depend on. through record energy production of clean energy, oil, and gas, we’ve lowered prices at the pump for american families. the administration also released nearly million barrels of gasoline from the strategic petroleum and northeast gasoline supply reserves; and it is lowering gas prices by up to cents per gallon more in certain markets, particularly in the midwest, by making cheaper, e15 ethanol-blended gasoline available each summer. and, the administration is cracking down to prevent collusion by oil companies that could raise prices more. the president also knows the frustration and fear that high grocery prices can cause, and he has taken action to lower costs for hard-working families. he and his team have met repeatedly with grocery ceos and business leaders, who agreed this spring to lower prices. the administration is also cracking down on price gouging and promoting competition in agriculture, making everything from fertilizer to poultry processing more affordable for farmers. the president also signed into law the bipartisan ocean shipping reform act, which lowers shipping prices and helps american farmers export their goods. trump and his maga allies fought these changes all the way, siding with big oil and special interests over working families. instead of standing up to them, trump just wants to give them another massive tax cut. corporate greed today, corporate consolidation is allowing companies to keep raking in historic profits, while continuing to raise prices for working families. in the two decades before president biden came to office, three-quarters of american industries grew more concentrated. as the president often says, capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism, it’s exploitation. and the american people are tired of being played for suckers. the administration has taken historic steps to boost competition across our economy, in fields from finance and farming to technology and transportation. we’re banning non-compete agreements so that workers have the freedom to pursue a new job or start a new business. we’re protecting consumers from unfair hidden “junk fees” and price gouging, and shoring up our banking system to keep people’s hard-earned savings safe. during his first months in office, the president launched a competition council tasked with coordinating and advancing this work. agencies have taken dozens of actions to increase competition across markets and industries – from making hearing aids available over the counter, to reducing cargo and rail shipping costs for goods, to support efforts to allow farmers and other americans to repair their own equipment. the justice department and the ftc have increased antitrust enforcement, releasing updated merger guidelines, and halting a slate of big mergers in the airline, food, and defense sectors that would’ve increased consumer prices. democrats will keep working to make the american economy more competitive for businesses and workers across sectors, from transportation to housing to food. and we will reform hiring and procurement processes across the government, to boost competition among our contractors and suppliers, too. the administration is also taking broad action to crack down on “junk fees,” the hidden charges that companies add on to people’s bills without their knowledge, reducing consumer choice. we’ve already taken action to crack down on a range of these junk fees charged by airlines, internet providers, hotels, and apartment buildings. we’ve pushed banks to slash unfair overdraft and bounced check charges and took action to cap credit card late fees. we’re cracking down on junk health insurance plans that advertise one rate, but then stick patients with a much bigger medical bill. over time, these combined actions will save american families hundreds and even thousands of dollars a year – adding up to more than $ billion a year across the economy – giving people a little more breathing room. and we’ll keep pushing until we ban all junk fees across our economy. democrats are also working to shore up a safe, secure banking system that protects consumer deposits and holds investors accountable. democrats have pushed for legislation to hold executives at all failed banks accountable, clawing back compensation and banning them from the industry. we’re working to limit out-of-control wall street bonuses that encourage risky bank practices that jeopardize our whole economy. and we’ll keep pushing to pass an updated glass-steagall act, more clearly separating commercial and investment banking and expanding volcker rule safeguards. we defeated republican efforts to gut the consumer financial protection bureau at the supreme court this year; we’ll continue to protect and strengthen that agency and support its critical work. housing a home is more than a roof over your head, it’s a place to raise your family, to build community, and to grow the american dream. it’s also the biggest investment, and the biggest monthly expense, that most people ever face. some years after the subprime mortgage crisis devastated homeowners and froze construction nationwide, we’re still seeing the effect of a severe housing shortage that’s pushing up prices and keeping homes out of reach. president biden has taken historic steps to help americans rent, buy, and build. in the depth of the pandemic, the american rescue plan kept million families in their homes nationwide by preventing foreclosures and evictions. since then, the administration has eased rising rents by capping rent hikes in million federally-funded apartments. it led the biggest expansion of rental assistance for low-income families in years. it’s cracking down on slumlords who don’t play by the rules. the administration has reduced mortgage-insurance premiums on federally-backed loans for , homeowners; and waived the requirement for title insurance, saving families up to $, to refinance. the relief is helping. more people own homes today than did before the pandemic, and we’re seeing fewer foreclosures than at any time in decades. but democrats know the surest way to bring housing costs down long-term is to build to boost supply. so the administration is cutting red tape to help more builders get federal financing. a record . million new housing units are under construction today nationwide. going forward, the president has laid out one of america’s most ambitious housing plans in over years. it expands rental assistance to a half-million new households, including to low-income veterans and young people aging out of foster care. it offers corporate landlords a basic choice for the next two years: either cap rent increases at percent, or lose a valuable federal tax break. it offers a $, mortgage-relief tax credit to first-time homebuyers, and $, in down-payment assistance to buyers from families where no one has ever before owned a home. at the same time, the administration is going after unfair rental “junk fees,” like fees people are charged just to pay rent online or to receive sorted mail. and, we will crack down on corporate landlords who are gouging tenants, for example by capping the amount they can raise the rent each year; and we will go after negligent landlords who don’t maintain basic habitability standards. we will also crack down on those who violate the fair housing act, and on landlords who discriminate against low-income and minority renters and people with housing vouchers. we are rooting bias out of the home appraisal process, which perpetuates the racial wealth gap by unjustly undervaluing millions of black- and latino-owned homes. the president’s plan also calls for funding to help build or renovate million homes nationwide – by expanding the low-income housing tax credit for developers to build affordable rental housing; and by introducing a new neighborhood homes tax credit, the first ever to focus on creating affordable housing not for renters, but for homeowners. it also creates a housing innovation fund, to help state and local governments find new ways to increase supply, like by converting empty office or hotel space into apartments. the plan also encourages state and local efforts to take on barriers to building new housing. democrats are dedicated to increasing the supply of an array of housing options like duplexes, triplexes, and townhomes that bridge the gap between single-family homes and large apartment buildings. by reducing barriers to building housing and providing federal tax incentives for the development of housing for people of all incomes, we can foster vibrant, inclusive communities where people from all walks of life can find affordable, diverse living options. workforce housing must also be prioritized to ensure that our nation’s teachers, nurses, firefighters, and other essential workers can afford to live in the communities they serve. we recognize that these workers are the backbone of our society, but they are left to struggle with housing costs that outpace their incomes, leaving them unable to live near their workplaces. democrats will meet this challenge head-on by increasing funding for programs that support the creation and preservation of affordable housing options for essential workers, as well as collaborating with state and local governments to accelerate the development of workforce housing , ensuring that our communities remain accessible and affordable for all. democrats are working to help americans cover other housing-related costs, like utilities. families are already saving thousands of dollars with clean energy tax credits; and million households received free or monthly discounts, saving $ to $ per month on high-speed broadband through the largest internet affordability program in history. it expired in may, because republicans refused to act; but democrats will keep fighting to reinstate it. we’ll keep working to expand other programs that reduce home heating, cooling, and water bills as well, especially in rural areas; and to speed the transition to cheaper renewable energy, like solar, that will lower people’s bills long-term. the administration is also leading one of america’s most ambitious efforts to prevent homelessness. based on a “housing first” principle, it’s helping states and cities prioritize housing as the foundational step in delivering support, services, and jobs to rebuild lives. the administration will work with congress and local jurisdictions to increase supportive and interim housing options, and the services necessary to help unhoused individuals stay permanently housed. instead of trying to solve the problem, trump has made it worse. trump has never done anything to ease america’s long-standing housing shortage. in fact, he and his allies benefit directly from the housing shortage. the higher the rent, the more that he and his rich real-estate friends earn. for decades, he made a career of inflating rents and putting homeownership out of folks’ reach. as a landlord, he was sued for race-based housing discrimination; and he was accused of cutting off tenants’ water and heat, to push them out and charge new tenants more. as president, he tried every year to triple rent for low-income americans in subsidized housing, including the elderly and people with disabilities; and to gut policies that help black and latino families access fair housing. now, trump and his maga allies are vowing to gut president biden’s historic work. senate republicans this spring blocked a bipartisan bill that would’ve provided tax credits to build , affordable homes; and they’ve repeatedly tried to cut affordable housing and rental assistance programs, preferring to protect tax breaks for corporate landlords like trump instead. they will weaken the independent agencies that protect consumers from rent gouging, and they will make it harder for working families to buy a home, by reinstating higher mortgage insurance premiums, and by privatizing fannie mae and freddie mac, a windfall to hedge funds. education democrats fundamentally believe that every student deserves a quality education, regardless of their parents’ zip code or income. we know that education starts well before kids go to kindergarten. studies show that children who attend preschool are nearly percent more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a two- or four-year degree, no matter their background. that’s why democrats will provide free, universal preschool for four-year olds, saving the families of million children $, a year. in the wake of the pandemic, that’s especially urgent. the american rescue plan made the biggest investment in public education in history, providing $ billion to help , districts reopen, rebuild, and catch kids up; funding that has worked to help our children learn. the historic investment spurred long overdue improvements in school facilities and indoor air quality, creating safe and healthy learning environments for students and school staff. since then, we’ve also provided an additional $ billion to high-need, title i schools. we’ve helped districts nationwide train and hire , more counselors and social workers, so kids can heal from the disruptions of covid, and cope with the fear of gun violence in order to focus on learning. we increased investments in full-service community schools five-fold , providing health care, nutrition, job training, and other wraparound services for kids at school, investing in their futures and making families’ lives easier. the administration supports a multitude of approaches that have been proven to help students learn: reducing chronic absenteeism by building social and emotional supports at schools, offering literacy programs, and setting high expectations for student attendance; providing intensive tutoring; extending the school day and school year; expanding community schools; and helping schools to lift student achievement, rather than punishing them based on state standardized tests. we support fully funding idea to prioritize students with disabilities and the special educator workforce. we support efforts to provide more timely, well-rounded, actionable feedback on student learning and progress to educators and to families that will support instruction and student success, while upholding rigorous academic standards. we oppose the use of private-school vouchers, tuition tax credits, opportunity scholarships, and other schemes that divert taxpayer-funded resources away from public education. public tax dollars should never be used to discriminate. and we’ll continue working to increase accountability at charters, holding them to the same transparency standards as public schools. we’ll prioritize education in cutting-edge steam fields as well, especially for students from underrepresented communities, preparing every child to compete and thrive. and we’re working to provide every student with a pathway to multilingual education, while ensuring equitable access to a high-quality education for english learners, who’ve historically been underserved. a quality, postsecondary education used to be a ticket to the middle class, but the cost that many folks face for higher education today is crippling families, futures, and our entire economy. it has become a barrier to opportunity. democrats will make quality, affordable, postsecondary education a path forward again. four year college is not the only pathway to a good career, so democrats are investing in other forms of education as well, including career and technical education. the administration is expanding job training partnerships that connect high schools, local businesses, and labor unions to prepare students for good jobs in high-skill, high-wage, and in-demand industries. it’ll make trade school and community college free for every american. and it’s making record investments in registered apprenticeships – which already train more than one million americans a year across industries, including cutting-edge industries. some percent of them stay on as full hires, earning an average starting salary of $, a year. that’s a path to the middle class that families can count on. a majority of college students graduate with student debt. it can be an overwhelming stress, as snowballing interest follows folks for decades, defining the choices they make and the jobs they take, and holding back our entire economy. although republican appointees on the supreme court blocked the president's initial student debt relief plan for million borrowers, he has not stopped using every available tool to provide relief. his administration already approved the cancellation of $ billion in loans for nearly million borrowers, including nearly a million public servants like teachers, nurses, and police; and it has outlined plans to deliver relief to million borrowers in all. meanwhile, its new save plan is the most affordable student-loan repayment plan in history, helping million americans – including more than . million who now have a $ monthly payment. these savings will transform lives, freeing people to buy a house, to start a family, or to launch a business with new hope. for young people just heading to college now, we’ve already secured the largest increase in pell grants in a decade, and we’ll further expand these grants to million more students, and double the maximum award by . we’ve invested a record $ billion in historically black colleges and universities (hbcus); and we’re working to subsidize tuition at all minority serving institutions for anyone whose family earns less than $, a year. while democrats work to make the promise of education available to everyone, trump just sees school as another opportunity for a scam. trump university not only conned thousands of people into buying worthless degrees, it saddled them with thousands in debt. and, not only are republicans trying to block our student debt relief, they are slashing funding for job training that ensures workers can access good paying jobs without a four-year degree. at the same time, democrats have educators’ backs. teachers, education support professionals, paraprofessional and school-related personnel, and specialized instructional support personnel are the heart and soul of our communities; they give so much of themselves, and inspire our children to dream. the administration has canceled student loan debts for more than , public servants, including educators. public school educators also deserve a raise. we’ll recruit more new teachers, paraprofessionals and school related personnel, and education support professionals, with the option for some to even start training in high school; and we’ll help school-support staff to advance in their own careers with a living wage. we will improve working conditions and support to help make teaching a sustainable and affordable profession. we’ll keep investing in partnerships with hbcus, msis, and tribal colleges and universities to strengthen and diversify the teacher pipeline, so students of every background can see themselves at the head of the classroom and in charge of their schools. social security, pensions, & medicare the right to a secure and dignified retirement is one of the bedrock principles of american life. before social security, almost half of american seniors lived in poverty. even those who’d spent a lifetime working didn't always have enough to put food on the table or health care they could count on. democrats changed that: in , we passed social security; in , we signed medicare and medicaid into law. these are more than government programs – they’re a promise that we’ve made as a country, that after a lifetime of hard work, people deserve to retire with dignity and security. they’ve made tens of millions of lives better. trump and his maga allies are shredding that sacred trust, and saying they’ll cut social security to give billionaires another tax cut. trump has called social security a “ponzi scheme” and warned “there’s a lot you can do in terms of cutting.” as president, he tried to slash both social security and medicare programs in every budget, and to gut medicaid, which provides home care to over seven million seniors and people with disabilities. house republicans have vowed to cut social security by over $. trillion, to raise the retirement age, and to transform medicare into a voucher-like system, threatening the program. trump will also eliminate protections for private retirement savings, by undermining the consumer financial protection bureau and making it easier for banks to rip off seniors with expensive, hidden fees. democrats won’t let that happen. generations of americans have paid into these programs, with every paycheck of their lives. we’ll never back down from our ironclad commitment to protecting social security, medicare, and medicaid. we reject any effort to privatize social security or to cut any of the benefits that the american people have earned. middle-class americans pay . percent of their income to support social security, and the self-employed pay twice that. but people with multi-million dollar incomes pay a fraction of percent. we’ll strengthen the program and expand benefits by asking the wealthiest americans to pay their fair share. we also oppose any actions to cut medicare benefits. we’ll look to expand traditional medicare coverage to include dental, vision, and hearing services, which are so key to health and quality of life, by making the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share. the fact is that both social security and medicare are in a stronger fiscal position today than when president biden took office. our strong economic recovery has helped to extend medicare solvency by a decade. and the president’s prescription drug reforms will save it hundreds of billions of dollars, by finally empowering medicare to directly negotiate lower prices with drug companies, and to collect rebates if big pharma hikes prices faster than inflation. if republicans repeal our reforms, they’ll erase those savings and put medicare itself at risk. democrats will make medicare permanently solvent, by making the wealthy pay their fair share in medicare taxes. democrats will stand firm to protect retirement security across the board. in , we passed the butch-lewis act, preserving the pensions of million union workers and retirees who would’ve seen deep cuts, and reversing pension cuts for over , workers. going forward, we’ll amend federal bankruptcy laws to make sure no other retirees ever run that same risk. the administration is also cracking down on junk fees in retirement savings, and reversed a trump-era rule that had allowed financial advisors to put their own interests before their clients’. democrats want to make it easier for everyone to save for retirement and retire with dignity. chapter four: tackling the climate crisis, lowering energy costs, & securing energy independence every year, the devastation caused by climate change grows more urgent. across the country, americans experience the dire impacts of climate change: floods and storms wipe more homes off the map. wildfire smoke spreads thousands of miles, forcing millions to shelter indoors. we’ve had the worst droughts in a thousand years, and the fastest sea-level rise in over a century. last year was earth’s hottest on record. natural disasters and extreme weather have cost america over one trillion dollars in damages in just the last seven years. and they hit the most vulnerable among us hardest – seniors, people with disabilities, people in neighborhoods without resources to blunt the impact. the climate crisis is decades in the making, an existential threat to future generations who deserve better. it’s a consequence of delay and destruction by people like donald trump and his friends in big oil, who still deny what we all see happening right before our eyes. president biden is delivering on the most aggressive climate agenda in history. his landmark legislation has unleashed a clean energy boom that’s slashing pollution, lowering energy costs, and has already created over , good-paying american clean energy jobs. america is now producing more energy than ever in its history. he has taken more environmental actions than any president before him – providing cleaner air and water, making communities more resilient, and forcing polluters to pay for the damage they’ve done. he is on track to protect more of america’s lands and waters than any president before him, and he has restored our global climate leadership. he is positioning america to lead the future – energy independent, resilient, innovative, and strong. trump is only interested in himself and his wealthy donors, who got rich polluting our country. as president, he gutted more than environmental policies that had protected the american people from toxic pollution, everywhere from sewage plants, to oil and gas fields, to our own homes. he pulled out of the paris climate agreement at big oil’s urging, weakening america’s role in the world. he fired scientists from federal agencies, replacing them with oil and gas lobbyists who rewrote our nation’s environmental rules. and he handed oil companies $ billion in tax breaks. now, trump is set to do big oil’s and polluters’ bidding again. he told oil executives he’d reverse our climate progress and slash their taxes once more – if they’d give him $ billion for his campaign. oil and gas lobbyists are already drafting executive orders for him to sign on day one. he wants to roll back the clean energy progress that president biden has made, gut the environmental protection agency, and let polluters dump dangerous pfas chemicals in our water. his maga allies have tried times to repeal our landmark climate law. if they succeed, they’ll eliminate tens of thousands of good-paying jobs, drive up home energy costs, sicken thousands of americans with toxic pollution, and cede the race for the future to china. producing cleaner, more affordable energy across the world, we’re seeing massive new clean energy production and uptake. we’re at the dawn of a new era that will redefine the global economy, and that america must lead. president biden’s investing in america agenda makes the largest clean-energy investment in history; and it has already attracted over $ billion in private sector commitments, to develop and manufacture solar, wind, battery, and other clean technologies here at home. today, new clean energy manufacturing projects are underway – not just on the coasts, but in states, including in places too often left behind. some percent of the investments made since our landmark climate law passed are going to counties with below-average weekly wages. america is making leaps forward in energy generation and storage, while modernizing our electricity grid and upgrading transmission lines to deliver reliable, clean power. private sector companies have announced investment in solar modules that will power million homes; and the biden-harris administration has approved the first nine commercial offshore wind projects in federal waters, set to power nearly million homes. large-scale energy storage capacity has increased twelve-fold since the president took office, and is expected to double again by year’s end. this clean energy boom has already created over , jobs and lowered energy costs for millions of families. it puts us on track to triple clean-energy generation by , reducing big oil’s hold on our economy, protecting families from wild price swings, and bringing america closer to energy independence than we’ve been in over years. going forward, democrats will keep working to incentivize investment in transmission upgrades and new lines, and in the grid-component manufacturing that’s needed to support that growth. we will improve and speed up the processes of environmental review and clean-energy permitting; and further scale up development of clean energy on public lands. we’ll also continue to invest in clean energy research and development, building on america’s legacy as a nation of new frontiers and possibilities. to help find new ways of generating and storing energy, reducing emissions, and boosting climate resilience, we’ll launch an advanced research projects agency for climate (arpa-c), modeled on the defense research agency that’s behind breakthrough technologies like the internet and gps, and the new arpa-h that the administration created to transform medicine. we’ll also establish a new national lab for climate research and innovation, affiliated with an hbcu, hispanic-, or other minority-serving institution, to ensure the opportunities of the future are available to everyone, and built by everyone. and we will continue to invest in climate research across nasa, noaa, the national science foundation, and other agencies, to make sure that america leads the world in clean energy innovation. lowering energy costs democrats’ historic climate and clean energy agenda is lowering energy costs for families and small businesses long-term and today – with cheaper, cleaner energy and with tax credits to make home energy use more efficient and affordable. america’s clean energy boom is giving everyone more energy choices than ever, and more choices mean lower prices. according to the department of energy, our policies are expected to slash overall electricity rates by percent and gas prices by as much as percent by , saving americans tens of billions of dollars. at the same time, the inflation reduction act is providing tax credits and rebates to make americans’ homes more efficient, so families can immediately start saving on their energy costs, now and for years to come. families can reduce their bills up to $, a year by making their homes more energy efficient with new insulation, windows, and doors; and by installing rooftop solar panels, home battery storage, and electric pumps for heating and cooling. democrats are also offering rebates on new, energy-efficient appliances; and people can save up to $, when they buy a new plug-in hybrid or fully electric car, or $, if they buy a used one. the administration has toughened efficiency standards on new appliances and cars as well, which will further reduce emissions and energy bills. new fuel economy and tailpipe standards alone are expected to save drivers some $, per car by reducing fuel and maintenance costs. the administration has also taken historic action to lower gas prices at the pump, by standing up to big oil’s price gouging, releasing strategic reserves to blunt profiteering, and promoting competition with cleaner, cheaper, renewable fuel. creating clean energy jobs president biden has long said that when he thinks about climate change, he thinks about jobs. good-paying union jobs that people can raise a family on. as president, he’s delivering. the clean energy manufacturing and deployment boom ignited by his landmark climate law has so far directly created over , jobs in communities nationwide; and we’re making sure those jobs meet rigorous worker and environmental safety standards. the legislation is helping to push american factory construction to an all-time high as well, as we build new plants to make things like batteries and electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines, and bring the supply chains needed to power a clean energy future home. the president’s agenda also includes extended buy clean and buy america standards, requiring federal projects to use low-carbon, american-made cement, steel, and other materials; and providing credits for private companies to do the same, creating more american jobs. it also provides extra incentives for private companies to hire registered apprentices and pay prevailing wages. through executive action and with congress, democrats will continue to work to create strong labor standards for jobs created with taxpayer dollars. to help prepare people for these jobs, democrats launched the american climate corps, a new workforce training and service initiative that will put more than , young americans to work on clean energy, conservation, and climate resilience projects nationwide. president biden has set a goal to triple the size of the american climate corps by the end of this decade, ensuring that young people are given the skills and tools they need to succeed in careers in our new clean energy and climate resilience economies. the administration is also making record investments in registered apprenticeships, including in clean energy industries. registered apprenticeships train more than a million americans a year across industries, percent of whom stay on in those jobs as full hires. we’re also boosting investment in stem education and workforce training programs for women and at historically black colleges and universities and other minority serving institutions, to make sure the clean energy and manufacturing jobs of tomorrow are open and accessible to communities that have been too often left out in the past. the administration is also investing in new sources of income for america’s farmers, and working to make our farm sector the world’s first to reach net-zero emissions by . under president biden’s landmark climate law, the agriculture department is paying farmers to adopt climate-smart practices, which sequester carbon from the atmosphere, improve soil health and biodiversity, and restore water cycles, all while opening new revenue streams from ecosystem services markets. already, over , farms covering million acres have adopted these practices. above all, democrats will unite against the republican war on clean energy, blocking their obsessive attempts to repeal president biden’s clean energy investments. republicans will not be allowed to pull the rug out from american clean energy businesses, send hundreds of thousands of jobs overseas, and strip all americans of cheaper, cleaner energy choices, all to please their special interest backers. reducing pollution & making polluters pay these transformative investments in american energy are lowering energy costs, creating good-paying jobs, revitalizing local economies, and reducing pollution. transportation is america’s biggest emitter, responsible for a third of emissions. the administration has put us on track to eliminate all carbon from the sector by . it’s making generational investments in transportation infrastructure, including in cleaner shipping, trucking, transit, rail, and aviation. it issued the toughest-ever fuel economy and tailpipe standards, so new cars both get better mileage, and reduce emissions per mile by as much as percent. with tax credits, democrats helped quadruple sales of electric vehicles, with the goal that percent of all new passenger cars sold in the u.s. by be electric. we’re protecting american children from asthma-related diesel pollution by giving school districts rebates to buy thousands of electric school buses so kids don’t have to breathe polluted air. we’ll keep working to electrify the nation’s fleet of school buses, transit buses, and federal vehicles, including the u.s. postal service fleet. we’ll double funding to repair and expand active transportation and public transit, reducing pollution and traffic, and connecting people to jobs and opportunity. and we’ll work to electrify our ports and waterways, prioritizing progress towards a goal of zero-emissions freight. we’ll keep pushing to reduce emissions from america's buildings and heavy industry. we support local and state efforts to adopt energy-efficient building codes. we’ll require that low-carbon materials and clean power be used in all new federal buildings by , and invest in upgrading va hospitals, federal offices, and k- public school and community college buildings, making them innovative, energy efficient, and safe places to learn. and we’ll support investments in heavy industry, to make america the leader in clean steel, cement, aluminum, and other products. we’ll also keep stepping up action to crack down on other forms of air and water pollution, repairing damage done by trump’s failed oversight, and making polluters pay. the administration has strengthened dozens of environmental and safety standards to reduce smog, soot, carbon, methane, mercury, and other toxic pollutants in our communities. after years of inadequate protections, we finally banned all cancer-causing asbestos, including from homes, cars, and water filtration sites. and we prohibited the use of chlorpyrifos, a pesticide that can sicken farmworkers and children. we also set america’s first national drinking water standard to finally protect local water supplies from pollution with pfas, toxic “forever chemicals” linked to cancer. through the bipartisan infrastructure law, we’re upgrading wastewater systems. and we’re replacing every toxic lead pipe in america – long-overdue work that will finally guarantee that every person in the country can turn on the faucet and drink clean water. the bipartisan infrastructure law also includes important work to speed the cleanup of toxic superfund and brownfield sites that have leached poisonous waste into nearby neighborhoods for decades. to cover those costs, the law finally restored a vital “polluter pays” tax that had lapsed years before, once again collecting revenue on any chemical sold in the united states, and directing it to the superfund trust fund to pay for cleanup. at the same time, the administration has greatly increased civil and criminal enforcement of our nation’s environmental laws, boosting funding for the justice department and environmental protection agency, resulting in faster cleanups and tougher compliance. we support increased monitoring, transparency, and community engagement in this work. throughout, we’ll keep standing up to big oil, as our clean energy boom breaks the industry’s monopoly hold on energy markets. for the first time in years, we’ve increased the royalties that oil and gas companies have to pay to drill or mine on public lands; and we’re charging at least times more for the bonds that are required to hold companies accountable for cleaning up drilling sites or capping their abandoned wells, which have been left to spew methane. states and private landowners have for years charged more than the federal government does to lease their lands; it’s time the taxpayers got a similar return. going forward, we’ll also eliminate tens of billions of dollars in other unfair oil and gas subsidies. when windfall profiteering causes prices to spike at the pump, we’ll release our own supplies to keep costs down for american families. and, when we hear of potential collusion or price-gouging, we’ll hold oil and gas executives accountable. environmental justice for too long in this country, too many communities have been denied the basic security and dignity that comes from having clean air, clean water, and functioning infrastructure. too many parents still lay awake at night worrying what the rain or soil or water or air is doing to their kids. that kind of inequity goes against everything that we stand for as a nation. to finally change that, president biden’s climate agenda includes the most ambitious environmental justice actions in history, making sure that the people who’ve suffered most from legacy pollution can now share in the benefits. during his first week in office, the president established the justice40 initiative, with the goal of directing percent of the benefits of our historic climate and clean energy investments to fenceline communities hit hardest by past pollution. last year, he gave the program new teeth, with an executive order requiring every federal agency to designate its own environmental justice officer to consider and improve the health impacts of its work on all communities. every major plank of our investing in america agenda shares that commitment to environmental justice. the bipartisan infrastructure law invests a record $ billion in tackling legacy pollution, the biggest effort to right such wrongs in american history. we’re also investing in capping orphaned oil and gas wells, which leak deadly methane into surrounding communities well after big oil is gone. and to help ensure new climate and clean energy projects can get financed across america, particularly in communities historically left behind and overburdened by pollution, president biden and vice president harris launched a first-of-its-kind $ billion national financing network as part of the greenhouse gas reduction fund. this program will ensure communities across the country have access to the capital they need to participate in and benefit from a cleaner, more sustainable economy as we slash harmful climate pollution, improve air quality, lower energy costs, and create good-paying jobs. our climate law makes major investments in long-overdue clean water and sanitation as well. it launched a clean ports program to help ease the impact of air pollution around ports and airports, where thousands of trucks move goods in and out, often through neighborhoods experiencing distress as a result of historic disinvestment. it invests in clean public transit, connecting communities that have been isolated or disconnected by infrastructure and development to jobs, healthcare, education and opportunities. and under this climate law, millions of trees will be planted, deploying a nature-based solution to combat the urban heat island effect by cooling our streets and easing the deadly impact of extreme heat on people living and working in these areas. we will continue to implement the president’s executive order on environmental justice for all, and will seek legislative options to further advance environmental justice. democrats also know we have a moral obligation to make sure that fenceline communities benefit from the clean energy revolution. programs like solar for all are helping to lower energy costs, by installing nearly a million solar rooftops in low-income areas by . at the same time, we’re providing bonus tax credits to draw clean energy and clean manufacturing to former fossil fuel and legacy power plant communities. they powered our nation for generations and deserve a just transition away from fossil fuels. today, they’re seeing rapid growth. building climate resilient communities we have an urgent obligation to make every community in america more resilient to climate change and extreme weather. a record more than , americans died after extreme heat exposure last year, making it the top weather-related killer; while as a country, we had to build back from separate billion-dollar weather and climate disasters. it’s not sustainable. the president’s infrastructure and climate laws are improving our climate resilience by boosting readiness and response, including by recruiting and retaining more wildland firefighters, and increasing budgets at fema. and, they’re preparing us to better mitigate the impact of each extreme weather event as well. we’ve taken unprecedented steps to reinforce our nation’s infrastructure, building new roads, bridges, and ports that are less vulnerable to flooding. we’re putting power lines underground, so winds can’t bring them down where they catch fire. we’re making our electric grids more reliable and more energy efficient, so families and businesses don’t lose power in critical moments. we’re restoring wetlands to help protect communities from sea-level rise and storm surge. we’ve stabilized the colorado river system, which provides water for more than million americans, after the worst drought in over a thousand years. we’ll continue investing in public safety measures, like resiliency and cooling centers, so everyone, including our most vulnerable residents, can find refuge during extreme weather events. and we’re looking out for workers, who often risk their lives on the job in extreme weather, with president biden for example introducing the first national heat standards to protect workers from dangerous heat last year. going forward, democrats will work to pass the bipartisan disaster resilience tax credit, to help low- and middle-income families and small businesses invest in preparing for and easing the impact of storms, heat, floods, and other natural disasters. trump refuses to admit that climate change, and any of the devastating impacts that communities nationwide, are real. his allies have promised to privatize the national weather service, downsize the national oceanic and atmospheric administration, and stop the office of oceanic and atmospheric research from conducting climate research, making it much harder to predict when extreme weather is coming, respond or help communities recover. conservation america’s natural wonders are our nation’s heart and soul. they unite and inspire us, and connect us to something bigger than ourselves. from his first day in office, president biden has taken historic steps to protect, conserve, and restore them. he set our nation’s first-ever national conservation goal to protect at least percent of our lands and waters by , including by supporting locally-led, voluntary efforts. today, he is on track to conserve more american lands and waters than any president in history – over million acres so far, including dozens of new national monuments, wildlife refuges, and other protected areas, from the grand canyon to the great lakes. trump is the only president in history to have stripped more public lands of protection than he designated, opening tens of millions of acres of our most pristine national monuments to mining and drilling. the administration has reversed that, canceling leases in the arctic national wildlife refuge and prohibiting new leasing in minnesota’s boundary waters; restoring important protections for places like grand staircase-escalante national monument and bears ears national monument in utah and expanding the san gabriel mountains national monument in california; and protecting places that are too special to develop, like alaska’s bristol bay. going forward, democrats will increase protections for america’s arctic, and ensure clean water for all americans by protecting rivers and wetlands. we’ll protect our oceans by working to designate new marine sanctuaries, and protect coastal communities from climate impacts. we’ll keep pushing to fully fund the land and water conservation fund, partnering with state and local governments; and work to reduce threats to iconic old growth forests. we’ll reward americans across the country who engage in voluntary conservation on private lands, and we’ll work with landowners to protect endangered species and our economy by restoring habitats and enhancing biodiversity, and continuing to protect lands and waters as national monuments. global climate leadership with these historic actions and sustained engagement, president biden has restored america’s global climate leadership, once again making our nation the world’s pivotal force against climate change. the united states rejoined the paris climate agreement on day one of his presidency, and president biden set an ambitious goal to reach net-zero emissions by , in line with climate science. he used the restored power of america’s example to press other nations to do more, persuading countries to agree to slash methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas, by at least percent by the end of this decade. the united states is increasing the resilience, diversity, and security of our clean energy supply chains, while making sure they reflect our values, including by creating good-paying, safe jobs for workers. the administration has rallied the world to commit for the first time to transitioning away from fossil fuels. it set a bold new goal for nations to triple renewable energy worldwide and to double energy efficiency by ; and it helped to launch a new global clean-energy supply chain partnership to make that happen. as democrats, we believe the united states has an indispensable role to play in solving the climate crisis, and we have an obligation to help other nations carry out this work. america’s leadership in domestic clean energy development is driving a global cycle of innovation and investment that will help lower the cost of clean energy technologies in a fair and transparent way for all nations. we believe that international climate finance is an important tool in this fight. that’s why the administration committed to achieve $ billion dollars of climate financing a year by , to help develop the international clean energy market. and it worked with other nations to achieve a landmark global goal of mobilizing $ billion in collective climate financing by , fulfilling a promise of the paris agreement. going forward, we’ll continue to support efforts to boost funding for initiatives like prepare, our program to build out better early warning systems for climate impacts in critical regions of the globe. we will use america’s leadership to drive global innovation and build out clean energy supply chains. we’ll work through the multilateral development bank to elevate climate and clean energy priorities within the global development finance system. and we’ll build on our leadership in innovative debt-for-nature swaps, which have helped countries from barbados to gabon to restructure over $ billion in debt so far, unlocking hundreds of millions of dollars for nature and climate investments. chapter five: protecting communities & tackling the scourge of gun violence all americans deserve freedom from fear: to be confident that their children will come home safely from the store or the playground, and to know that their loved one will come home safely from their shift policing the streets. young americans deserve a president who’s fighting to keep guns out of school. women deserve a president who has worked his whole life to end violence against women. families deserve a president who has delivered safer neighborhoods. under president biden, in the murder rate saw the sharpest decrease in history and violent crime fell to one of the lowest levels in more than years. he defeated the gun lobby and passed the first significant federal gun safety law in nearly years. and, democrats provided funding for communities to hire more police. during donald trump’s last year in office, murders surged by nearly percent, the highest increase recorded in modern history. trump tells families traumatized by gun violence to “get over it” and brags that he did nothing about guns. his budgets repeatedly cut law enforcement funding. americans deserve the freedom to be safe, and america is safer today than when president biden first took office. gun safety the gun violence epidemic is a scourge ripping apart our communities; it is the leading cause of death for children and teens. mass shootings at schools, grocery stores, houses of worship, dancehalls, and nightclubs, as well as daily gun violence at home and on streets, devastate american families. president biden has been fighting and beating the gun lobby for decades, and he’s continued to do so as president. with his leadership, congress passed the bipartisan safer communities act (bsca), the first significant federal gun safety law in nearly years. it includes the first-ever federal gun trafficking and straw purchasing law, enhanced background checks for gun purchasers under the age of , funding to implement red flag laws, a narrowing of the “boyfriend loophole” to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, and new requirements so all gun dealers now must conduct background checks no matter where or how they sell their merchandise. and, the law helps schools hire and train an estimated , school-based mental health professionals, including counselors, psychologists, and social workers. president biden also established the first-ever white house office of gun safety prevention - led by vice president harris - and took nearly gun safety executive actions, including going after dangerous “ghost guns.” he launched new law enforcement strike forces within the department of justice to crack down on gun trafficking. while president biden has stood up to the gun lobby, trump is proud of doing their bidding. he stood before the nra convention this year and said, “during my four years nothing happened. and there was great pressure on me having to do with guns. we did nothing. we didn’t yield.” while he “did nothing,” gun violence spiked: trump oversaw the largest single-year increase in murders in history, including a percent increase in gun murders. he refused to limit the use of high-capacity magazines after a las vegas shooter used a dozen -round magazines to kill people. and, when confronted with horrific gun violence, he told families to “get over it.” democrats will establish universal background checks, a step supported by the vast majority of americans, including gun owners. we will once again ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. we will require safe storage for guns. democrats will end the gun industry’s immunity from liability, so gunmakers can no longer escape accountability. we will pass a national red flag law to prevent tragedies by keeping weapons out of dangerous hands. we will increase funding to the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, and firearms (atf) for enforcement and prosecution, and to the federal bureau of investigation (fbi) for firearm background checks. and, because the gun violence epidemic is a public health crisis, we will fund gun violence research across the centers for disease control (cdc) and national institutes of health (nih) as well as community violence interventions. policing & public safety president biden recognizes the sacrifices police officers and their families make to keep our communities safe. every day, officers risk their lives for the safety of people they do not know. and since day one, president biden has been working to make sure police officers have the tools they need to protect their communities, including more police officers on the street. we need to fund the police, not defund the police. democrats passed and president biden signed the american rescue plan, with the largest-ever federal investment in fighting and preventing crime, reducing violence, and investing in public safety. that funding enabled cities and states to invest more than $ billion in public safety and violence prevention, putting more police officers on the beat for accountable community policing, as well as interrupting and preventing crime. in , the justice department provided $. billion tostate, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement agencies, research institutions, and nonprofits to advance public safety – including funding for , new police officers in nearly communities. because police officers should be able to focus on fighting crime, president biden secured the first-ever federal funding solely dedicated to community violence intervention programs; and he increased funding for crisis interventions, mobile crisis teams, and training for first responders and law enforcement. president biden also signed legislation replenishing the crime victims fund, which supports programs that assist survivors. democrats also secured funding for extra security at places of worship and community institutions; and we are investing in tribal public safety. public trust, as any police officer will tell you, is the foundation of public safety. police cannot fulfill their role to keep communities safe without public trust and confidence in law enforcement and in the criminal justice system. yet, there are places in america today where the bonds of trust are frayed or broken. president biden took action to enhance public trust by signing a historic executive order on police reform alongside george floyd’s family. he launched the national law enforcement accountability database with information on misconduct by federal law enforcement officers, and sharply restricted chokeholds and no-knock warrants for federal law enforcement. and, the administration is publishing data on the use of force and is also preventing certain militarized equipment from being sold or transferred to local police agencies. trump oversaw the largest one-year increase in murders ever recorded. on january , he encouraged the rioters who attacked the police officers protecting our capitol; since then, he has promised to pardon these convicted criminals. he is the candidate who wants to defund the police: as president, he repeatedly proposed cutting funding to state and local law enforcement programs, including the cops program that funds local police officers, for three years in a row. he has called to defund the department of justice and the fbi. and, he says he will withhold federal funding from local police departments that don’t adopt policies like stop-and-frisk or assist in mass deportations. trump has been equally disastrous for accountable policing. as president, he reversed restrictions that limited the transfer of surplus military equipment to local police departments and effectively abandoned pattern-or-practice investigations into police misconduct. when protests followed george floyd’s murder, he tweeted, “when the looting starts, the shooting starts” and referred to protesters as “thugs,” and tear-gassed nonviolent protesters outside the white house. if he gets another term, he will resume stop-and-frisk practices and withhold federal funding from local police departments that do not adopt this discriminatory policy. he’s promising to sign legislation to broaden qualified immunity to prevent legal accountability for police misconduct. president biden is committed to making our country safer for every american, civilians and law enforcement alike. democrats will pass his safer america plan, which calls on congress to invest $ billion to support law enforcement and crime prevention. that includes funding , additional police officers for accountable community policing and $ billion in community violence intervention , which will help prevent crime, keep communities safe, and build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. we will create a new violent crime reduction and prevention fund to give federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement the resources they need to fight crime, including to hire more agents, prosecutors, and forensic specialists. we will give communities the tools to crack down on gun crime, retail crime, and carjacking. democrats will build on the progress in president biden’s executive order on effective, accountable policing by passing the george floyd justice in policing act. and, we will end racial profiling and religious discrimination in law enforcement. criminal justice president biden is committed to rehabilitation and reentry for people returning to their communities after incarceration, and to building a criminal justice system that lives up to those ideals and ensures that everyone receives equal justice under law. that’s why he’s taken historic steps to make this promise a reality. no one should be in jail just for using or possessing marijuana. sending people to prison for possession has upended too many lives and incarcerated people for conduct that many states no longer prohibit. those criminal records impose needless barriers to employment, housing, and educational opportunities, disproportionately affecting black and brown people. president biden took historic action to end this failed approach by pardoning people convicted federally for using or possessing marijuana. he has called on governors to use their pardon power to do the same for state-level offenses. and his administration is taking a major step to reschedule cannabis so it's no longer classified as more dangerous than fentanyl or methamphetamine. president biden has released a comprehensive strategic plan to improve the criminal justice system and strengthen public safety, including more than concrete actions. the administration is improving rehabilitation in jails and prisons and helping people rebuild their lives, an important step in reducing recidivism. it has invested nearly $ billion in job training, addiction recovery, and reentry services across the country; and expanded access to pell grants, so people can earn a college degree while they are incarcerated, starting over with new skills. the administration will keep investing in housing, mentorship, job training, and apprenticeship programs as well. it is working to end the school-to-prison pipeline by reissuing guidance from the departments of education and justice to prevent disparate discipline of children of color and with disabilities and incentivizing states to develop community-based alternatives to prison for young people. and, president biden reestablished the justice department’s standalone office for access to justice to ensure that everyone can get legal assistance. president biden has used his pardon power to right historical wrongs. in addition to pardoning simple possession and use of marijuana, he’s pardoned or shortened the sentences of people convicted of other nonviolent drug offenses and pardoned approximately , gay, lesbian, and bisexual veterans who were convicted years ago just for being themselves. democrats will take action to expunge federal marijuana-only convictions. we will combat drug trafficking and expand the use of drug courts, interventions, and diversion for people with substance use disorders. we will fund a new accelerating justice system reform grant program to provide jurisdictions with critical resources to foster community trust and safety, reduce inequity and justice system involvement, and alleviate burdens on police. we will expand access to public defenders and step up civil rights enforcement, including by boosting funding for the justice department’s civil rights division and hiring new assistant u.s. attorneys. and, we will remove barriers to legal access, combat hate crimes, and counter cyber threats. to keep children and teens safe and out of the justice system, we will invest in after-school programs, community centers, and summer jobs. and, to ensure young people get a second chance after leaving the justice system, we will automatically seal and expunge juvenile records. democrats will end state-level use of private prisons and detention centers, and we will restrict state and local practices like solitary confinement, chokeholds, and restraints on pregnant inmates. we will guarantee access to medical care in prison and will eliminate profiteering from diversion, bail, electronic monitoring, commissaries, and reentry programs. we will support rehabilitation and education, including college programs, for inmates in prison and after their release. to help returning citizens succeed upon their release, we will boost access to transitional housing, affordable housing, mental health and substance use treatment. we will limit reincarcerating people federally to only serious violations of supervised release. and, we will work to expand “ban the box” so returning citizens can more easily find work, protect their right to vote, and protect their right to public services like pell grants and nutrition assistance. trump’s approach to criminal justice could not be more different. his administration threatened federal prosecution for marijuana cases in states where marijuana was legal. as president, trump granted fewer clemency requests than nearly every president since the start of the 20th century; and many of his grants were reserved for well-connected offenders and close friends and associates like steve bannon, roger stone, paul manafort, michael flynn, and charles kushner. hisadministration cut support for halfway houses and decreased the number of federal prisoners sent to transitional housing. and, it reinstated contracts with private prisons. violence against women ending violence against women has been the cause of president biden’s life. in the u.s. senate, with the help of courageous and committed advocates, he wrote the original violence against women act and spent the following decades working to expand and improve it with each reauthorization. as president, he was proud not only to reauthorize this landmark law but also to strengthen it. democrats secured the highest-ever funding level for vawa implementation, and are distributing record funding for local prosecutors, law enforcement, and survivor advocates. crucially, the administration has also expanded support for native survivors and strengthened protections for tribal communities; improved prevention and services for survivors of sexual assault, including through the fairness for rape kit backlog survivors act; expanded housing protections for domestic violence survivors; and increased services and support for survivors, including survivors of technology-facilitated abuse. president biden launched the first-ever national plan to end gender-based violence, and the american rescue plan provided immediate crisis intervention, health supports, and emergency services for survivors. he expanded funding for campus sexual assault prevention and is keeping students safe on campus by restoring and strengthening protections under title ix, including explicit protections for lgbtqi+ students. he signed legislation that narrowed the “boyfriend loophole” to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. he signed into law new protections to support survivors and address sexual assault and sexual harassment in the workplace. and, he signed a historic executive order on sexual assault and domestic violence in the military, transferring key decision-making authority from commanders to independent military prosecutors – the most significant transformation of the military justice system since the uniform code of military justice was established in . trump has made it abundantly clear that he doesn’t care about ending violence against women. as president, he failed to reauthorize vawa. and, his administration rolled back campus sexual assault protections, making it even harder for survivors to get the justice they deserve. democrats will work to end sexual assault, domestic violence, online abuse, and all violence against women. we continue to strengthen vawa; keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers; and expand housing and legal services for survivors. to keep students safe on campus, we will work with schools to implement and enforce title ix and end sexual harassment and assault in our nation’s schools. we will eliminate the rape kit backlog. and, we will strengthen legal protections for and support survivors of deepfake image-based sexual abuse building on the federal civil cause of action established under the president’s reauthorization of vawa in . chapter six: strengthening democracy, protecting freedoms, & advancing equity president biden, vice president harris, and democrats know that democracy has always been america’s sacred cause. whether that’s still true is the most urgent question of our time, and it’s what the election is all about. america is the only country on earth built on an idea: that all people are created equal. we’ve never fully lived up to that, but we’ve never walked away from it, either. and we won’t let donald trump and maga republicans walk away from it now. the president, vice president, and all democrats will continue to work every day to ensure that our democracy endures. president biden has put protecting american democracy at the heart of his presidency. when he took office, the nation was reeling from what it had just witnessed on january : a violent mob storming the capitol, smashing windows, kicking in doors, attacking scores of police officers, and roaming the corridors hunting for elected officials – all whipped into a frenzy by trump’s lies, repeated over and over for months, to overturn the will of the people. president biden spent his first term working to restore trust in our institutions, protect our freedoms, and preserve our democracy for the future. president biden, vice president harris, and democrats have consistently made it clear that political violence has no place in america. trump refuses to defend core tenets of our democracy: the constitution, the rule of law, our system of checks and balances. he still doesn’t accept the plain truth, upheld by scores of courts, that he lost in , even describing himself as a “very proud election denier” – and he has never agreed to accept this year’s results. after years undermining public faith and confidence in our elections, he has warned of a “bloodbath” if he loses now. he lionizes the convicted criminals who perpetrated the january attack on our capitol and brave police, calling those insurrectionists “patriots” and “hostages” while promising to pardon them. we know how trump will weaken our democracy if he gets another term. he has promised to be a dictator on “day one” – and we’ve already seen how he fawns over other dictators. he has vowed to weaponize our government to go after his enemies and benefit his allies. he has plans to fire dedicated, nonpolitical civil servants and replace them with loyalists who will do his bidding; and he has promised to exert presidential authority over what have long been independent agencies. and to silence his critics, he suggested the “termination” of our constitution. the stakes in this election for the soul of our nation are profound. this election will decide whether the next generation of americans has more rights and freedoms than past generations, or fewer. trump and republicans are already ripping away americans’ hard-won freedoms. reproductive freedom, freedom from hate, freedom from fear, the freedom to control our own destinies and more are all on the line in this election. democrats will not let that happen. together, we will continue uniting and rallying americans across the political spectrum in defense of our democracy, and making it clear that political violence has no place in america. we will defend our freedoms, restore essential trust in our institutions, and preserve america’s vital role as a beacon of democracy across the world. judges one of a president’s most important duties is appointing the judges who shape our country’s laws. judges matter. they have the power to uphold basic rights or to roll them back. they hear cases that decide whether women have the freedom to make their own reproductive health care decisions; whether americans have the freedom to cast their ballots; whether workers have the freedom to unionize and make a living wage for their families; whether children have the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water; and whether a president is above the law. judicial appointments are crucial at every level of the federal bench, but nowhere more so than on the supreme court. the next president could appoint one, two, or more new supreme court justices. those justices will determine what freedoms americans have – or lose – for the next , , or even years. the choice is clear. president biden appointed justice ketanji brown jackson, the first black woman ever named to the supreme court, who has stood up for americans’ rights and freedoms throughout her career on the bench. trump handpicked three justices who have pushed a far-right agenda with devastating consequences. the court’s attack on a wide range of long-established american legal principles – from overturning roe and eliminating the right to choose, to weakening voting rights and civil rights, to granting immunity for presidential crimes – in fact undermines the rule of law. if he’s elected again, trump will appoint more justices in the same mold; his past supreme court short lists have always been stocked with far-right ideologues. trump made clear in his first term that his goal was to appoint as many far-right judges as he could, regardless of their qualifications – even appointing to lifetime seats a series of candidates deemed “not qualified” by the american bar association. while president biden has sought to appoint judges who look like america, three-quarters of trump’s judicial appointees were men and percent were white. if trump keeps stacking the court with extreme conservatives, the far right will have final say over our laws for decades to come, wreaking even more havoc on our system of checks and balances and the consequences for our country will be devastating. president biden will continue to appoint justices and judges across the federal bench who are like justice jackson: brilliant jurists committed to defending american rights and freedoms. judges should reflect the diverse population whose laws they shape, and president biden has appointed more than highly qualified federal judges who look like america. nearly two-thirds of the judges he’s appointed have been women, and nearly two-thirds have been people of color. president biden has appointed more black women to federal circuit courts than every other president combined; more latino judges have been confirmed to circuit courts than under any other president; more aanhpi judges have been confirmed than in any other administration; and after only one term, he is already tied for the most openly lgbtqi+ judges appointed. president biden has also chosen judges from diverse professional backgrounds, ensuring a range of perspectives and experiences are represented on the federal bench: at least of his judicial appointees are former public defenders, at least have served as civil rights lawyers, and at least nine have represented workers. in president biden’s second term, he will continue selecting judges who will protect fundamental rights and who represent the diversity of the american experience. we will push for a supreme court that follows the rule of law, protects people's freedoms, and abides by the highest ethical standards. voting rights the right to vote and to have your vote counted is the threshold of american democracy and liberty. without it, nothing is possible; with it, anything is. decades after a generation of civil rights leaders faced fire hoses and batons, were brutally beaten and even died to secure this fundamental right, it remains under assault. since their first days in office, president biden and vice president harris have taken action to protect the sacred right to vote in free, fair, and secure elections, especially for communities of color who have been historically disenfranchised. within the first days of his presidency, president biden signed an executive order directing an all-of-government effort to promote access to voting. agencies have taken historic action to help veterans, college students, native americans, and other underserved communities register to vote. because laws are only as effective as their enforcement, the department of justice has more than doubled its staff dedicated to enforcing voting rights laws. and because the american people deserve to have faith in their elections, president biden signed the electoral count reform act to preserve the will of the people and to protect against the type of attempts to overturn our elections that led to the january insurrection. trump has a dark and different view, with a long history of supporting rollbacks to voting rights. he has spent years undermining the electoral process and confidence in elections, and continues to spread blatant lies about the election he lost. trump’s allies in state legislatures across the country have enacted and continue to introduce laws that make it harder to vote and undermine the will of the people. trump supported georgia’s voter suppression law, which makes it illegal to hand out water to voters waiting in line. if he returns to the white house, he will seek to eliminate early voting and mail ballots to make it harder for americans to exercise their right to vote. key to the right to vote is ensuring that voters pick their elected officials – not the other way around. president biden has spoken out against extreme gerrymandering and harmful court decisions that perpetuate it, and he has consistently advocated for legislation that would end it and create fair congressional maps. meanwhile, trump opposes efforts to draw fairer maps. congress must restore the protections of the voting rights act and take additional steps to ensure access to the ballot box. democrats will pass and president biden will sign the john r. lewis voting rights advancement act and the freedom to vote act to fully secure the right to vote in every state, ensure fair congressional maps for every american, modernize and secure our elections, and curtail the corrupting influence of money in politics. stopping the influence of special interests too much money flows in the shadows to influence our elections. advocacy groups can run ads on issues attacking or supporting a candidate right until election day without disclosing who’s paying for that ad. too often, powerful special interests use front groups to run these ads to win at any cost. even foreign entities that aren’t allowed to contribute to political campaigns use dark money loopholes to try to influence our elections. to fight back, president biden has called for immediate passage of the disclose act, which will require advocacy groups that run ads to influence elections to disclose donors who contribute more than $,, and ban foreign entities from contributing to them. under president biden’s leadership, the fec has also finalized a rule expanding political advertising disclaimer requirements for online public communications. democrats will also fight to strengthen public financing with small-dollar matching for all federal candidates and crack down on foreign nationals who try to influence elections. we will keep super pacs wholly independent of campaigns and parties and pass a constitutional amendment that will ban all private financing from federal elections. democrats will end “dark money” by requiring full disclosure of contributors and ban (c)() organizations from spending on elections. and, to curb the influence of special interests in our elections, democrats will prohibit corporate pacs and lobbyists from donating to anyone they lobby. trust in democracy is critical to protecting democracy. democrats will adopt ethics reforms to ensure every american can feel confident that their government is working for them, not for special interests. democrats will enact legislation to apply similar standards to members of congress. democrats will create a federal ethics commission to strengthen good governance laws, like those requiring financial and lobbying disclosure. democrats will require all federal candidates to disclose at least years of tax returns. to ensure tax dollars go to work for the american people, not for special interests, democrats will reestablish merit-based federal contracting and ban political appointees from interfering in grantmaking. and to ensure that policy decisions are guided by what’s best for the american people, not by special interests, democrats will strengthen laws that regulate lobbying by foreign governments and lower the threshold for registering as a federal lobbyist. reproductive freedom trump’s supreme court appointees overturned roe v wade, eliminating a fundamental constitutional right and denying women across the nation the right to choose. the extreme act of overturning roe , which had been the law of the land for nearly half a century, has already had devastating consequences nationwide. over the past two years, more than states have imposed extreme and dangerous abortion bans – many of which include no exception even for rape or incest – that put the health and lives of women in jeopardy, force women to travel hundreds of miles for care, and threaten to criminalize doctors for providing the health care that their patients need and that they are trained to provide. laws that limit access to contraception and to fertility treatments like ivf. laws that were first adopted in the 1800s. more than one in three women of reproductive age, and more than half of black women and percent of latinas, now live under an abortion ban. today, our daughters have fewer rights than their grandmothers. president biden, vice president harris, and democrats are fighting back to restore reproductive freedom for every woman in every state. president biden signed three executive orders and a presidential memorandum to stand up for reproductive rights. the administration is protecting access to abortion, including by creating a new path for pharmacies to dispense fda-approved medication abortion and defending access in court. it is expanding reproductive health care for service members, veterans, and their family members. the administration is defending access to emergency medical care, including clarifying that federal law on emergency care preempts state abortion bans, educating patients on their rights, making it easier for patients who have been denied emergency care to file a complaint, and ensuring hospitals meet their legal obligations to offer care. it is challenging threats from republicans to prosecute people who help women travel to a different state for abortion care, and helping states expand access under medicaid for women who travel from states with bans. we are safeguarding patients’ and providers’ privacy, including by strengthening hipaa protections, cracking down on the illegal sharing of personal information, strengthening consumer data protections, and issuing guidance to protect student privacy in this area. and we are ensuring access to accurate information and legal resources, including by launching reproductiverights.gov and convening more than lawyers and advocates to support abortion-related legal defense services. the contrast between president biden and trump is stark. trump handpicked supreme court justices he knew would overturn roe, saying it would be overturned “automatically.” he’s said that he’s “proudly the person responsible” for overturning roe, and he continues to brag about it. trump is responsible for the more than twenty state bans that are now in effect as a result. he has said women should be punished for getting an abortion, and that states should be able to punish doctors who provide them. if he returns to the white house, trump will ban abortion nationwide. and his allies plan to ban medication abortion nationwide, without congress or the courts, by enforcing a law from the 1800s, including prosecuting women and doctors for sending or receiving medication abortion in the mail. nine in women have used contraception, and democrats are also working to expand access to birth control. under president biden’s leadership, the fda approved the first over-the-counter daily oral contraceptive, making birth control easier than ever to access. president biden has also built on the affordable care act to make a broader range of contraceptives available to women at no cost through their health insurance. the administration has boosted access to free and low-cost services through the title x family planning program, and expanded access to birth control for service members and through theva. trump’s record on contraception could not be more different. trump undermined access to contraception as president, decreasing access for millions by sabotaging the title x family planning grant program and weakening the aca’s coverage mandate. his allies have published plans to further attack access to contraception through executive action, including by further undermining women’s insurance coverage for birth control and reducing access to condoms and emergency contraception. the supreme court’s elimination of the protections of roe has also had devastating consequences for families who have suffered the heartbreak of infertility. each year, tens of thousands of americans start or grow their families with the help of in vitro fertilization. ivf is enormously popular, enjoying the support of the vast majority of americans. yet trump’s overturning roe opened the door to laws that rip away access to this vital care – as we saw when alabama families had treatments halted earlier this year. president biden has responded to attacks on reproductive care by expanding ivf access for service members, veterans, and federal employees. meanwhile, trump has refused to commit to vetoing the life at conception act, a national abortion ban that threatens ivf access nationwide, and his allies are openly attacking ivf. president biden, vice president harris, and democrats are committed to restoring the reproductive rights trump ripped away. with a democratic congress, we will pass national legislation to make roe the law of the land again. we will strengthen access to contraception so every woman who needs it is able to get and afford it. we will protect a woman’s right to access ivf. we will repeal the hyde amendment. and in his second term, president biden will continue to support access to fda-approved medication abortion, appoint leaders at the fda who respect science, and appoint judges who uphold fundamental freedoms. women’s rights despite the progress we’ve made since our nation’s founding, there is more work ahead to knock down the barriers that stand in the way of women and girls realizing their full potential. in a country founded on freedom and equality, nothing is more fundamental. no one should be discriminated against based on their sex; and we, as a nation, must affirm and protect women’s full equality. democrats will fight to make the equal rights amendment the law of the land. when women thrive in the workplace, our economy is strong. under president biden’s leadership, more women are in the workforce than ever, matching the lowest annual women’s unemployment rate since , with the narrowest gender pay gap on record. democrats passed and president biden signed the pregnant workers fairness act to protect women’s rights on the job, ensuring that pregnant and postpartum workers have the basic, long overdue protections they need to stay in the workforce while pregnant and as new mothers. democrats also passed the pump act, so more nursing mothers have access to break time and a private place to pump. to promote pay equity and curb pay discrimination, the administration ended the use of salary history in pay-setting decisions for federal workers and will expand this protection to most contractors. as the president’s economic agenda creates millions of jobs, he is making sure that women benefit, including through his million women in construction initiative, registered apprenticeship programs, and the good jobs initiative. he has also expanded opportunities for women entrepreneurs, increasing sba loans to women-owned businesses by percent, and awarding more federal contracting dollars to women-owned small businesses than ever. and because affordable child care is critical to expanding opportunities for parents, especially women, president biden helped hundreds of thousands of child care providers keep their doors open to millions of children and saved families thousands of dollars on child care costs. the president also signed into law new protections to support survivors and address sexual assault and sexual harassment in the workplace. while president biden has worked to support women in the workplace, trump weakened protections for them. he moved to block an obama-era rule that required companies to report pay by race and gender, an important tool in the fight for pay equity. he also limited the salary threshold increase under which salaried workers were eligible for overtime, leaving behind millions of workers who would have benefited under the original rule. there is more work to do. democrats will work to pass the paycheck fairness act and end pay inequity not just in the federal workforce, but throughout the economy with penalties for companies that discriminate against women. and, we will guarantee affordable, high-quality child care from birth until kindergarten, with most families paying just $ a day — and make it free for low-income families. we will protect the health and dignity of older adults and people with disabilities by improving long-term care and supporting family caregivers, and we will invest in care infrastructure by raising wages and the quality of care worker jobs. we will establish a national, comprehensive paid family and medical leave program to ensure that all workers, including women, can take the time they need to bond with a new child, care for a loved one, or recover from an illness. we are also closing fundamental gaps in women’s health care and addressing the maternal health crisis. women in america are dying at a higher rate from pregnancy-related causes than women in any other wealthy nation, especially black and native women. vice president harris came into office as a key leader on maternal health and continues to lead the fight for improved maternal health outcomes, elevating the issue nationally and convening experts and activists to find solutions. the american rescue plan gave states the option to provide a full year of postpartum coverage to women on medicaid, increasing it from just days. vice president harris challenged all states to provide a full year of coverage; and states, the district of columbia, and the u.s. virgin islands now do. the administration also expanded access to maternity care coordinators for u.s. military veterans, from eight weeks to months postpartum. and, it established the first-ever national maternal health and safety standards for hospitals across the country, which include requirements that hospitals have resuscitation equipment in labor and delivery rooms and proper protocols and supplies for emergency deliveries. the administration released a blueprint outlining other federal actions to combat maternal mortality and improve maternal health. and it launched the national maternal mental health hotline which has helped tens of thousands of women. for too long, women haven’t been able to get the answers they need when it comes to their health—from cardiovascular disease to autoimmune diseases to menopause-related conditions. to pioneer the next generation of medical discoveries, the president and the first lady launched the first-ever white house initiative on women’s health research, which aims to fundamentally change how we approach and fund women’s health research in the united states. it includes a $ million commitment to fund the arpa-h sprint for women’s health, a $ million national institutes of health-wide effort to catalyze interdisciplinary research, and more than other new actions and commitments to advance women’s health research and especially research on menopause-related conditions and women’s midlife health. and president biden signed an executive order to direct the most comprehensive set of executive actions ever taken to expand and improve research on women’s health. democrats will continue working to address the maternal health crisis and ensure every american has access to high-quality, culturally competent care before, during, and after pregnancy. and we will continue to invest in women’s health research to galvanize new research and breakthroughs on a wide range of topics. trump will reverse our progress. he will repeal the affordable care act, putting coverage of prenatal, pregnancy, and postpartum care at risk. and he has attacked medicaid, which covers percent of births to black mothers and percent of births to latino mothers. racial equity since day one, the administration has championed an ambitious equity and racial justice agenda to ensure the full and fair participation of all communities in our economy and democracy, and to ensure the promise of america for everyone, including black, latino, and asian american, native hawaiian, and pacific islander (aanhpi) americans. democrats are building a strong economy from the bottom up and the middle out. black and latino unemployment has hit record lows under president biden, and the aanhpi employment rate is at its highest since . wages are rising faster than prices, and the greatest gains have gone to the low-paid workers. the ideal of equal opportunity is the bedrock of american democracy, but our laws, public policies, and institutions too often exacerbate disparities or deny equal opportunity to individuals and communities. president biden signed two executive orders to change that, including by increasing access to federal contracting dollars, capital, and lending programs for small disadvantaged businesses; reducing discrimination in the housing market; protecting overburdened communities from environmental harms; addressing historic disinvestment and infrastructure neglect; addressing health and health care disparities; rooting out educational inequities and preserving pathways to equal opportunity; tackling persistent poverty and building economic prosperity in rural communities; promoting equity and fairness in the justice system; combating bias, discrimination and hate-based violence; and bolstering proactive enforcement that protects the civil rights of all americans. democrats expanded the child tax credit to millions more families, slashing the child poverty rate in half to record lows, including for black, latino, and aanhpi children. we’ll keep fighting to make that expansion permanent. the administration has also expanded food assistance to those in need, providing the typical low-income family of four about $, more for groceries each year by improving snap; and it launched a summer food benefits program that serves nearly million children. democrats will keep working to increase food security, including through wic and summer ebt, and by bringing back the enhanced child tax credit. starting a business is part of the american dream, and democrats are working to make that possible for everyone, boosting access to capital and loans, and to business through government contracting work. today, black americans are starting new businesses at the fastest rate in years; and latinos at the fastest rate in over a decade. since the pandemic, the share of black households owning a business has more than doubled, latino business ownership is up percent, and women own a record share of businesses. the administration set a goal that percent of federal contracts go to small disadvantaged businesses (sdbs) and will continue expanding these opportunities for sdbs in a second term. the small business administration (sba) has doubled the number and dollar value of loans awarded to black-owned businesses, and doubled the rate of sba-backed loans to latino-owned small businesses. we eliminated the ban on sba lending to people on probation or parole, and banned “the box” on sba loan forms, so that people are no longer asked about their past records when applying for a loan. and, the minority business development agency, now a permanent part of the commerce department, is opening new offices and building partnerships with hbcus, in its work to help minority-owned businesses across the country to overcome barriers and grow. the administration has also increased investment in community development financial institutions (cdfis) and minority depository institutions (mdis), and issued new licenses for nonbank lenders, helping more people in underserved communities to get capital and start businesses. as part of this work, vice president harris launched the economic opportunity coalition bringing together major corporations and foundations to align public and private sector investments with a particular focus on driving private investment in cdfis and mdis. by investing in community lenders, we’re driving an estimated $ billion more in loans to black and latino communities over the next decade. going forward, we’ll double that funding for cdfis, and expand and make permanent a new markets tax credit, to encourage development in places too long left behind. the american rescue plan also provided $ billion of debt forgiveness for black and other “socially disadvantaged” farmers, a group that has endured decades of discrimination from banks and the federal government. trump’s maga allies brought lawsuits, and his judicial appointees blocked that funding, but democrats kept pushing. they secured over $ billion in the inflation reduction act to provide financial assistance to farmers, ranchers and forest landowners who've faced discrimination; and to cover loan payments for farmers in financial distress. over $ billion has already been distributed to more than , people. the agriculture department estimates that black and underserved farmers have benefited most. the robust economic recovery that president biden is leading is also working to close the persistent racial wealth gap that has plagued our country for generations. today, black wealth has climbed percent since before the pandemic; latino homeownership is higher than before the pandemic, and median latino household wealth is up percent in the last three years. homeownership is one of the most important ways that families can build wealth. the administration launched a first-of-its-kind task force to end pernicious bias in the home appraisal process, which has for too long undervalued black- and latino-owned homes. since then, the likelihood that a home in a black community is undervalued compared to a home in a white community has been cut by more than percent. democrats are working to bring down housing costs across the board. the american rescue plan kept million families in their homes throughout the pandemic ; and the president has since introduced the most ambitious housing agenda in years, with plans to boost supply, lower rent, and make homeownership more affordable. it includes down payment assistance for first-generation homeowners and a mortgage relief tax credit for first-time homebuyers, which will disproportionately benefit communities of color. we are also working to connect communities that have been isolated from opportunity for too long. highways and rail lines have disproportionately torn through black, latino,and low-income areas; displacing and segregating residents and businesses; stifling economic growth and investment; and cutting people off from groceries, jobs, and health care. through the bipartisan infrastructure law, we are righting those historic wrongs by investing in new roads, bridges, railways, and public transit and more, we know that no child’s future should be determined by their parents’ income or zip code. we’ve made historic investments in education in the last four years, boosting funding for title i and community schools, investing in thousands of new school counselors and mental health providers, and supporting efforts to boost attendance and expand tutoring and summer programs. we passed the most significant gun safety law in years, an important first step toward protecting all our children from the scourge of gun violence. we’re supporting students with disabilities, and working to end physical restraint and prevent discrimination, bullying, and harassment. and, where maga extremists are politicizing our classrooms, banning books, and trying to erase history, we are fighting back, including by appointing a federal coordinator to address the threat these bans pose to students’ civil rights. we’re also investing in recruiting and training teachers from all communities, including in partnership with hbcus, msis, and tcus; and helping them to get the pay that they deserve. it matters to children when they see someone who looks like them at the front of a classroom. democrats are also working to make college more affordable, and to relieve the crippling burden of student debt, which disproportionately falls on students of color. black students take on percent more debt than white peers, and both black and latino borrowers are more likely to hold debt many years longer after graduation, deferring their dreams to buy a home, build a family, or start a business. that’s why the president’s action to cancel $ billion in student loans for nearly five million americans, and to ease repayment for millions of others is such an important step in leveling the playing field for everyone. to help more low-income students afford college in the first place, the administration has also increased the maximum pell grant by $, and will double it in the future. we’re expanding access to free community college; providing subsidized tuition for children from families earning less than $, a year who attend hbcus, tcus, hispanic- and minority serving institutions. the administration has made historic investments in those schools, as well as in registered apprenticeships, to train americans everywhere for the careers of the future. democrats are also committed to ending generations of environmental injustices that have left communities of color bearing the brunt of toxic pollution and climate change, decaying infrastructure, and inadequate services. the administration is delivering on its justice40 initiative to deliver percent of the overall benefits of our investments in infrastructure, clean energy and manufacturing investments to disadvantaged communities. today, we’re replacing every toxic lead pipe in the country, accelerating superfund cleanups, cracking down on polluters that have poisoned their neighborhoods air, water, and soil for too long. we’re making sure that every community benefits from home energy tax credits, low-cost solar panels, and other programs that can save families money while reducing emissions. and we’re investing in climate-resilient infrastructure that will protect every part of this country from extreme weather and other consequences of climate change. democrats will also keep fighting to address disparities in health care and make sure every american has access to quality, affordable health care. we’ve continued to protect and expand the affordable care act, expanding coverage to more americans ever in history; and we’re taking historic steps to lower the cost of prescription drugs — like capping insulin at $ a month and prescription drug costs at $, a year for seniors — and we’ll keep fighting to expand those caps for every american. we will keep pushing to provide medicaid-like coverage to people in states that have not expanded medicaid, and to make it easier for parents to keep children enrolled in medicaid and chip. we’ll defend all women’s right to reproductive health care. as highlighted above, we’re tackling the crisis of maternal mortality, expanding medicaid to cover women for a full year postpartum and investing in a diverse workforce to support pregnant and postpartum women. and, we will address the disproportionate impact of infectious diseases, including hiv and hepatitis c, and expand access to prep to end the hiv epidemic. we have a long way to go to realize the full promise of america, but we are committed as a party to continuing the work to build a nation where all people are not only created equal, but treated equally throughout their lives. to determine how best to right historical wrongs, democrats support congress executing a study of reparations and the continuing impacts of slavery. trump’s vision for america is very different. as president, he shortchanged black-owned businesses when it was time to hand out covid relief funds. his tax law benefitted wealthy white americans over everyone else. unemployment rates soared during his presidency for people of color, while he tried to cut health care, affordable housing, and social security. as a real estate developer, he was sued for race-based housing discrimination and systemic violations of the fair housing act, engaging in long standing racial segregation and discrimination in properties they owned and operated. now, he wants to repeal the affordable care act, ripping health care away from millions. he will gut president biden’s landmark jobs, prescription drug, and climate bills, and put a crippling import tax on the everyday things people need to get by, raising costs for black and latino families on everything from insulin to internet to school supplies. he will increase the racial wealth gap, by cutting taxes for billionaires and big corporations while sticking working families with the bill. he will make our communities less safe: the murder rate spiked by a record during his presidency; crime is near a year low under president biden. trump and his hand-picked courts will continue their attacks on our rights and freedoms, eroding voting rights, the freedom to protest, and freedom to make one’s own healthcare decisions. america cannot afford to go back. lgbtqi+ for generations, lgbtqi+ americans have summoned the courage to live authentically and proudly, even when it meant putting their lives and livelihoods at risk. lgbtqi+ americans continue to inspire and bring hope to all people seeking a life true to who they are, and to enrich every aspect of american life. but the fight for equality is far from over, as the lgbtqi+ community continues to face attacks and bigotry in states across the country. democrats are committed to defending lgbtqi+ rights. president biden is committed to leading the most pro-equality administration in history. democrats passed and president biden signed the historic respect for marriage act, enshrining marriage equality in federal law. he reversed trump’s un-american ban on transgender servicemembers and ended the disgraceful and discriminatory ban on blood donation by gay and bisexual men. on day one of his presidency, he signed a historic executive order extending federal nondiscrimination protections to lgbtqi+ people, and he signed executive orders strengthening civil rights protections in housing, employment, health care, education, and the justice system. he pardoned service members who had been discharged for being themselves. as president, trump rolled back the lgbtqi+ community’s hard-fought progress. trump gutted obama–biden anti-discrimination protections for lgbtqi+ americans and banned transgender service members from serving, overruling the recommendations of military leaders and public health professionals. and, he appointed judges who oppose same-sex marriage, have sided with businesses to reject lgbtqi+ customers, and helped implement the military’s transgender ban. when a person can be married in the morning and thrown out of a restaurant for being gay in the afternoon, something is still wrong. that’s why democrats will pass the equality act to codify protections for lgbtqi+ americans and their families. we will prohibit employment discrimination in the federal government, including contractors, and make federally-funded seniors programs lgbtqi+ inclusive. and we have and will continue to make great strides in protecting lgbtqi+ children and prospective parents in the adoption and foster care systems. president biden has delivered on his promise to ban discrimination in health care on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation. he has protected transgender americans’ access to health care and coverage, including medically necessary gender-affirming care; and implemented a national strategy to end the hiv epidemic in this country. democrats will build on this progress to expand mental health and suicide prevention services for lgbtqi+ people. trump wants to repeal the affordable care act, which will increase costs and rip away protections for lgbtqi+ americans. that landmark law ensures lgbtqi+ people nationwide can access health care free from discrimination; helped reduce the uninsured rate among lgbtqi+ americans and their family members; and banned insurance companies from denying care or charging more for people with pre-existing conditions. trump’s maga republican allies are also looking to target surrogacy for lgbtqi+ americans next. as president biden has said, lgbtqi+ youth are some of the bravest people he knows, and he has made it a priority to fight for them. the administration is combating the dangerous and cruel practice of so-called “conversion therapy.” democrats have invested in supporting lgbtqi+ youth mental health, including through the historic bipartisan safer communities act. president biden has also taken action to support lgbtqi+ youth in foster care; and is fighting book bans that censor lgbtqi+ content. he signed an executive order recommitting the federal government to guarantee educational environments free from sex discrimination, including on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. he signed a historic executive order to address discriminatory legislative attacks against lgbtqi+ children and families, directing key agencies to protect families and children; safeguard health care and programs designed to prevent youth suicide; and support lgbtqi+ children and families by launching a new initiative to protect foster youth, prevent homelessness, and improve access to federal programs. and, he established the white house task force to address online harassment and abuse to help fight online hate that disproportionately targets lgbtqi+ people, including youth. trump is running on an extreme plan to punish doctors who treat transgender youth and to ban gender-affirming care, and his maga republican allies have pushed a tidal wave of extreme anti-lgbtqi+ bills in statehouses across the country. democrats will vigorously oppose state and federal bans on gender-affirming health care and respect the role of parents, families, and doctors – not politicians – in making health care decisions. democrats will continue to fight for lgbtqi+ youth by building on president biden’s historic actions to ban so-called “conversion therapy”; protecting lgbtqi+ children from bullying and discrimination; guaranteeing that transgender students are treated fairly and with respect at school; and ending the homeless crisis among lgbtqi+ youth. lgbtqi+ americans have long faced threats to their safety just for being who they are. president biden launched the lgbtqi+ community safety partnership to provide community safety trainings, support health care providers who serve the lgbtqi+ community, and support lgbtqi+ communities to report hate crimes, and build cross-community partnerships to address hate-fueled violence. the justice department is taking an all-of-department approach to protecting lgbtqi+ rights. democrats will end violence against transgender americans, especially black and brown transgender women, and prioritize the investigation of hate crimes against trans and non-binary people. disability people with disabilities have long strengthened our economy and expanded our nation’s possibilities. and, groundbreaking legislation like the americans with disabilities act and the rehabilitation act have made significant strides toward equal opportunity for people with disabilities. but there is more work to do. people with disabilities are three times less likely to have a job, and when they do, they are often paid less money for doing the same work. democrats are taking action to fix that. president biden signed an executive order establishing a government-wide commitment to advancing equality and equity in federal employment, including for people with disabilities. the labor department is protecting workers with disabilities and fighting to end unjust employment practices. the administration is helping state and local governments, businesses, and nonprofits access federal funds to hire more disabled americans. and president biden is making sure his administration looks like america, appointing people with disabilities to positions all across our government. he is making the federal government a model employer when it comes to wages, accommodations, and opportunities to advance for people with disabilities. and he’s helping young people with disabilities transition from education to employment through the disability innovation fund. president biden is also working to improve health care for people with disabilities. the administration released a rule barring providers from denying medical treatments related to organ donations or lifesaving care for disabled americans based on their disability alone. it launched long covid clinical trials and created the office of long covid research and practice. the national institutes of health designated people with disabilities a “health disparity population,” unlocking new resources for research. president biden also signed an executive order increasing access to quality care and supporting caregivers; as well as historic legislation that expands home- and community-based services under medicaid. accessible public spaces are essential to ensuring equal opportunity for people with disabilities. democrats have invested in accessible infrastructure, including rail station accessibility and actions to make airports and airplanes more accessible. and democrats passed and president biden signed the bipartisan infrastructure law, which expanded access to affordable broadband, an especially important step for people with disabilities. trump has a long record of discrimination against people with disabilities, including publicly mocking them. his business has faced a series of lawsuits for failing to comply with the ada. discrimination complaints from federal workers with disabilities employed at cabinet-level agencies increased percent while he was president, and in his first year in office, the number of people with disabilities fired by the government increased percent, with workers with disabilities fired at almost two times the rate of workers without disabilities. trump repeatedly proposed billions in cuts to social security disability insurance and called for restrictions on eligibility and benefit cutbacks. he called to cut funding for special education grants and eliminate federal funding for the special olympics. he has promised to close the department of education, threatening enforcement of idea protections for students with disabilities. and he rescinded guidance protecting students with disabilities, including guidance aimed at ensuring students with disabilities were not unfairly disciplined. democrats will enforce laws that ensure equal opportunity for people with disabilities: the ada, idea, the fair housing act, the civil rights of institutionalized persons act, section of the rehabilitation act, the mental health parity act, and the help america vote act. we oppose efforts to weaken the ada and build on the aca to prevent health care discrimination. democrats will enforce the olmstead integration mandate and enforce non-discrimination protections in health care, employment, education, housing, voting. we will promote equitable treatment of students with disabilities so every child with disabilities can thrive. and to support people with disabilities and their families, we will support home and community-based care and end the subminimum wage. tribal nations president biden’s relationship with tribal nations and their citizens is built on respect for tribal sovereignty and self-governance, honoring federal trust and treaty responsibilities, protecting tribal homelands, and conducting regular, meaningful, and robust consultation with tribal nations. native communities pass down rich cultures, knowledge, traditions, and ways of life. but throughout our history, native peoples’ cultures, identities, and governments were not always seen as a part of this nation but as a threat to it, and they faced violence and devastation that cost countless lives, tore families apart, and caused lasting damage to tribal communities and institutions. despite centuries of violence and oppression, native peoples remain resilient and proud. today, native americans are essential to the fabric of the united states. since president biden took office, he has helped champion a new and better chapter in the story of our nation-to-nation relationships. he appointed the first native american secretary of the interior, deb haaland, and more than native americans hold senior administration roles. he also relaunched tribal nations summit and reestablished the white house council on native american affairs. he is protecting sacred and tribal lands, including by restoring protections for berryessa snow mountain, avi kwa ame, and bears ears and grand staircase-escalante national monuments. to further tribal self-governance and usher in a new era of self-determination, he signed a historic executive order that ensures the federal government respects the nation-to-nation relationship with tribes by ensuring maximal autonomy in funding and other steps. he has invested in supporting native families and communities: democrats passed and president biden signed the american rescue plan, which made the largest direct federal investment in tribal nations in history, along with additional historic funds in the bipartisan infrastructure law and the inflation reduction act. democrats expanded the child tax credit, pushing native child poverty to a record low in . we secured the first-ever advance appropriations for the indian health service. and president biden also defended the indian child welfare act and will continue doing so. for decades, native communities have been devastated by an epidemic of disappearances and killings, too often without resolution, justice, or accountability. president biden is taking action to address the missing and murdered indigenous persons crisis; the departments of justice and the interior working together to accelerate investigations, doi creating a unit to work on this issue, and fbi hiring personnel to focus on these cases. after trump failed to reauthorize the violence against women act, democrats finally did and included new protections and programs to support tribal survivors through the expansion of special criminal jurisdiction of tribal courts. the administration awarded $ million in grants to support native communities to provide services and promote justice for survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, stalking, and trafficking. his administration has continued to implement the not invisible act commission recommendations to address violent crime and the high rates of people reported missing in native communities and relaunched the north american trilateral working group on violence against indigenous women and girls. and the administration has issued final fee-to-trust land acquisitions rules and changes to native american graves protection and repatriation act regulations. trump’s presidency was a disaster for native communities. tribal communities were disproportionately harmed by trump’s disastrous response to the covid pandemic, seeing higher hospitalization rates than other demographics. he worked to sabotage the aca and will repeal it if he gets back to the white house. he tried to cut agencies and programs important to tribal communities, like job training and business development funding and from tribal scholarship and education programs. democrats will continue promoting nation-to-nation partnerships with tribal nations. we will continue strengthening and respect for tribal sovereignty, the federal trust responsibility, tribal treaty rights, and native history, including educating the federal workforce, providing best practices for sacred sites, and ensuring native american history is recognized. democrats will keep working to make federal resources for tribal nations more accessible and protect health, education, safety, and welfare in indian country, particularly for native women, children, and families. we will make ihs funding mandatory. we will invest in housing in tribal communities, and support tribal conservation through co-stewardship of public lands and waters. we will continue to usher in the next era of tribal self-determination. and democrats will invest in public safety and justice, including by increasing the number of officers and investigators on the ground; address the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous persons; and supporting vawa programs, including a new grant program to address the missing and murdered indigenous persons crisis. combating hate & protecting freedom of religion as president biden often says, certain core values bring us together as americans — and one of them is standing together against the hate, racism, bigotry, and violence that have long haunted our nation. we can and must come together regardless of our backgrounds. president biden and vice president harris have taken historic action to stand up to hate. president biden signed the emmett till anti-lynching act to finally make lynching a federal crime. he hosted the united we stand summit, elevating the fight against hate to the highest levels of our government. he signed covid- hate crimes act after aanhpi americans faced a wave of hate during the pandemic. he has sought increased funding to improve the prevention, reporting and prosecution of hate crimes. and democrats secured the greatest funding increase in history for bolstering the security of nonprofits, including houses of worship. president biden has been a strong and unequivocal voice speaking out against rising antisemitism in america. the administration released the first-ever national strategy to counter antisemitism, outlining a whole-of-society effort, including unprecedented, coordinated, and bold actions across government agencies, and calls to action for congress, state and local governments, companies, technology platforms, and others. as part of that strategy, the administration clarified, for the first time in writing, that title vi of the civil rights act of prohibits certain forms of antisemitic, islamophobic, and related discrimination, including discrimination by national origin, in federally funded programs and activities. president biden continues to take bold action to combat antisemitism on college campuses. and he has prioritized fighting antisemitism abroad by appointing deborah lipstadt as u.s. special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism, an ambassador-level position. president biden knows that islamophobia has no place in our society. across his administration, agencies are taking action to fight islamophobia and support muslim americans. his administration is developing the first-ever u.s. national strategy to counter islamophobia and related forms of bias and discrimination, including hate against arab, sikh and south asian americans. he is the first president in history to recognize the international day to combat islamophobia, and his administration released a dear colleague letter reminding schools, including institutions of higher learning, of their legal obligation under title vi to address discrimination, including harassment, based on race, color or national origin, including discrimination against students who are or are perceived to be muslim, arab, sikh, south asian, hindu or palestinian based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics. again and again, trump has shown us who he is on the issue of hate. he rubs shoulders with and encourages white supremacists, even launching his campaign with a meeting with white supremacist, antisemite, and holocaust denier nick fuentes. he called white supremacist and openly-antisemitic charlottesville protesters “very fine people.” he reportedly thinks hitler “did some good things” and echoes his hateful rhetoric about immigrants, including that they’re “poisoning the blood of our country.” he will reinstate his disgraceful muslim ban if he’s elected, continuing his long history of islamophobia. and he fueled anti-asian hate as the aanhpi community faced a spike in hate crimes surrounding the covid- pandemic. democrats condemn the decades-long campaign to demonize the muslim community and will end policies that target american muslims as security threats. we will combat hate crimes and white nationalist terrorism. we will prioritize the investigation of hate crimes against trans and non-binary people. and we will continue to increase security at houses of worship. president biden deeply believes everyone must be able to practice their faith without fear. that’s why democrats will protect the first amendment right to free exercise of religion for everyone, and we will maintain the separation of church and state. in contrast, the trump administration attacked religious freedom by demonizing some faiths and preferring others. we will advocate for religious freedom across the world. and, we will continue to honor both religious freedom and other civil rights, not put them at war with one another. this critical work is led by ambassador rashad hussain, the first muslim to serve as ambassador at large for international religious freedom. and we will continue to recognize faith communities’ acts of service, which are critical pillars of their communities. that’s one reason why president biden reestablished the white house office of faith-based and neighborhood partnerships — so that the government can work better with faith and community groups to serve people in need. freedom of the press freedom of the press is foundational to our nation, and president biden is committed to safeguarding it. that’s why he has called for the immediate and unconditional release of journalists who have been locked up abroad for doing their jobs. he is taking action to combat crimes against journalists, strengthen security for independent media outlets, and provide legal support for investigative journalists around the world. and his administration brought together a coalition to counter proliferation and misuse of commercial spyware. democrats reject trump’s denigration of the free press and recognize its importance to our society. we will strengthen media ownership rules and direct federal antitrust agencies to investigate media mergers, pushing back on the potentially harmful effects of corporate consolidation. and we will appoint an independent media professional to head the u.s. agency for global media. arts & humanities america is a great nation in large part because of the power of the arts and humanities that’s embedded in the dna of america. the administration has taken historic action to support the arts, helping libraries, theaters, concert halls, and other venues stay afloat during the pandemic. the administration has strengthened the national endowment for the arts, institute of museum and library services, and the national endowment for the humanities. president biden also reestablished the president’s committee on the arts and the humanities and signed an executive order to make art more accessible to people from underserved communities, elevate new voices through the arts and humanities, and expand opportunities for artists and scholars. he has celebrated and elevated the arts by hosting performances and screenings, and has awarded national humanities medals, national medals of arts, and hosted kennedy center honorees at the white house. democrats value the humanities, arts and art education for developing imagination, creativity, innovation, and critical thinking, and for building bridges within and between our communities. we will promote arts funding and education — and we will invest in the arts and humanities accordingly. democrats will fund the national endowment for the arts, the national endowment for the humanities, and art and music education in public schools. democrats know that federal grants for cultural organizations, artists, scholars, library systems, museums, and state and local governments only strengthen our communities and our cultural heritage. d.c., puerto rico, territories president biden, vice president harris, and democrats have made historic investments in washington, d.c., puerto rico, the u.s. virgin islands, guam, the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands, and american samoa – delivering billions for infrastructure, semiconductor, clean energy, and transportation projects, and creating thousands of good jobs. democrats reject the unequal treatment of residents of d.c., puerto rico, and the u.s. territories. we unequivocally support statehood for d.c., which its residents overwhelmingly support but republicans blocked from even getting a vote in the senate. democrats recognize that the people of puerto rico have earned and deserve to resolve the political status questions. for this reason, democrats support the enactment of the puerto rico status act/h.r. , and promote full civic and political representation for puerto ricans. we will work to end its unequal treatment by the federal government, and fight to provide equal access to federal programs like medicaid, snap, and the ctc. democrats reject trump’s failed response to hurricane maria, which devastated puerto rico, and will ensure that the federal government’s response to disasters in puerto rico is as urgent as it would be anywhere else in the country. when disaster does strike, we will speed access to recovery funds to help rebuild. we will build on the administration’s investments to invest further in energy, infrastructure, economic development, education, health care, housing, energy, and climate resilience. we will help restructure puerto rico’s debt to relieve its debt burden, and we will work to dissolve the financial oversight and management board. democrats also support self-determination for the u.s. virgin islands, guam, the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands, and american samoa. we will create a congressional task force to study equal voting rights and house representation; and we will work to ensure equal access to federal programs like veterans’ benefits, the affordable care act, medicaid, and snap food assistance for all those eligible. democrats support funding to improve critical health care facilities in the territories, including construction of a state-of-the-art medical complex in guam that co-locates health agencies on a single campus for a more integrated healthcare system that will benefit the region. we will also invest in ending disparities in agriculture, economic development, education, employment, energy, health care, housing, and infrastructure, and help the u.s. territories diversify their economies. we will help them recover from natural disasters, and we will invest in expanding clean energy and water systems to be more resilient. democrats support reimbursing u.s. territories for more migration costs, including restoring medicaid eligibility for legal migrants under the compacts of free association. and democrats will continue to recognize the sacrifices and honor the contributions of residents who suffered because of their u.s. nationality during the japanese occupation during world war ii. democrats also recognize that millions of u.s. citizens live abroad, and we will consider their unique circumstances and challenges when shaping policy. we will work to protect their voting rights and ensure they’re able to participate in the democratic process here at home. chapter seven: securing our border & fixing the broken immigration system since our founding, immigrants have traveled to america to pursue freedom and opportunity, to flee oppression, and to reunite with family members, and in turn have made our country stronger. president biden has led with the conviction that we must secure our border and fix a broken immigration system decades in the making. through it all, the united states must continue to be a beacon of hope and opportunity. on his first day in office, president biden sent congress legislation to secure our border, fix our immigration system, and provide a pathway to citizenship for dreamers and others. this past year, the president worked across the aisle and negotiated a bipartisan deal that included the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border in decades. it would have made our country safer and made our border more secure, while treating people fairly and humanely and expanding legal immigration, consistent with our values as a nation. congress failed to act because republicans, led by donald trump, would rather play politics than solve problems. trump’s plans for a second term will devastate our economy and tear families apart. trump has said that if he’s elected, he’ll move to immediately deport millions of undocumented immigrants, including those who have lived in and contributed to this country for years. he and his allies have also promised to end birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented individuals, ignore the constitution and supreme court precedent and bar undocumented children from public schools, and once again separate children from their families. trump’s plans are out of line with american values, and congressional republicans are currently blocking president biden’s bipartisan border security proposals because they lack the courage to stand up to trump. president biden has led a hemispheric response to the challenge of irregular migration, launching and leading the los angeles declaration for migration and protection with countries to increase enforcement, expand legal pathways to citizenship, and stabilize and integrate migrants in neighboring countries. president biden has taken decisive action to secure our border through executive actions that have significantly restricted eligibility for asylum at the border and created innovative legal pathways to the u.s. that, when coupled with strong enforcement, have decreased illegal border crossings. since president biden announced new border restrictions in june , the number of unlawful crossings has fallen by percent, demonstrating that the policy works. he has also implemented policies that have stopped record amounts of fentanyl from crossing our border. president biden has done all of this while ensuring that people are treated humanely and with dignity. as one of his first actions, president biden established the interagency task force on the reunification of families, which as of march has reunited nearly children with their parents in the united states that were separated in trump’s presidency. in president biden’s second term, he will push congress to pass legislation that is consistent with our values as a nation. legislation must secure the border, reform the asylum system, expand legal immigration; and keep families together by supporting a pathway for long-term undocumented individuals, improving the work authorization process, and securing the future of the daca program. president biden has taken action to advance each of these goals, but lasting, comprehensive reforms require congressional action. securing the border the president has already taken steps to increase border resources, working within the limits imposed by congress. he has increased the number of agents and officers on the southwest border to over ,, added thousands of additional support personnel, surged thousands of law enforcement and other personnel from across the department of homeland security, and secured the first significant increase of border patrol agents in more than a decade. the bipartisan infrastructure law modernized border stations and land border ports of entry. the administration is providing support to cities and states, on the border and across the country, that are sheltering migrants. he has also taken executive actions, including launching expedited immigration court dockets, to more quickly resolve immigration cases for those crossing the southern border and remove those who do not establish a legal basis to remain. president biden has repeatedly asked congress for additional resources to secure our border, including increases for personnel that are critically needed to quickly deliver consequences at the border to those who cross unlawfully. the department of homeland security requested funds to hire , border patrol agents and , asylum officers. meanwhile, the bipartisan senate bill would have provided an additional , customs and border protection personnel and , asylum officers. congressional republicans continue to play partisan politics with the security of our border instead of working with democrats to fund these critically needed resources for dhs and border communities. in president biden's second term, he will push congress to provide the resources and authorities that we need to secure the border. this includes additional border patrol agents, immigration judges, asylum officers, cutting-edge inspection machines to help detect and stop the flow of fentanyl, and funding for cities and states that are sheltering migrants. reform the asylum system congress must pass legislation to reform our asylum system modeled after the bipartisan senate deal so that we can quickly identify and provide protection to those who are fleeing persecution and ensure it is not used as an alternative to legal immigration by others. democrats believe that asylum processing should be efficient and fair, and that those who are determined not to have a legal basis to remain should be quickly removed. in order to achieve this, we need congress to strengthen requirements for valid asylum claims. congress must also finally fund a sufficient number of asylum officers and immigration judges to facilitate timely decisions. in addition, asylum seekers, especially the most vulnerable, including unaccompanied children, should have access to legal counsel. individuals who pass this strengthened initial screening and are determined to be likely to qualify for asylum should be given quick access to work authorization while they go through a streamlined court process. after congress repeatedly failed to act, president biden announced executive action that significantly curtailed asylum eligibility at the border when crossings reach a certain threshold and strengthened our ability to impose timely consequences for crossing the border illegally. those who attempt to cross into the united states unlawfully are being quickly returned to their home countries, as well as mexico. since the president took this action, unlawful entries between ports of entry declined by more than half. and, president biden is changing the asylum process to more quickly screen and identify individuals who pose a threat to national security or public safety so that they can be swiftly removed. temporary emergency authority to shut down the border when the system is overwhelmed, the president should have emergency authority to expel migrants who are crossing unlawfully and stop processing asylum claims except for those using a safe and orderly process at ports of entry. the authority should be accompanied by humanitarian exceptions for vulnerable populations including unaccompanied children and victims of trafficking. congress should also dedicate resources to detain and remove individuals quickly, and rapidly process those who cannot be detained in a non-custodial setting under government supervision. those who pose a threat to public safety or national security must be identified and removed as quickly as possible. fighting human trafficking we need more resources and congressional authorization to increase penalties to prosecute and punish human smugglers and traffickers who prey upon families and migrants. president bid en has already taken numerous steps to go after these bad actors including by revoking the visas of private sector ceos and sanctioning government officials who profit from migrants coming to the u.s. unlawfully, and by expanding efforts to dismantle human smuggling and prosecute offenders. president biden also established joint task force alpha, a law enforcement task force that marshals the investigative and prosecutorial resources of the department of justice, in partnership with the department of homeland security (dhs), to enhance u.s. enforcement efforts against the most prolific and dangerous human smuggling and trafficking groups operating in mexico and the northern triangle countries of guatemala, el salvador, and honduras. joint task force alpha has delivered significant results, including: over u.s. convictions against leaders, organizers, and significant facilitators of human trafficking and substantial seizures and forfeitures of assets including cash, property, and firearms. cracking down on trafficking illicit fentanyl president biden has made fighting the trafficking of fentanyl a top priority. he has seized record amounts of fentanyl at our border— and arrested more individuals for fentanyl-related crimes in the last two years than in the previous five years combined— and secured funding for more cutting-edge inspection machines to help detect fentanyl at our southwest border. he also issued an executive order to go after the global illicit fentanyl trade, which led to the imposition of sanctions on some persons and entities. president biden has also continued working with mexico to extradite and prosecute key fentanyl traffickers, and negotiated the resumption of bilateral cooperation on counternarcotics with china, which had been stalled since . as a result of these efforts, the number of fentanyl-related deaths has started to decline for the first time in five years. in his second term, president biden will work with congress to deploy more cutting-edge inspection machines to help detect fentanyl at our ports of entry. he will also leverage all resources of the federal government to stop tech platforms from being used for criminal conduct, including sales of dangerous drugs like fentanyl. expanding legal immigration & deterring illegal immigration america is a nation of immigrants. the legal immigration framework was last updated in and does not reflect the needs of our country in the 21st century. many immigrants today are forced to wait years, and often decades, to immigrate lawfully to the united states. a robust immigration system with accessible lawful pathways and penalties for illegal immigration alleviates pressure at the border and upholds our values. the u.s. citizenship act would permanently increase family-sponsored and employment-based immigration. the bipartisan border legislation would increase the number of immigrant visas that are available by , over years. legal immigration pathways while we wait for congress to act, president biden has used his authority to provide orderly, legal immigration pathways for those fleeing violence, and decrease the number of illegal border crossings. the biden-harris administration established a humanitarian parole process for cubans, haitians, nicaraguans, and venezuelans (chnv), which allows people from these four countries who have a sponsor in the u.s. and who pass a background check to come to the u.s. for a period of two years to live and work lawfully. border encounters from these nationalities decreased by percent in the first six months after chnv was put in place —incentivizing migrants to stay in place, rather than make the dangerous journey to our southwest border. he also established new family reunification parole processes to allow eligible individuals from el salvador, guatemala, honduras, colombia, cuba and haiti to be reunited with family in the united states while they wait to complete the process for securing lawful permanent residence. the united states has long been a leader in refugee resettlement, providing a beacon of hope for persecuted people around the world, facilitating international efforts to address record displacement, and demonstrating the generosity and core values of the american people. after trump decimated the program, president biden rebuilt the u.s. refugee admissions program, which is now on track to admit more than , refugees this fiscal year, the most in three decades. the administration also established safe mobility offices in countries throughout the western hemisphere, where migrants can be processed for refugee admission or referred to resettlement programs elsewhere - rather than making their way to our border. and, the administration expanded opportunities for communities and individual americans to sponsor and welcome refugees to the united states. president biden has worked closely with partners throughout the region – including, most importantly, the government of mexico – to undertake coordinated actions to stop the flow of migrants before they reach our border. and he has supported our regional partners through the la declaration process – working together on coordinated enforcement, development of lawful pathways, and efforts to address the root causes of migration. as outlined in the u.s. citizenship act, congress must act to increase the number of family-sponsored and employment-based immigrant visas that are available each fiscal year so that people aren’t forced to wait decades for a visa. legislation should also include provisions to ensure that children who came as dependents on their parents’ temporary visas can remain in the united states with their families, even after turning , provisions to streamline applications of at-risk afghan allies to the u.s. refugee admissions program, and a process for afghan evacuees to have their status adjusted to lawful permanent resident. legislation should also extend work authorization to those who utilize lawful visa pathways so that families can more quickly get on the path to economic self-sufficiency. this includes k-, k-, and k- nonimmigrant visa holders (fiancés, spouses, children of u.s. citizens), and the spouses and children of high-skilled temporary visa holders. and, democrats will explore opportunities to identify or create work permits for immigrants, long-term undocumented residents, and legally processed asylum seekers in our country. congress should also increase the number of visas for the special immigrant juvenile status program for abused, abandoned, or neglected youth, building on actions that the administration has already taken to provide deferred action and work authorization for juveniles in this program. keeping families together and supporting long-term undocumented individuals, including dreamers in , then-vice president biden worked alongside president obama to establish the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program. since then, president biden has taken steps to support undocumented people and families, including dreamers and daca recipients. president biden has vigorously defended daca against legal challenges in the courts, and has extended affordable care act coverage to daca recipients for the first time. in addition, president biden is taking action to make it easier for dreamers, including daca recipients, who have earned a higher education degree in the united states and have a job offer to more quickly receive work visas. and, the administration allowed undocumented workers in labor disputes to apply for deferred action so that they are not afraid to report violations of labor law. trump tried to end the daca program in his first term and will do so again if re-elected. president biden also announced new actions to keep an estimated , american families together by allowing certain noncitizen spouses and children of u.s. citizens who have been in the country for years or more to apply for lawful permanent residence —a status they’re already eligible for —without leaving the country first. the average beneficiary has been in the united states for more than years, and will finally be able to come out of the shadows and fully contribute to our communities. president biden has also taken steps to preserve and expand temporary protected status (tps) for individuals from countries experiencing armed conflicts, natural disasters, or other crises, giving thousands authorization to live and work in the united states without fear of deportation for a temporary period. since , dhs – which oversees the program – has added afghanistan, cameroon, ethiopia, myanmar, ukraine and venezuela to the list of tps-eligible countries. dhs has also extended tps for immigrants from most countries that were already covered by tps, including the countries that trump attempted to terminate. congress must pass legislation to provide a pathway to citizenship for dreamers, farmworkers, careworkers, and other long-term undocumented individuals who contribute to this country, by paying taxes and contributing to their local economies, and in his second term, president biden will continue pressing them to do so. fast, efficient immigration decisions immigration officers have to make the right decisions, and they also have to make them quickly and efficiently. under the administration, u.s. citizenship and immigration services (uscis) has cut processing times significantly for those awaiting work authorizatio n and ensured that immigration decisions – including naturalization and work permit applications – are made fairly and as quickly as possible. as of april , the administration achieved the lowest wait time for naturalization since and the lowest wait time for work authorization documents from certain categories of applicants since . in fy , uscis administered the oath of allegiance to more than , new u.s. citizens, including , members of the military, effectively eliminating the backlog of naturalization applications. it also reduced the median processing time for naturalization from . months to . months. the administration has also partnered with state governments and non-profit groups to host work authorization clinics, which have eased the burden on american communities by helping migrants support their families and move out of emergency shelter into more stable housing options. it will also help to fund community-based organizations that host clinics to assist with immigration cases. to make scheduling appointments at u.s. ports of entry safer and more orderly, the administration launched cbpone, a free online tool available to migrants in parts of mexico. scheduling appointments makes the process at our border safer and more orderly, and the advance information that is submitted to cbp creates a more efficient and streamlined process for cbp and for individuals. cbpone has increased administrative processing capacity fivefold since its introduction. chapter eight: advancing the president’s unity agenda since the day he took office, president biden promised to be a president for all americans. he knows that we agree on a lot more than we disagree on. during his first state of the union, president biden outlined a unity agenda to make progress solving big challenges that americans have in common: beating the opioid epidemic, tackling the mental health crisis, holding big tech accountable, ending cancer as we know it, and meeting our nation’s sacred obligation to veterans. under president biden’s leadership, democrats worked across the aisle to make real progress on these critical issues. we’re providing life-saving treatment for opioid use disorder to end the epidemic, making historic investments in mental health care to help struggling americans, establishing new high standards for ai safety and protecting american privacy, bringing together providers, insurers, and researchers to work toward ending cancer, and passed the pact act to expand health care benefits to veterans. donald trump divides us for his own political gain. he refuses to reach across the aisle to deliver results for working families, and he will cut veterans’ benefits, mental health care for kids, opioid treatment, and cancer research. beating the opioid epidemic for too long, the scourge of opioids has torn through our communities, ripping apart families and shattering lives. our nation’s opioid epidemic impacts americans in every corner of the country, from small towns to large cities to tribal lands. far too many americans have lost loved ones to addiction and overdose. the biden-harris administration is strengthening prevention, investing in treatment, and expanding recovery support services. the administration has increased the number of medical providers who can initiate treatment from , to million and made historic investments in the state opioid response program to help states deliver free treatment services to over . million people and enabled states to reverse more than , overdoses. to curb opioid overdoses, the administration is making naloxone, an overdose-prevention drug, available over-the-counter at grocery stores and pharmacies. they also took steps to increase access to naloxone at federal facilities, and ended a requirement for length of addiction before entering treatment. democrats will continue these critical investments in life-saving medication and care for americans struggling with addiction and most at risk of overdose. as president, trump failed to mount an effective and coherent strategy to prevent overdoses. under his watch, opioid-related deaths spiked, and now, he’s promising once again to repeal the affordable care act. if he’s allowed back in the white house, many americans who struggle with addiction will lose critical, live-saving health care. investing in mental health the pandemic exacerbated feelings of sadness, isolation, and loneliness across the country and strained our health care system, including mental health services. president biden, vice president harris, and democrats know mental health care is health care. for millions of americans, that essential mental health care is out of reach. in , less than half of all adults with a mental illness diagnosis received care for it and it’s worse for kids – nearly percent of children who need mental health care cannot get it. that’s why democrats are taking steps to dramatically expand access to mental health care in america. the administration launched ,the national suicide & crisis lifeline, which has connected nearly million americans in crisis to immediate, confidential, and free support from trained counselors. and, the national maternal mental health hotline has received more than , calls and texts, to help mothers and their loved ones navigate mental health issues. democrats will push to expand to handle increased capacity and serve more americans. at the same time, we must make it easier for all americans to access high-quality mental health and substance use treatment by recruiting and training more professionals to deliver culturally and linguistically competent, high-quality behavioral health care; and by strengthening coverage across all health plans. and we must extend workforce development and incentive programs. the administration is delivering $ billion to hire or train , school-based mental health counselors – the largest investment in school-based mental health in history – thanks to the bipartisan safer communities act. and, it is delivering additional resources to support students who need mental health care. as mental health care becomes increasingly expensive, democrats are pushing for permanent funding for certified community behavioral health clinics, which provide / crisis care and treatment for mental health and substance use disorders, regardless of individuals’ ability to pay. and, the president is calling for additional resources to connect more americans to affordable care at work and at school. president biden, vice president harris, and democrats are working to ensure full mental health parity so that mental health care is covered the same as physical health care. we’re strengthening mental health parity requirements and closing insurance loopholes for the more than million americans with private health insurance. and, the president is calling on congress to expand medicare’s coverage for mental health care, applying the same parity protections to medicare beneficiaries. trump has a different vision. when he was president, he proposed cuts to medicare, medicaid, and rollbacks of mental health funding. protecting kids online, strengthening americans’ data privacy, & promoting competition tech platforms and companies help keep us connected, inspire ideas and innovation, and create a global marketplace. at the same time, they collect, share, and exploit data; risk our children’s mental health; and deepen extremism and polarization. there is growing scientific evidence for what so many americans already know: social media and other online platforms can affect our mental health and well-being – particularly for our kids. in addition, a handful of dominant tech platforms and companies increasingly control much of the market, allowing them to exercise enormous power over americans’ daily lives – and, too often, use that power to exclude competitors and undermine consumers and innovation. president biden believes that all companies, including technology companies, should be held accountable for the harm they cause. the president has raised the alarm that social media and other platforms have allowed abusive and even criminal conduct like cyberstalking, child sexual exploitation, and non-consensual intimate images to proliferate on their sites – and called on democrats and republicans to unite on legislation to address these issues. the surgeon general issued an advisory warning about the impacts of social media on youth mental health, noting that he cannot conclude social media is safe for children and adolescents. democrats will pass bipartisan legislation to protect kids' privacy and to stop big tech from collecting personal data on kids and teenagers online, ban targeted advertising to children, and put stricter limits on the personal data these companies collect on all of us. and, the administration has strengthened legal protections for survivors and victims of non-consensual intimate imagery, including those generated by ai, building on the federal civil cause of action established under the violence against women act reauthorization of . president biden has also called on democrats and republicans to pass bipartisan legislation to promote competition and privacy in the tech industry. important policies include promoting interoperability between tech services and platforms, allowing users to control and transfer their data, and preventing large platforms from giving their own products and services an unfair advantage in the marketplace. we must also fundamentally reform section of the communications decency act, which shields tech platforms from liability even when they host or disseminate violent or illegal content, to ensure that platforms take responsibility for the content they share. democrats are determined to strengthen data privacy. the president issued an executive order to protect america’s sensitive personal data from commercial data brokers, identity thieves, and foreign intelligence actors. and, the federal trade commission is cracking down on commercial surveillance and taking on technology companies for illegally retaining children’s data. we must do more and update and pass the consumer privacy bill of rights, protect student data privacy by ensuring what is collected in schools is only used for education, and update the electronic communications privacy act to protect personal electronic information and safeguard location information. seizing the promise and managing the risks of ai artificial intelligence (ai) holds extraordinary potential for both promise and peril. while ai is helping to cure diseases, predict the weather, and transform education, it’s also being used to clone voices, commit fraud, institutionalize bias, and undermine democracy. we need to act now and act fast to realize the promise of ai and manage its risks to ensure that ai serves the public interest. democrats are finding solutions to make sure that as ai’s capabilities grow, we can manage the implications for americans’ rights, safety and security. president biden issued a landmark executive order directing federal agencies to establish new high standards for ai safety and security, protect americans’ privacy, advance equity and civil rights, stand up for workers and consumers, promote competitive markets for ai development and use, and more. democrats are committed to ensuring that workers get a voice in how ai is used in their workplace and that they share fairly in any economic gains ai produces. we know that ai can deepen discrimination, bias, and other abuses in justice, health care, education, and housing. that’s why the administration has already taken action by publishing the blueprint for an ai bill of rights and issuing new guidance from federal agencies on combating algorithmic discrimination across the economy. as ai becomes more prevalent, it’s critical we have the brightest minds working to understand new technologies. the administration launched an ai talent surge to accelerate hiring ai professionals across the federal government, launched a pilot program to enhance successful initiatives for training additional scientists in ai, and created the ai safety institute at the national institute of standards and technology (nist) to set rigorous standards for extensive testing of powerful ai models to ensure safety before public release. during president biden’s second term, democrats will continue to advocate for the safe and secure development of ai. we will invest in the ai safety institute to create guidelines, tools, benchmarks, and best practices for evaluating dangerous capabilities and mitigating ai risk. we will also prioritize funding for critical ai research and development that advances ai safety. we will also ban voice impersonations, and president biden will take action to provide heightened protections in critical sectors such as health care, financial services, education, housing, and transportation. finally, we will make sure that we responsibly develop, test, procure, integrate transformative ai across the federal government. ending cancer as we know it cancer has touched nearly every single american family. as we honor the enormous courage and strength of the millions of americans facing the disease, we're working to end cancer as we know it and get patients and families the quality care and support that they deserve. the president and first lady re-launched the cancer moonshot in to reduce the nation’s cancer death rate by at least half and improve the experience of people who are touched by cancer. the cancer moonshot has already announced more than new programs, policies, and resources, including commitments from seven leading insurance companies to reimburse for navigation services, new actions from comprehensive cancer centers and community oncology practices to bring effective navigation support to underserved communities, and established insurance codes so practices, including medicare providers, have a way to bill for patient navigation services. the administration launched the advanced research projects agency for health (arpa-h), which is supercharging high-impact research and development to improve american health outcomes and deliver breakthroughs on cancer. president biden is calling on the private sector to develop and test new treatments, make drugs more affordable, and share more data and knowledge that can inform the public and benefit every company’s research. we’re supporting these initiatives by providing funds to essential programs for cancer research and health care like the national cancer institute (nci), fda, center of disease control (cdc), veterans affairs (va), indian health service (ihs), and arpa-h. trump will set back our progress finding treatments for cancer and other diseases - he proposed cutting funding for critical scientific research at the national institutes of health (nih). and, he and republicans loosened regulations to get rid of toxic chemicals that cause cancer and made it easier for chemical companies to poison our air, water, and land. with a second term in office, president biden will continue to work to prevent cancer, detect it early, deliver innovation, care for families facing cancer, and, ultimately, end cancer as we know it. meeting our nation’s sacred obligation to veterans and military families president biden believes that our nation has no more sacred obligation than providing for our military service members when they’re sent into harm’s way and caring for them and their families after they come home. trump called members of the military who died in war “suckers” and “losers.” he disparages the brave men and women who wear our uniform and protect our democracy and national security. and, as president, he pushed to cut funding for veterans’ benefits. president biden signed into law more than bipartisan bills addressing critical issues facing veterans, service members, and families today. he signed the pact act – the most significant expansion of health care benefits and services for veterans in more than years – which expands va eligibility and services to veterans who were exposed to toxic substances. thanks to the pact act, more than , veterans and survivors are now receiving new service-connected disability benefits, making care and benefits available to veterans battling over medical conditions. democrats are also taking steps to support veterans’ mental health and decrease the scourge of veteran suicides by expanding mental health screenings, increasing access to legal and financial support, and hiring more mental health professionals at the va. president biden took historic action to end sexual assault and domestic violence in the military by calling for the establishment of the independent review commission on sexual assault and then implementing the commission’s recommendations to better protect survivors. the administration will prioritize the effective implementation of the military justice improvement and increasing prevention act, including by successfully operating the offices of special trial counsel within the military services branches, and the office of the chief prosecutor of the u.s. coast guard. we’re also taking steps to boost access to affordable and stable housing for all veterans, who often face a high risk of homelessness, with a focus on women veterans. last year alone, the va helped more than , veterans and their families stay in their homes and permanently housed more than , veterans. the administration awarded more than $ billion in grant funding to help homeless veterans and house their families and launched a first-of-its-kind funding for legal services for veterans experiencing or at risk of homelessness to support accessing government benefits, navigating family law, ensuring access to safe housing, and assisting with debt. the veteran scam and fraud evasion (vsafe) task force has cracked down on scams targeting veterans, and the new national veterans financial resource center has promoted financial stability, literacy, and debt management for veterans. the va is making it easier and faster for veterans to get their va medical debt forgiven. our commitment to our veterans and military members extends to those who care for and support them. that’s why president biden signed an executive order to help military spouses obtain and maintain careers in the federal government. the department of defense and the department of state also took action to ensure military spouses can keep their federal jobs when their loved ones are stationed overseas. president biden has made child care more affordable and accessible for military families, and signed an executive order providing financial support for military-connected caregivers. going forward, we will continue to implement the pact act; and we will strengthen va care by fully funding inpatient and outpatient care and long-term care, and by upgrading medical facility infrastructure. we will also improve and increase access to mental health care, expand suicide prevention, and invest in opioid overdose prevention and treatment. democrats are also determined to expand women veterans’ health care and access to benefits, and to continue implementing key independent review commission on sexual assault recommendations. with a second term in office and a majority in congress, we will fulfill our promise to end veteran homelessness and support military students with disabilities. democrats will strengthen their support for military families by making child care more affordable and accessible, expanding job opportunities for spouses, and investing in a stipend for caregivers. we will also continue implementing the military spouse executive order and ensure the federal government is an employer of choice for military families. in recognition of our nation’s greatest heroes, we will expand memorial benefits to honor their years of service and lasting memories. chapter nine: strengthening american leadership worldwide we live in a period of significant global change. the world is at an inflection point between those who argue that autocracy – rule by dictators or single leaders – is the answer to facing today’s challenges and those who understand that democracy – rule by the people – is essential to moving our world forward and uplifting people everywhere. president biden believes at this decisive moment we must demonstrate that democracy can still deliver for our people. we must rally the world to address the challenges that impact all of us, from climate change and global health to human rights, technology, food security, and inclusive economic growth. the challenges of the current moment require us to revisit old assumptions and invest in new sources of american power. we have seen aggression from authoritarian powers, the destabilizing impact of a global pandemic, the growing existential danger of the climate crisis, the awesome power of emerging technologies, and the shared vulnerabilities that underlie the 21st century global economy. most importantly, these challenges underscore how lives and livelihoods across the world are increasingly interdependent. for too long, american foreign policy was conducted as if our domestic challenges were disconnected from global ones. president biden understands that the two go hand-in-hand, and that leading abroad means being strong and resilient at home. he also knows that the united states is strongest when our partners are strong too. that’s why he has met the challenges of his first term – including the russian invasion of ukraine, the existential threat of climate change, and intense strategic competition with china – by leading coalitions of nations who share our values to stand together. donald trump made america less safe by significantly straining u.s. alliances and emboldening autocratic regimes, while weakening global democratic norms. he insulted our allies and withdrew from international agreements and organizations that were in the national security interest. trump praises dictators, including vladimir putin, and attempted to weaken the nato alliance. and, he repeatedly disrespected the brave men and women in the u.s. military. when he entered office, president biden moved to quickly and decisively repair the damage that trump had done to america’s relationships with our allies and our reputation around the world. trump’s america first strategy meant america was alone, less secure, less prosperous, and with american leadership and values falling behind worldwide. by reinvesting in america’s manufacturing base, leveling the playing field for american workers, and standing alongside our allies to support democracies and push back against autocracy, president biden has bolstered our national security and is investing in a future where america will continue to lead on the world stage. europe during president biden’s first term, no region of the world has better illustrated the importance of our alliances than europe. when vladimir putin launched his reckless war of aggression against ukraine, he sought to shake the very foundations of the free world. he thought he could roll into ukraine and that ukraine and the world would roll over. he was wrong. instead, he met the determination of the ukrainian people. he also enhanced the resolve of nato, the greatest military alliance in the history of the world, led by the united states. under president biden’s leadership, the united states has been steadfast in standing alongside our european allies to defend principles of sovereignty, deter further russian aggression, protect our shared values, and make critical investments to ensure the security of the united states and our transatlantic allies in the years to come. president biden has pursued three core objectives in ukraine: help ukraine defend its sovereignty, maintain unity in our transatlantic alliances, and prevent escalation into direct conflict with russia. on all three fronts, the united states has succeeded. under president biden’s leadership, america has provided ukraine with the weapons as well as the diplomatic and economic support needed to defend its sovereignty from russian aggression. that work has created good paying american jobs as we build the arsenal to defend ourselves at home and help protect democracy abroad. alongside our allies, the united states has rallied a coalition of approximately nations to provide much needed security assistance to ukraine and coordinated unprecedented international actions to impose tough sanctions on russia and hold putin accountable on the world stage. the biden-harris administration has also helped protect ukraine’s civilian population and energy infrastructure from unprovoked russian attacks and worked to resume trade of ukrainian agricultural products to support global food security. under president biden’s leadership, nato is stronger and more united than ever and has bolstered its ranks by adding two highly capable allies: sweden and finland. nato nations are meeting their financial commitments as well, with nato countries on track to meet a spending target of percent of gdp on defense in – up from countries in . president biden has also made clear that he considers the percent goal to be a floor not a ceiling, and he continues to press the alliance to do even more to bolster collective defenses. more broadly, the administration has deepened cooperation with europe to confront a range of shared challenges. president biden has worked with our european allies to manage competition with china, resolve disputes between america and the european union, and address long-standing conflicts in the balkans and caucasus and persistent trade issues across the continent. the us-eu trade and technology council has established rules of the road on global economic and technology issues. the united states and united kingdom ai safety institutes have agreed on a common approach to developing artificial intelligence safely. and president biden has led the development of the us-eu energy council to counter the effects of russia’s invasion of ukraine. president biden has also been willing to lead where other presidents have not, becoming the first president to recognize the armenian genocide. the threat posed by russia transcends its war of aggression in ukraine. russia is enlisting north korea, iran and china in its efforts to attack freedom across the world through military equipment sales and economic partnerships. by strengthening our alliances in europe and indo-pacific, and strengthening the connections among our allies, including by inviting our indo-pacific allies to participate in the nato summits in madrid, vilnius, and washington, dc, the united states is countering russia’s disruptive actions no matter where they occur. where president biden has made strengthening and reassuring our allies a priority, trump has repeatedly threatened to withdraw america from the world’s most powerful military alliance and has invited vladimir putin to “do whatever the hell he wants” to any nato country. while president biden has always stood by ukraine, trump attempted to help his own political prospects by extorting president zelenskyy – including by withholding much needed security assistance. and, now behind closed doors, trump is supporting a policy of pushing ukraine to surrender sovereign territory to putin. president biden will never turn his back on our allies. in his second term, he will continue to stand with ukraine to stop putin’s atrocities and constrain russia’s threat to allied nations and america’s vital interests. in addition to continuing to strengthen nato, he will help ukraine recover economically and support ongoing efforts to strengthen ukraine’s democracy and deepen its political and economic relationship with european and transatlantic institutions. president biden will continue to work closely with the eu on emerging political and economic challenges and work with our european and indo-pacific allies to disrupt russia’s emerging military and economic alliances with iran and north korea. indo-pacific the united states is an indo-pacific power. the region, stretching from our pacific coastline to the indian ocean, is home to more than half of the world’s people, nearly two-thirds of the world’s economy, and seven of the world’s largest militaries. in the years ahead, as the region drives as much as two-thirds of global economic growth, its influence will only grow – as will its importance to the united states. president biden understands that standing up for the rules of the road in the indo-pacific, and standing by our allies, makes us safer. that is why he has maintained a commitment to freedom of navigation across the indo-pacific, standing with the philippines and other allies and partners to push back against hostile actions and coercion by china. he also worked to expand our military presence in japan and secure access to strategic sites in the philippines through a new defense cooperation agreement – steps that will help deter future regional aggression. across the indo-pacific, president biden has prioritized strengthening key multilateral partnerships. he elevated the quad – which brings together the democratic strength of the united states, australia, india, and japan – to unleash new forms of regional cooperation on technology, climate, health, and maritime security. he founded aukus – a partnership among the united states, united kingdom, and australia – to better integrate the defense industrial bases of two of our closest allies and to produce conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines and increase cooperation on advanced capabilities such as artificial intelligence, autonomous platforms, and electronic warfare. under president biden’s leadership, the united states hosted a historic trilateral camp david summit with japan and south korea, enshrined the washington declaration with south korea, and extended trilateral deterrence discussions with japan. the administration has elevated our relationships with vietnam, indonesia, and asean to comprehensive strategic partnerships. it has intensified our engagement with vital regional fora in the indo-pacific, including hosting the leaders of the pacific islands forum and asean nations for face-to-face summits in washington, dc, and hosting the apec summit in san francisco. president biden is also investing in a twenty-first-century partnership between the united states and india that builds technology into the fabric of our cooperation through programs such as the u.s.-india initiative on critical and emerging technology. president biden has also worked alongside our allies to counter the threat posed by north korea’s destabilizing development of nuclear and missile programs, in violation of multiple un security council resolutions. by bolstering our trilateral cooperation with south korea and japan, we are maintaining peace and stability in the korean peninsula and beyond. trump took a different approach in the region, embarrassing the united states on the world stage including by flattering and legitimizing kim jong un, exchanging “love letters” with the north korean dictator. trump directly threatened our valued ally south korea with the withdrawal of u.s. troops stationed there over a trade dispute. president biden has and will stand by our allies, especially south korea, against north korea’s provocations, including its illegal build-up of missile capabilities. in his second term, president biden will continue to promote a free, open, connected, prosperous, secure, and resilient indo-pacific. he will deepen economic engagement to drive inclusive growth. he will champion human rights. and he will continue to strengthen our traditional alliances and broaden regional partnerships to bolster deterrence and resist coercion. china president biden recognizes that the people’s republic of china (prc) is america’s most consequential strategic competitor. the prc is the only global actor that combines the intention to fundamentally reshape the u.s.-led international order with an increasing military, economic, diplomatic, and technological capacity to do so. president biden understands the imperative of rising to this challenge while managing the competition between our countries responsibly. president biden has invested in our strengths at home and our alliances abroad to compete vigorously with china, but we do not seek conflict. he has maintained a steadfast commitment to being tough but smart towards the prc, relentlessly advancing u.s. interests and values while ensuring a floor of stability in the relationship with china. we will make no apology in pushing back on unfair trade practices that harm american workers. and we will guard against china taking advantage of america’s openness to use u.s. technologies against america, our allies, and our interests. against this backdrop, we seek to “de-risk” and diversify the economic relationship between our countries, not decouple. we will protect a targeted number of sensitive technologies with focused restrictions, creating a “small yard and a high fence” that preserves our national security. president biden has taken decisive action to counter unfair economic practices by the prc and level the playing field for american workers, strategically increasing tariffs on a variety of products such as steel and aluminum, semiconductors, electric vehicles, batteries, critical minerals, solar cells, ship-to-shore cranes, and medical products. president biden also knows that for america to succeed in future competition with china, we must continue to invest in our workers and industrial base now. that is why he issued an executive order on outbound investment, preserving and protecting american and allied national security interests by denying china access to most advanced technologies that allow them to develop their military and surveillance capacities. he also tightened restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence chips and manufacturing equipment, as well as semiconductor, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing technologies to china, stifling their military use of these technologies. and in areas where it is in the interests of the united states and the world for our two nations to work together – like addressing climate change and countering fentanyl trafficking – the united states will do so. president biden pushed china to take action to curb the flow of fentanyl into the americas, as well as to commit to climate change mitigation efforts as part of a global coalition. for all of this tough talk on china, trump failed to deliver results for the american people. his reckless proposal to raise tariffs by percent – not just on goods from china, but across the board on any imported goods from any country in the world – will cost american families an estimated $, a year. his threat of a percent tariff on chinese goods will add another $, annually. trump’s temper tantrums have harmed our alliances, and if he is elected, will hurt the american people. trump talks. president biden delivers. in his second term, president biden will remain focused on actions at home and abroad to outcompete china. he will continue to stand up to unfair economic practices, restrict the prc’s access to advanced technologies that could be used to harm american interests, and reshore supply chains for materials and technologies critical for the 21st century. the administration will continue to invest in our alliances and partnerships to ensure china cannot coerce its neighbors or overturn the international rules that keep america secure and prosperous. president biden will also remain steadfast in america’s commitment to peace and stability across the taiwan strait consistent with the u.s. one china policy – guided by the taiwan relations act, the three joint communiques, and the six assurances – in order to continue to ensure that there are no unilateral changes to the status quo from either side. even as we compete with china, the administration will continue to responsibly manage the relationship with the prc to avoid a costly spiral to conflict and seek to identify new areas where the united states and china may be able to work together, such as setting guardrails on the safe usage of artificial intelligence. the middle east & north africa president biden is working to build a durable peace in the middle east bolstered by regional integration, a strong coalition to counter and deter iran and prevent it and its terrorist proxies from threatening the security of the region, and a negotiated two-state solution that ensures israel’s future as a jewish and democratic state with recognized borders and upholds the right of palestinians to live in freedom and security in a viable state of their own. the terrorist group hamas sought to destroy the promise of that vision on october , , but they will not succeed. the united states strongly supports israel in the fight against hamas. and the hard work of diplomacy under the president's leadership has made real progress on a way forward that will free the hostages, establish a durable ceasefire, ease humanitarian suffering in gaza, and make possible normalization between israel and key arab states, together with meaningful progress and a political horizon for the palestinian people. president biden has spent decades working to advance u.s. interests and values in the middle east. as president, he has met with and worked alongside every key leader in the region to de-escalate conflicts, deter aggression and forge new ways to promote stability, prosperity, human security, and peace. president biden has long believed that partners and allies should be able to deter conflict and defend themselves in ways that safeguard human rights and prevent civilian harm. the administration has worked tirelessly to deepen and widen regional integration. in september , president biden announced a new economic corridor to connect india to europe through the uae, saudi arabia, jordan and israel. he also directed his administration to build on the abraham accords and work on a historic normalization deal between israel and saudi arabia, as a tangible sign of this normalization process, president biden helped negotiate the first-ever civilian aviation agreement between israel and saudi arabia, allowing for overflight of israeli civilian aircraft in saudi airspace and leading to a more integrated and economically connected middle east. through aggressive diplomacy backed by u.s. military power, the administration has worked alongside our allies and partners to deter and defend against iran and its terrorist surrogates. president biden has postured u.s. military forces in the region and authorized precision airstrikes on key iranian-linked targets tied to attacks against u.s. troops to deter further aggression by iran. president biden has also continued to protect the american people from terrorism, authorizing military strikes that took out isis emirs and the leader of al qaeda, ayman al-zawahiri. in response to brazen attacks by iranian-linked houthi forces against international commercial shipping, u.s. naval vessels in the red sea, and israel, president biden ordered military strikes, alongside key allies, against houthi targets and organized operation prosperity guardian, a coalition of more than nations committed to defending international shipping and deterring houthi attacks. when iran launched more than missiles and drones against israel in april , president biden led an unprecedented defensive coalition – together with partners from europe and across the middle east – to defeat the attack, protect israel, and stop the spread of a wider war. through direct defensive action by the u.s. military and its partners, iranian munitions did not cause significant damage, demonstrating both america’s ironclad commitment to the security of israel and our unrivaled ability to leverage growing regional integration among u.s. partners to counter iranian aggression. all of this stands in sharp contrast to trump's fecklessness and weakness in the face of iranian aggression during his presidency. in , when iranian-backed militias repeatedly attacked the u.s. consulate in basra, iraq trump’s only response was to close our diplomatic facility. in june , when iran shot down a u.s. surveillance aircraft operating in international airspace above the straits of hormuz, trump responded by tweet and then abruptly called off any actual retaliation, causing confusion and concern among his own national security team. in september , when iranian-backed groups threatened global energy markets by attacking saudi oil infrastructure, trump failed to respond against iran or its proxies. in january , when iran, for the first and only time in its history, directly launched ballistic missiles against u.s. troops in western iraq, trump mocked the resulting traumatic brain injuries suffered by dozens of american servicemembers as mere “headaches” – and again, took no action. the administration continues to manage the fallout from trump’s reckless and short-sighted decision to pull the united states out of the joint comprehensive plan of action to constrain iran’s nuclear weapons ambitions. iran was abiding by the agreement not to expand its nuclear capacity until trump’s costly mistake. since then, as a result, iran has gone from being more than a year away from being able to produce enough weapons grade material for a bomb to a matter of weeks, should it choose to do so. iran has continued to advance its nuclear program, increase the size and enrichment level of its uranium stockpile, and develop, manufacture, and operate advanced centrifuges. president biden remains committed to a diplomatic solution while standing resolute that iran will never be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. response to the october hamas attack on israel and next steps to a lasting peace for israelis and palestinians president biden and vice president harris believe a strong, secure, and democratic israel is vital to the interests of the united states. their commitment to israel’s security, its qualitative military edge, its right to defend itself, and the memorandum of understanding is ironclad. president biden and vice president harris recognize the worth of every innocent life, whether israeli or palestinian. president biden and vice president harris have unequivocally denounced hamas’s brutal attack on israel on october , condemned the gruesome violence – including conflict-related sexual violence – demonstrated by hamas and made clear that the united states wants to see hamas defeated. president biden traveled to israel – the first u.s. president to do so at a time of war – in the days after october to demonstrate that the united states stands with israel in its quest for peace and security. he has also defended israel at the u.n. against one-sided efforts to condemn israel. the administration worked with congressional leaders to pass a historic aid package worth $ billion to help israel defend itself and to provide more than $ billion for additional humanitarian aid to gaza. president biden has also been determined to broker an immediate and lasting ceasefire deal that once finalized secures the return of all hostages, including the remaining americans held in gaza; addresses the immense civilian pain and extreme suffering being caused by the conflict, including the displacement and death of so many innocent people in gaza; results in a durable end to the war in gaza; and sets the stage for a lasting regional peace. the president has made clear to the world the importance of this ceasefire and he and his team are working at the highest levels to finalize this deal. president biden has also worked tirelessly – including through the appointment of a senior civilian coordinator for humanitarian relief – to surge and ensure the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance to the palestinian people. many vulnerable civilians are suffering deadly consequences of the israel-hamas war. residents of gaza have been displaced, and food insecurity has been severe. the administration has worked relentlessly to deliver food, medicine, and other aid to the people of gaza and to set the conditions for the reconstruction of communities in gaza that have been devastated by the war. as president biden has made clear, a ceasefire deal will lead to a more secure israel and unlock the possibility of greater regional integration and historic normalization with its arab neighbors. it will allow israelis to safely return to their homes without fear of being attacked. a deal will also allow for arab nations and the international community to help rebuild gaza in a manner that does not allow hamas to re-arm. it will allow the united states to work with partners to rebuild homes, schools, and hospitals in gaza and repair destroyed communities. it would create the conditions for a better future for the palestinian people, one of self-determination, dignity, security, and freedom, and ultimately a state of their own – a contrast to trump, who refuses to endorse the political aspirations of the palestinian people. president biden and vice president harris oppose any unilateral steps by either side, including annexation, that undermine prospects for two states. we will continue to stand against incitement and terror. the administration opposes settlement expansion. president biden has spoken out against extremist settler violence, and in february, the president issued an executive order establishing u.s. authority to impose financial sanctions against foreign persons engaged in actions that threaten the peace, security, or stability of the west bank. the administration believes that while jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations, it should remain the capital of israel, an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths. we support critical assistance to the palestinian people in the west bank and gaza, consistent with u.s. law. the administration opposes any effort to unfairly single out and delegitimize israel, including at the united nations or through the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement, while protecting the constitutional right of our citizens to free speech. the lebanese people deserve to live in an independent and sovereign lebanon that is free from the grip of iran-backed hezbollah, and a corruption-free, competent, reform-minded government focused on addressing the needs of its people. in this regard, the administration is also committed to facilitating a diplomatic resolution to the ongoing hostilities along the israel-lebanon border that would ensure the return of both israeli and lebanese families to their homes. western hemisphere no region impacts the united states more directly than the western hemisphere. with $. trillion in annual trade, shared values and democratic traditions and family bonds, our partners in latin america and the caribbean are key contributors to u.s. prosperity and resiliency. the president is building coalitions across the region that make america safer and more prosperous. he knows that we must work in lockstep with our neighbors to ensure democracies deliver on the issues that matter most to all of us. in the last four years, president biden has strengthened ties with key allies across the hemisphere. he designated colombia as a major non-nato ally, a recognition of the close and unique relationship between the countries that will strengthen our military and economic ties. understanding that irregular migration affects every country in the hemisphere, president biden led the development of the los angeles declaration on migration and protection, a landmark agreement that strengthens cooperation on migration among countries and promotes responsibility-sharing and a more orderly and humane management of migration across the region. he and the vice president have created over , new jobs in honduras, el salvador and guatemala under the administration’s ambitious root causes strategy for central america. president biden also hosted the inaugural americas partnership for economic prosperity leaders’ summit to establish an enduring forum to mobilize economic investment for the region. and he has strengthened bonds with our closest neighbors, canada and mexico, on issues ranging from border security to trade. president biden is committed to countering corruption, authoritarianism, democratic backsliding, and violence in the region. he has continued to lay the groundwork for progress on u.s.-cuba relations in a manner that benefits americans, resuming flights between the two nations, reuniting separated families, and restoring diplomatic engagement on discrete issues like migration. and his administration has also played a critical role in supporting haiti’s stabilization efforts, becoming the largest financial sponsor to the kenyan multinational security support mission that is countering gang violence in the country and providing humanitarian aid. president biden is also supporting human rights and fundamental freedoms as people across the region pursue a more just and prosperous future. under president biden, the united states negotiated the release of ten american hostages from venezuela, reinstated sanctions on venezuela’s oil and gas sector in response to president nicolás maduro failing to commit to free and fair elections, and cracked down on nicaragua for repression of their population and abuse of migrants. in sharp contrast, the chaos of trump’s presidency threw our critical partnerships in the region into turmoil. he normalized autocratic leadership and failed to stand up for shared american values. in his second term, president biden will continue the work to ensure a secure border, protect u.s. jobs, and maintain stability in neighboring countries in order to keep americans safe and prosperous. africa by the end of the century, an estimated percent of the world’s population will live in africa. president biden has strengthened partnerships in the region and recognizes african nations’ critical role in global stability and economic development. in a historic move, the administration successfully advocated for the african union to become a permanent member of the g20, ensuring africa's voice in global economic discussions. and president biden's hosting of kenyan president ruto for a state visit, the first by an african head of state since , underscored the importance of the u.s.-kenya partnership, reflecting a broader strategy of strengthening bilateral ties across the continent grounded in mutual respect. the administration’s work with the continent is focused on advancing democratic governance, fostering sustainable economic growth, improving health outcomes, and addressing the urgent challenges of climate change. the u.s.-africa leaders summit in underscored how the united states and african nations are expanding partnerships to meet shared challenges. the president is committed to continuing work that will support american and african institutions and citizens as they respond to emerging opportunities and challenges in an increasingly urban and connected world. his pledge to invest $ billion over three years across africa is a reflection of that commitment. through initiatives like the african growth and opportunity act and prosper africa, the administration is deepening economic ties between african countries and the united states, advancing regional integration, and helping realize africa’s immense economic potential for our mutual benefit. president biden is committed to addressing development challenges and urgent humanitarian needs across the continent. the administration has invested and committed to provide nearly $ billion in health programs across africa. it has delivered over $ billion in emergency aid and food security assistance for resilient african food systems and supply markets. president biden has also launched a new strategic partnership on food security between the united states and the african union that will leverage the public and private sectors, along with multilateral development banks and international financial institutions to accelerate transformational investments in sustainable and resilient food systems to prevent food shocks before they happen. strengthening the capacity of african nations to address security threats, including terrorism and violent extremism, remains a top priority. the administration is expanding support for african-led peacekeeping operations and conflict resolution initiatives, ensuring that interventions align with the aspirations of local communities. president biden also places significant emphasis on human rights and the rule of law, leveraging diplomatic channels and development assistance to promote these values. he will continue to push for a return to democracy in cooperation with the african union in areas experiencing violence and instability, including sudan, where he named a special envoy to work towards ending the conflict. trump routinely ignored and disrespected the african continent, denigrating some nations as “shithole countries.” by giving up america’s moral authority in the region, he damaged america’s ability to collaboratively shape africa and the world’s future. in his second term, president biden will continue to build 21st century u.s.-african partnerships. he will also work to ensure that africa has a seat at the table in major global decisions by lobbying for united states security council reform that will secure permanent representation for africa. strengthening the u.s. and global economy president biden’s international economic policies promote growth, resilient supply chains, and clean energy adoption, while empowering american workers and workers everywhere. for too long, america’s trade policies and approach to the global economy let middle-class jobs move offshore, hollowed out our supply chains, rewarded corporate ceos instead of valuing workers, and failed to generate inclusive economic growth. in response to the previous status quo, president biden is committed to building a fairer, more durable global economic order, for the benefit of the american people and for people everywhere. under president biden, the united states is championing a modern industrial and innovation strategy, both domestically and with international partners. that strategy is focused on bolstering our economic and technological strengths, promoting diverse and resilient global supply chains, and setting high standards for labor, environmental practices, trusted technology, and good governance. it also aims to channel capital towards delivering public goods such as climate solutions and healthcare advancements. america’s prosperity and the prosperity of our allies and partners are mutually reinforcing. under president biden’s leadership, companies from american allies are building cutting-edge factories in the united states, employing hundreds of thousands of americans. u.s. partners provide critical materials, expertise, and products the world needs to achieve global climate goals, and are important markets for u.s. goods. trade with allies and partners on fair terms promotes growth and reinforces alliances. with the indo-pacific economic framework (ipef), the partnership for global infrastructure and investment, the americas partnership for economic prosperity, and bilateral initiatives such as the u.s.-kenya strategic trade and investment partnership, the united states will mobilize tens of billions of dollars to invest in clean energy development and critical infrastructure with high labor standards around the world. these investments will result in high-quality growth, increased supply chain resilience, and progress toward global climate goals. american strength at home and leadership in the world depends on america remaining at the forefront of technological innovation. president biden will work with governments, experts, and members of the private sector to ensure that artificial intelligence and other innovative technologies lead to progress without creating new national security risks and societal divisions. building on joint technology initiatives with the european union, india, singapore, south korea, and other partners, president biden will promote innovation and shared rules for global technologies. trump was the first president of the united states to leave office having fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president. unlike biden, whose targeted tariffs on china will promote u.s. growth, trump’s plan to increase taxes on imports from allies, like european cancer drugs and foods from mexico and latin america, will fall hard on american families. trump has consistently failed to help american workers because he has always put himself first. president biden has and always will put american workers first. in his second term, president biden will continue to invest in america and our allies and partners to grow the middle class globally. he will pursue modern industrial policies, make strategic public investments to fill in where markets cannot, work to secure our supply chains on critical technologies, and fight for a global minimum tax that ensures corporations pay their fair share. president biden will also continue to work with our allies and partners to protect labor and climate standards while helping america compete and win on the world stage. he will leverage economic tools and diplomatic partnerships and he will rally the world against economic coercion, utilizing mechanisms like the g7, world bank, and other multilateral institutions. leading with diplomacy and american values president biden has often said that the united states is strongest when we lead not only with the example of our power but with the power of our example. military force should be a tool of last resort, not the first. commitment to our values at home and abroad requires working alongside our allies and using every diplomatic tool available to advance american interests. it means investing in members of our civil and foreign service, who lead america’s engagement with the world and work in support of our shared prosperity and security in rapidly changing and increasingly complex environments. president biden ended america’s longest war, bringing our troops home from afghanistan and facilitating the resettlement of over , afghan partners and their families in the united states, the largest resettlement effort since the vietnam war. and in the wake of russia’s invasion of ukraine, the united states rallied the world to address a global food crisis and provided $ billion in global humanitarian assistance. president biden's leadership globally was clear in his response to the covid- pandemic among other global health challenges. between may and february the united states donated more than million vaccine doses to countries and economies. and the administration led the largest-ever replenishment of the global fund to fight hiv/aids, tb, and malaria, with donors pledging $. billion. understanding that there is nothing more important than addressing the climate crisis, president biden has kept his word and ensured that the united states leads the world to combat climate change. the record-breaking heat, floods, storms, drought, and wildfires devastating communities around the world underscore the grave risks we already face and the urgency needed to reduce emissions and to help the most vulnerable countries cope with devastating climate impacts. the united states rejoined the paris climate agreement on day one of his presidency, and president biden set an ambitious goal to reach net-zero emissions by , in line with climate science. and the administration is supporting investments in climate infrastructure that make tangible progress on climate mitigation and adaptation while also helping developing countries unlock economic growth in key areas. in response to the rise of authoritarianism across the globe, president biden convened two summits for democracy, bringing allies and partners together to strengthen democratic resilience, combat corruption, and promote human rights globally, including for lgbtqi+ persons. the third summit occurred this year under south korea’s leadership, and president biden is proud to have catalyzed this new global forum to support and coordinate democracies around the world, and which will continue in his second term. president biden believes the united states must continue to be a strong advocate for the rights and opportunities of women and girls around the world. under his leadership, the united states issued its first-ever national strategy on gender equity and equality, which recognizes that elevating the status of women and girls is not just the right thing to do – it is a strategic imperative that advances american interests in prosperity and stability. when women and girls are healthy, educated, and able to participate economically, their families and communities prosper, poverty decreases, and economies grow. and when women participate in conflict resolution and post-conflict processes, it improves the likelihood of securing sustainable peace. president biden will continue to support the united states strategy and national action plan on women, peace, and security and will continue to work to end the epidemic of gender-based violence around the world, including efforts to increase accountability for conflict-related sexual violence. his administration will continue prioritizing ratification of the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. president biden understands that advancing the rights of women and girls includes sexual and reproductive health and rights. his administration has prioritized women’s health by rescinding the global gag rule (mexico city policy), and supporting funding for the un population fund. trump's undermining of democratic institutions, attacks on the free press, and refusal to accept the results of the election weakened the global perception of american democracy, giving autocracies a pretext to dismiss democratic values and practices. these actions collectively eroded the united states' standing on the world stage. president biden will never turn our back on our alliances or fail to stand up for human rights and democracy around the world and at home. in his second term, he will support the critical work of our diplomats and continue to fight to bring americans detained abroad home. president biden will continue work to strengthen global health systems, bolster pandemic preparedness programs, and alleviate global food insecurity. he will expand on america’s track record of providing humanitarian assistance to those most in need including by resettling , refugees in , the most in three decades after trump nearly destroyed the u.s. refugee admissions program. president biden will also ensure the united states continues to drive multilateral efforts to reduce poverty, address unsustainable debt burdens and build a more inclusive and more fair global economy. he will continue to lead on efforts to combat the existential threat of climate change and support adaptation efforts in developing nations. and he will keep fighting corruption, supporting good governance, and countering terrorist threats around the world. strongest military in the world the united states has the finest fighting force in the history of the world. and while our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, coast guardsmen and guardians remain the envy of the globe, president biden understands that maintaining our military advantages in the future means making strategic investments now. that is why the administration has invested in cutting-edge capabilities across all services and domains and maintained a commitment to modernize and recapitalize the nuclear triad as the bedrock of deterrence. that is also why president biden has made historic investments in america’s military industrial base, putting billions of dollars to work in america to increase production capacity of critical munitions and other capabilities to support u.s. and allied forces in combat zones such as ukraine. and as the administration does the work to plan against dramatic changes in geopolitics, technology, economics, and the environment, our military has maintained its ability to address terrorist threats, evidenced by successful strikes against leaders of al-qa’ida and isis. properly investing in our military also means first and foremost investing in those who are the bedrock of it: our service members. president biden has secured pay raises for military personnel in recognition of their invaluable service. his administration has allocated over $ billion to enhance health care services for veterans and active-duty personnel, including expanded mental health resources and programs to support those suffering from ptsd and other service-related conditions. president biden’s consistent efforts to address military housing issues resulted in a $. billion investment in military housing improvements, leading to better living conditions and increased oversight of housing contracts. the administration's policies have also supported military spouses, with over $ million in funds dedicated to bolstering education and employment opportunities, underscoring the critical role that families play in the strength and resilience of the armed forces. aware of exacerbated nuclear proliferation challenges that the world is facing as russia, the prc and north korea expand and diversify their nuclear arsenals, and in the context of iran continuing to enrich uranium at dangerous levels, the administration is showing what it means to act responsibly as a nuclear power. nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. the united states is developing and fielding only what is required to deter while signaling openness to future arms control negotiations if competitors are interested. the administration is modernizing each leg of our nuclear triad, updating our command, control, and communication systems, and investing in our nuclear enterprise – to ensure that we can sustain and enhance if necessary capabilities and posture. president biden has reaffirmed in u.s. doctrine that u.s. nuclear weapons are reserved for deterring strategic attack by those that threaten us and our allies and partners with nuclear weapons. trump has never understood the values that our military swears to uphold. instead, he calls our service members “suckers” and “losers.” he can never make america great, because he does not understand the values represented by our military that already make us great. president biden has never and will never turn his back on our military. in his second term, he will continue to invest in upgrading to next-generation weapon systems, cutting-edge training opportunities, and deterrence capabilities such as our submarine force and the nuclear triad. he will continue to address cyber threats by bolstering the capacity of our intelligence communities and leading the development of rules of the road for technologies like artificial intelligence. and he will continue to always put our veterans and military families first by securing additional pay raises for service members, accessible and affordable childcare for our military families, good-paying job opportunities for military spouses, effective suicide and sexual assault prevention programs, and benefits for our veterans and their families.","['democratic', 'party', 'platform', 'democratic', 'national', 'convention', 'land', 'acknowledgement', 'democratic',

Republican Party,2024,2020,rep_2024.csv,CSV,"43 RD REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION THE 2024 REPUBLICAN PLATFORM MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN Dedication: To the Forgotten Men and Women of America PREAMBLE AMERICA FIRST: A RETURN TO COMMON SENSE Our Nation’s History is filled with the stories of brave men and women who gave everything they had to build America into the Greatest Nation in the History of the World. Generations of American Patriots have summoned the American Spirit of Strength, Determination, and Love of Country to overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges. The American People have proven time and again that we can overcome any obstacle and any force pitted against us. In the early days of our Republic, the Founding Generation defeated what was then the most powerful Empire the World had ever seen. In the 20th Century, America vanquished Nazism and Fascism, and then triumphed over Soviet Communism after forty-four years of the Cold War. But now we are a Nation in SERIOUS DECLINE. Our future, our identity, and our very way of life are under threat like never before. Today we must once again call upon the same American Spirit that led us to prevail through every challenge of the past if we are going to lead our Nation to a brighter future. For decades, our politicians sold our jobs and livelihoods to the highest bidders overseas with unfair Trade Deals and a blind faith in the siren song of globalism. They insulated themselves from criticism and the consequences of their own bad actions, allowing our Borders to be overrun, our cities to be overtaken by crime, our System of Justice to be weaponized, and our young people to develop a sense of hopelessness and despair. They rejected our History and our Values. Quite simply, they did everything in their power to destroy our Country. In 2016, President Donald J. Trump was elected as an unapologetic Champion of the American People. He reignited the American Spirit and called on us to renew our National Pride. His Policies spurred Historic Economic Growth, Job Creation, and a Resurgence of American Manufacturing. President Trump and the Republican Party led America out of the pessimism induced by decades of failed leadership, showing us that the American People want Greatness for our Country again. Yet after nearly four years of the Biden administration, America is now rocked by Raging Inflation, Open Borders, Rampant Crime, Attacks on our Children, and Global Conflict, Chaos, and Instability. Like the Heroes who built and defended this Nation before us, we will never give up. We will restore our Nation of, by, and for the People. We will Make America Great Again. We will be a Nation based on Truth, Justice, and Common Sense. AMERICA FIRST: A RETURN TO COMMON SENSE Common Sense tells us clearly, in President Trump’s words, that “If we don’t have a Border, we don’t have a Country.” Restoring sensible Border Security and Immigration Policy requires many steps, all of which would have been and indeed were taken for granted by prior Generations as obviously necessary and good. We must secure our Southern Border by completing the Border Wall that President Trump started. Hundreds of miles have already been built and work magnificently. The remaining Wall construction can be completed quickly, effectively, and inexpensively. We must also vigilantly check those who enter our Country by other routes and ensure that no one can enter our Country who does not have the Legal Right to do so, and we must deport the millions of illegal Migrants who Joe Biden has deliberately encouraged to invade our Country. We will start by prioritizing the most dangerous criminals and working with local Police. We must not allow Biden’s Migrant Invasion to alter our Country. It must not stand. Under the Trump Administration and a Republican Congress, it will be defeated immediately. Common Sense tells us clearly that if we don’t have Domestic Manufacturing with low Inflation, not only will our Economy —and even our Military Equipment and Supplies—be at the mercy of Foreign Nations, but our Towns, Communities, and People cannot thrive. The Republican Party must return to its roots as the Party of Industry, Manufacturing, Infrastructure, and Workers. President Trump’s economic policy to end Inflation and return Manufacturing Jobs is not only what the American Economy and American Workers need right now, it is also what they want right now. Common Sense tells us clearly that we must unleash American Energy if we want to destroy Inflation and rapidly bring down prices, build the Greatest Economy in History, revive our Defense Industrial Base, fuel Emerging Industries, and establish the United States as the Manufacturing Superpower of the World. We will DRILL, BABY, DRILL and we will become Energy Independent, and even Dominant again. The United States has more liquid gold under our feet than any other Nation, and it’s not even close. The Republican Party will harness that potential to power our future. Common Sense tells us clearly that if we don’t have a Strong Military, we won’t be able to defend our interests and we will be at the mercy of Hostile Nations. The Policy of the Republican Party must be to ensure that America’s Military is the strongest and best-equipped in the World —and that our Government uses that great strength sparingly, and only in clear instances where our National Interests are threatened. Common Sense tells us clearly that the Republican Party must stand for Equal Treatment for All. Likewise, the Republican Party must ensure the equal application of law to all regardless of political affiliation or personal beliefs. Recent Democrat-led political persecutions threaten to destroy 250 years of American Principle and Practice and must be stopped. AMERICA FIRST: A RETURN TO COMMON SENSE America needs determined Republican Leadership at every level of Government to address the core threats to our very survival: Our disastrously Open Border, our weakened Economy, crippling restrictions on American Energy Production, our depleted Military, attacks on the American System of Justice, and much more. To make clear our commitment, we offer to the American people the 2024 GOP Platform to Make America Great Again! It is a forward-looking Agenda that begins with the following twenty promises that we will accomplish very quickly when we win the White House and Republican Majorities in the House and Senate. 1 SEAL THE BORDER, AND STOP THE MIGRANT INVASION 2 CARRY OUT THE LARGEST DEPORTATION OPERATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY 3 END INFLATION, AND MAKE AMERICA AFFORDABLE AGAIN 4 MAKE AMERICA THE DOMINANT ENERGY PRODUCER IN THE WORLD, BY FAR! 5 STOP OUTSOURCING, AND TURN THE UNITED STATES INTO A MANUFACTURING SUPERPOWER 6 LARGE TAX CUTS FOR WORKERS, AND NO TAX ON TIPS! 7 DEFEND OUR CONSTITUTION, OUR BILL OF RIGHTS, AND OUR FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS, INCLUDING FREEDOM OF SPEECH, FREEDOM OF RELIGION, AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS 8 PREVENT WORLD WAR THREE , RESTORE PEACE IN EUROPE AND IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AND BUILD A GREAT IRON DOME MISSILE DEFENSE SHIELD OVER OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY -- ALL MADE IN AMERICA 9 END THE WEAPONIZATION OF GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 10 STOP THE MIGRANT CRIME EPIDEMIC, DEMOLISH THE FOREIGN DRUG CARTELS, CRUSH GANG VIOLENCE, AND LOCK UP VIOLENT OFFENDERS 11 REBUILD OUR CITIES, INCLUDING WASHINGTON DC, MAKING THEM SAFE, CLEAN, AND BEAUTIFUL AGAIN 12 STRENGTHEN AND MODERNIZE OUR MILITARY, MAKING IT, WITHOUT QUESTION, THE STRONGEST AND MOST POWERFUL IN THE WORLD 13 KEEP THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THE WORLD’S RESERVE CURRENCY 14 FIGHT FOR AND PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE WITH NO CUTS, INCLUDING NO CHANGES TO THE RETIREMENT AGE 15 CANCEL THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANDATE AND CUT COSTLY AND BURDENSOME REGULATIONS 16 CUT FEDERAL FUNDING FOR ANY SCHOOL PUSHING CRITICAL RACE THEORY, RADICAL GENDER IDEOLOGY, AND OTHER INAPPROPRIATE RACIAL, SEXUAL, OR POLITICAL CONTENT ON OUR CHILDREN 17 KEEP MEN OUT OF WOMEN’S SPORTS 18 DEPORT PRO-HAMAS RADICALS AND MAKE OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES SAFE AND PATRIOTIC AGAIN 19 SECURE OUR ELECTIONS, INCLUDING SAME DAY VOTING, VOTER IDENTIFICATION, PAPER BALLOTS, AND PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP 20 UNITE OUR COUNTRY BY BRINGING IT TO NEW AND RECORD LEVELS OF SUCCESS When America is united, confident, and committed to our principles, it will never fail.

CHAPTER ONE DEFEAT INFLATION, AND QUICKLY BRING DOWN ALL PRICES Our Commitment: The Republican Party will reverse the worst Inflation crisis in four decades that has crushed the middle class, devastated family budgets, and pushed the dream of homeownership out of reach for millions. We will defeat Inflation, tackle the cost-of-living crisis, improve fiscal sanity, restore price stability, and quickly bring down prices. Inflation is a crushing tax on American families. History shows that Inflation will not magically disappear while policies remain the same. We commit to unleashing American Energy, reining in wasteful spending, cutting excessive Regulations, securing our Borders, and restoring Peace through Strength. Together, we will restore Prosperity, ensure Economic Security, and build a brighter future for American Workers and their families. Our dedication to these Policies will make America stronger, more resilient, and more prosperous than ever before. 1. Unleash American Energy Under President Trump, the U.S. became the Number One Producer of Oil and Natural Gas in the World — and we will soon be again by lifting restrictions on American Energy Production and terminating the Socialist Green New Deal. Republicans will unleash Energy Production from all sources, including nuclear, to immediately slash Inflation and power American homes, cars, and factories with reliable, abundant, and affordable Energy. 2. Rein in Wasteful Federal Spending Republicans will immediately stabilize the Economy by slashing wasteful Government spending and promoting Economic Growth. 3. Cut Costly and Burdensome Regulations Republicans will reinstate President Trump’s Deregulation Policies, which saved Americans $11,000 per household, and end Democrats’ regulatory onslaught that disproportionately harms low and middle-income households. 4. Stop Illegal Immigration Republicans will secure the Border, deport Illegal Aliens, and reverse the Democrats’ Open Borders Policies that have driven up the cost of Housing, Education, and Healthcare for American families. 5. Restore Peace through Strength War breeds Inflation while geopolitical stability brings price stability. Republicans will end the global chaos and restore Peace through Strength, reducing geopolitical risks and lowering commodity prices. CHAPTER TWO SEAL THE BORDER, AND STOP THE MIGRANT INVASION Our Commitment: Republicans offer an aggressive plan to stop the open-border policies that have opened the floodgates to a tidal wave of illegal Aliens, deadly drugs, and Migrant Crime. We will end the Invasion at the Southern Border, restore Law and Order, protect American Sovereignty, and deliver a Safe and Prosperous Future for all Americans. 1. Secure the Border Republicans will restore every Border Policy of the Trump administration and halt all releases of Illegal Aliens into the interior. We will complete the Border Wall, shift massive portions of Federal Law Enforcement to Immigration Enforcement, and use advanced technology to monitor and secure the Border. We will use all resources needed to stop the Invasion—including moving thousands of Troops currently stationed overseas to our own Southern Border. We will deploy the U.S. Navy to impose a full Fentanyl Blockade on the waters of our Region—boarding and inspecting ships to look for fentanyl and fentanyl precursors. Before we defend the Borders of Foreign Countries, we must first secure the Border of our Country. 2. Enforce Immigration Laws Republicans will strengthen ICE, increase penalties for illegal entry and overstaying Visas, and reinstate “Remain in Mexico” and other Policies that helped reduce Illegal Immigration to historic lows in President Trump’s first term. We will also invoke the Alien Enemies Act to remove all known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States, ending the scourge of Illegal Alien gang violence once and for all. We will bring back the Travel Ban, and use Title 42 to end the child trafficking crisis by returning all trafficked children to their families in their Home Countries immediately. 3. Begin Largest Deportation Program in American History President Trump and Republicans will reverse the Democrats’ destructive Open Borders Policies that have allowed criminal gangs and Illegal Aliens from around the World to roam the United States without consequences. The Republican Party is committed to sending Illegal Aliens back home and removing those who have violated our Laws. 4. Strict Vetting Republicans will use existing Federal Law to keep foreign Christian-hating Communists, Marxists, and Socialists out of America. Those who join our Country must love our Country. We will use extreme vetting to ensure that jihadists and jihadist sympathizers are not admitted. 5. Stop Sanctuary Cities Republicans will cut federal Funding to sanctuary jurisdictions that release dangerous Illegal Alien criminals onto our streets, rather than handing them over to ICE. We will require local cooperation with Federal Immigration Enforcement. 6. Ensure Our Legal Immigration System Puts American Workers First Republicans will prioritize Merit-based immigration, ensuring those admitted to our Country contribute positively to our Society and Economy, and never become a drain on Public Resources. We will end Chain Migration, and put American Workers first! CHAPTER THREE BUILD THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN HISTORY Our Commitment: American Workers are the most productive, talented, and innovative on Earth. The only thing holding them back is the suffocating policies of the Democrat Party. Our America First Economic Agenda rests on five pillars: Slashing Regulations, cutting Taxes, securing Fair Trade Deals, ensuring Reliable and Abundant Low Cost Energy, and championing Innovation. Together, we will restore Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for all Americans. 1. Cut Regulations Republicans will slash Regulations that stifle Jobs, Freedom, Innovation and make everything more expensive. We will implement Transparency and Common Sense in rulemaking. 2. Make Trump Tax Cuts Permanent and No Tax on Tips Republicans will make permanent the provisions of the Trump Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that doubled the standard deduction, expanded the Child Tax Credit, and spurred Economic Growth for all Americans. We will eliminate Taxes on Tips for millions of Restaurant and Hospitality Workers, and pursue additional Tax Cuts. 3. Fair and Reciprocal Trade Deals Republicans will continue forging an America First Trade Policy as set forth in Chapter 5, standing up to Countries that cheat and prioritizing American Producers over Foreign Outsourcers. We will bring our critical Supply Chains back home. President Trump will turn American Trade Policy around, protecting U.S. Producers, and renegotiating failed agreements. 4. Reliable and Abundant Low Cost Energy Republicans will increase Energy Production across the board, streamline the permitting process, and end market-distorting restrictions on Oil, Natural Gas, and Coal. The Republican Party will once again make America Energy Independent, and then Energy Dominant, lowering Energy prices even below the record lows achieved during President Trump’s first term. 5. Champion Innovation Republicans will pave the way for future Economic Greatness by leading the World in Emerging Industries. Crypto Republicans will end Democrats’ unlawful and unAmerican Crypto crackdown and oppose the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency. We will defend the right to mine Bitcoin, and ensure every American has the right to self-custody of their Digital Assets, and transact free from Government Surveillance and Control. Artificial Intelligence (AI) We will repeal Joe Biden’s dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI Innovation, and imposes Radical Leftwing ideas on the development of this technology. In its place, Republicans support AI Development rooted in Free Speech and Human Flourishing. Expanding Freedom, Prosperity and Safety in Space Under Republican Leadership, the United States will create a robust Manufacturing Industry in Near Earth Orbit, send American Astronauts back to the Moon, and onward to Mars, and enhance partnerships with the rapidly expanding Commercial Space sector to revolutionize our ability to access, live in, and develop assets in Space. CHAPTER FOUR BRING BACK THE AMERICAN DREAM AND MAKE IT AFFORDABLE AGAIN FOR FAMILIES, YOUNG PEOPLE, AND EVERYONE Our Commitment: Republicans offer a plan to make the American Dream affordable again. We commit to reducing Housing, Education, and Healthcare costs, while lowering everyday expenses, and increasing opportunities. 1. Housing Affordability To help new home buyers, Republicans will reduce mortgage rates by slashing Inflation, open limited portions of Federal Lands to allow for new home construction, promote homeownership through Tax Incentives and support for first-time buyers, and cut unnecessary Regulations that raise housing costs. 2. Accessible Higher Education To reduce the cost of Higher Education, Republicans will support the creation of additional, drastically more affordable alternatives to a traditional four-year College degree. 3. Affordable Healthcare Healthcare and prescription drug costs are out of control. Republicans will increase Transparency, promote Choice and Competition, and expand access to new Affordable Healthcare and prescription drug options. We will protect Medicare, and ensure Seniors receive the care they need without being burdened by excessive costs. 4. Lower Everyday Costs Republicans will reduce the Regulatory burden, lower Energy costs, and promote Economic Policies that drive down the cost of living and prices for everyday goods and services. CHAPTER FIVE PROTECT AMERICAN WORKERS AND FARMERS FROM UNFAIR TRADE Our Commitment: The Republican Party stands for a patriotic “America First” Economic Policy. Republicans offer a robust plan to protect American Workers, Farmers, and Industries from unfair Foreign Competition. We commit to rebalancing Trade, securing Strategic Independence, and revitalizing Manufacturing. We will prioritize Domestic Production, and ensure National Independence in essential goods and services. Together, we will build a Strong, Self-reliant, and Prosperous America. 1. Rebalance Trade Our Trade deficit in goods has grown to over $1 Trillion Dollars a year. Republicans will support baseline Tariffs on Foreign-made goods, pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act, and respond to unfair Trading practices. As Tariffs on Foreign Producers go up, Taxes on American Workers, Families, and Businesses can come down. 2. Secure Strategic Independence from China Republicans will revoke China’s Most Favored Nation status, phase out imports of essential goods, and stop China from buying American Real Estate and Industries. 3. Save the American Auto Industry Republicans will revive the U.S. Auto Industry by reversing harmful Regulations, canceling Biden’s Electric Vehicle and other Mandates, and preventing the importation of Chinese vehicles. 4. Bring Home Critical Supply Chains Republicans will bring critical Supply Chains back to the U.S., ensuring National Security and Economic Stability, while also creating Jobs and raising Wages for American Workers. 5. Buy American and Hire American Republicans will strengthen Buy American and Hire American Policies, banning companies that outsource jobs from doing business with the Federal Government. 6. Become the Manufacturing Superpower By protecting American Workers from unfair Foreign Competition and unleashing American Energy, Republicans will restore American Manufacturing, creating Jobs, Wealth, and Investment. CHAPTER SIX PROTECT SENIORS Our Commitment: President Trump has made absolutely clear that he will not cut one penny from Medicare or Social Security. American Citizens work hard their whole lives, contributing to Social Security and Medicare. These programs are promises to our Seniors, ensuring they can live their golden years with dignity. Republicans will protect these vital programs and ensure Economic Stability. We will work with our Great Seniors, in order to allow them to be active and healthy. We commit to safeguarding the future for our Seniors and all American families. 1. Protect Social Security Social Security is a lifeline for millions of Retirees, yet corrupt politicians have robbed Social Security to fund their pet projects. Republicans will restore Economic Stability to ensure the long-term sustainability of Social Security. 2. Strengthen Medicare Republicans will protect Medicare’s finances from being financially crushed by the Democrat plan to add tens of millions of new illegal immigrants to the rolls of Medicare. We vow to strengthen Medicare for future generations. 3. Support Active and Healthy Living Republicans will support increased focus on Chronic Disease prevention and management, Long-Term Care, and Benefit flexibility. We will expand access to Primary Care and support Policies that help Seniors remain in their homes and maintain Financial Security. 4. Protect Care at Home for the Elderly Republicans will shift resources back to at-home Senior Care, overturn disincentives that lead to Care Worker shortages, and support unpaid Family Caregivers through Tax Credits and reduced red tape. 5. Protect Economic Foundations for Supporting Seniors Republicans will tackle Inflation, unleash American Energy, restore Economic Growth, and secure our Borders to preserve Social Security and Medicare funding for the next Generation and beyond. We will ensure these programs remain solvent long into the future by reversing harmful Democrat policies and unleashing a new Economic Boom. CHAPTER SEVEN CULTIVATE GREAT K-12 SCHOOLS LEADING TO GREAT JOBS AND GREAT LIVES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE Our Commitment: Republicans offer a plan to cultivate great K-12 schools, ensure safe learning environments free from political meddling, and restore Parental Rights. We commit to an Education System that empowers students, supports families, and promotes American Values. Our Education System must prepare students for successful lives and well-paying jobs. 1. Great Principals and Great Teachers Republicans will support schools that focus on Excellence and Parental Rights. We will support ending Teacher Tenure, adopting Merit pay, and allowing various publicly supported Educational models. 2. Universal School Choice Republicans believe families should be empowered to choose the best Education for their children. We support Universal School Choice in every State in America. We will expand 529 Education Savings Accounts and support Homeschooling Families equally. 3. Prepare Students for Jobs and Careers Republicans will emphasize Education to prepare students for great jobs and careers, supporting project-based learning and schools that offer meaningful work experience. We will expose politicized education models and fund proven career training programs. 4. Safe, Secure, and Drug-Free Schools Republicans will support overhauling standards on school discipline, advocate for immediate suspension of violent students, and support hardening schools to help keep violence away from our places of learning. 5. Restore Parental Rights Republicans will restore Parental Rights in Education, and enforce our Civil Rights Laws to stop schools from discriminating on the basis of Race. We trust Parents! 6. Knowledge and Skills, Not CRT and Gender Indoctrination Republicans will ensure children are taught fundamentals like Reading, History, Science, and Math, not Leftwing propaganda. We will defund schools that engage in inappropriate political indoctrination of our children using Federal Taxpayer Dollars. 7. Promote Love of Country with Authentic Civics Education Republicans will reinstate the 1776 Commission, promote Fair and Patriotic Civics Education, and veto efforts to nationalize Civics Education. We will support schools that teach America’s Founding Principles and Western Civilization. 8. Freedom to Pray Republicans will champion the First Amendment Right to Pray and Read the Bible in school, and stand up to those who violate the Religious Freedoms of American students. 9. Return Education to the States The United States spends more money per pupil on Education than any other Country in the World, and yet we are at the bottom of every educational list in terms of results. We are going to close the Department of Education in Washington, D.C. and send it back to the States, where it belongs, and let the States run our educational system as it should be run. Our Great Teachers, who are so important to the future wellbeing of our Country, will be cherished and protected by the Republican Party so that they can do the job of educating our students that they so dearly want to do. It is our goal to bring Education in the United States to the highest level, one that it has never attained before! CHAPTER EIGHT BRING COMMON SENSE TO GOVERNMENT AND RENEW THE PILLARS OF AMERICAN CIVILIZATION Our Commitment: Republicans offer a plan to renew American Civilization with Common Sense Policies that supports families, restores Law and Order, cares for Veterans, promotes beauty, and honors American History. We commit to strengthening the Foundations of our Society for a brighter future. 1. Empower American Families Republicans will promote a Culture that values the Sanctity of Marriage, the blessings of childhood, the foundational role of families, and supports working parents. We will end policies that punish families. 2. Rebuild Our Cities and Restore Law and Order Republicans will restore safety in our neighborhoods by replenishing Police Departments, restoring Common Sense Policing, and protecting Officers from frivolous lawsuits. We will stand up to Marxist Prosecutors, vigorously defend the Right of every American to live in peace, and we will compassionately address homelessness to restore order to our streets. 3. Make Washington D.C. the Safest and Most Beautiful Capital City Republicans will reassert greater Federal Control over Washington, DC to restore Law and Order in our Capital City, and ensure Federal Buildings and Monuments are well-maintained. 4. Take Care of Our Veterans Republicans will end luxury housing and Taxpayer benefits for Illegal Immigrants and use those savings to shelter and treat homeless Veterans. We will restore Trump Administration reforms to expand Veterans’ Healthcare Choices, protect Whistleblowers, and hold accountable poorly performing employees not giving our Veterans the care they deserve. 5. Make Colleges and Universities Sane and Affordable Republicans will fire Radical Left accreditors, drive down Tuition costs, restore Due Process protections, and pursue Civil Rights cases against Schools that discriminate. 6. Combat Antisemitism Republicans condemn antisemitism, and support revoking Visas of Foreign Nationals who support terrorism and jihadism.

Restore American Beauty Republicans will promote beauty in Public Architecture and preserve our Natural Treasures. We will build cherished symbols of our Nation, and restore genuine Conservation efforts. 9. Honor American History Republicans celebrate our Great American Heroes and are proud that the Story of America makes everyone free. We will organize a National Celebration to mark the 250th Anniversary of the Founding of the United States of America. CHAPTER NINE GOVERNMENT OF, BY, AND FOR THE PEOPLE Our Commitment: Republicans will offer a clear, precise, and USA oriented plan to stop the Radical Left Democrats’ Weaponization of Government and its Assault on American Liberty. We will restore Government of, by, and for the People, ensuring Accountability, protecting Individual Liberties, and fixing our once very corrupt Elections. We commit to upholding the Constitution of the United States, appointing judges who respect the rule of law, and defending the Rights of all Americans to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. We will maintain the Supreme Court as it was always meant to be, at 9 Justices. We will not allow the Democrat Party to increase this number, as they would like to do, by 4, 6, 8, 10, and even 12 Justices. We will block them at every turn. 1. Republicans Will Stop Woke and Weaponized Government We will hold accountable those who have misused the power of Government to unjustly prosecute their Political Opponents. We will declassify Government records, root out wrongdoers, and fire corrupt employees. 2. Republicans Will Dismantle Censorship & Protect Free Speech We will ban the Federal Government from colluding with anyone to censor Lawful Speech, defund institutions engaged in censorship, and hold accountable all bureaucrats involved with illegal censoring. We will protect Free Speech online. 3. Republicans Will Defend Religious Liberty We are the defenders of the First Amendment Right to Religious Liberty. It protects the Right not only to Worship according to the dictates of Conscience, but also to act in accordance with those Beliefs, not just in places of Worship, but in everyday life. Our ranks include men and women from every Faith and Tradition, and we respect the Right of every American to follow his or her deeply held Beliefs. To protect Religious Liberty, Republicans support a new Federal Task Force on Fighting Anti-Christian Bias that will investigate all forms of illegal discrimination, harassment, and persecution against Christians in America. 4. Republicans Will Protect and Defend a Vote of the People, from within the States, on the Issue of Life We proudly stand for families and Life. We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights. After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the States and to a vote of the People. We will oppose Late Term Abortion, while supporting mothers and policies that advance Prenatal Care, access to Birth Control, and IVF (fertility treatments). 5.

We will not allow the Democrats to give Voting Rights to illegal Aliens. 7. Republicans Will Protect Americans in the Territories. The territories of Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico are of vital importance to our National Security, and we welcome their greater participation in all aspects of the political process. CHAPTER TEN RETURN TO PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH Our Commitment: Keeping the American People safe requires a strong America. The Biden administration’s weak Foreign Policy has made us less safe and a laughingstock all over the World. The Republican Plan is to return Peace through Strength, rebuilding our Military and Alliances, countering China, defeating terrorism, building an Iron Dome Missile Defense Shield, promoting American Values, securing our Homeland and Borders, and reviving our Defense Industrial Base. We will build a Military bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. Our full commitment is to protecting America and ensuring a safe and prosperous future for all. 1. The National Interest Republicans will promote a Foreign Policy centered on the most essential American Interests, starting with protecting the American Homeland, our People, our Borders, our Great American Flag, and our Rights under God. 2. Modernize the Military Republicans will ensure our Military is the most modern, lethal, and powerful Force in the World. We will invest in cutting-edge research and advanced technologies, including an Iron Dome Missile Defense Shield, support our Troops with higher pay, and get woke Leftwing Democrats fired as soon as possible. 3. Strengthen Alliances Republicans will strengthen Alliances by ensuring that our Allies must meet their obligations to invest in our Common Defense and by restoring Peace to Europe. We will stand with Israel, and seek peace in the Middle East. We will rebuild our Alliance Network in the Region to ensure a future of Peace, Stability, and Prosperity. Likewise, we will champion Strong, Sovereign, and Independent Nations in the Indo-Pacific, thriving in Peace and Commerce with others. 4. Strengthen Economic, Military, and Diplomatic Capabilities Republicans will strengthen Economic, Military, and Diplomatic capabilities to protect the American way of life from the malign influences of Countries that stand against us around the World. 5. Defend America’s Borders Against all odds, President Trump has completed Hundreds of Miles of Wall, and he will quickly finish the job. Republicans will mobilize Military personnel and assets as necessary to crack down hard on the cartels that traffic drugs and people into our Country. 6. Revive our Industrial Base Our Industrial Base is critical to ensuring good jobs for our people but also the reliable production of vital Defense platforms and supplies. Our Policy must be to revive our Industrial Base, with priority on Defense-critical industries. Equipment and parts critical to American Security must be MADE IN THE USA. 7. Protect Critical Infrastructure Republicans will use all tools of National Power to protect our Nation’s Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Base from malicious cyber actors. This will be a National Priority, and we will both raise the Security Standards for our Critical Systems and Networks and defend them against bad actors.",35258,5409,"rd republican national convention the republican platform make america great again dedication: to the forgotten men and women of america preamble america first: a return to common sense our nation’s history is filled with the stories of brave men and women who gave everything they had to build america into the greatest nation in the history of the world. generations of american patriots have summoned the american spirit of strength, determination, and love of country to overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges. the american people have proven time and again that we can overcome any obstacle and any force pitted against us. in the early days of our republic, the founding generation defeated what was then the most powerful empire the world had ever seen. in the 20th century, america vanquished nazism and fascism, and then triumphed over soviet communism after forty-four years of the cold war. but now we are a nation in serious decline. our future, our identity, and our very way of life are under threat like never before. today we must once again call upon the same american spirit that led us to prevail through every challenge of the past if we are going to lead our nation to a brighter future. for decades, our politicians sold our jobs and livelihoods to the highest bidders overseas with unfair trade deals and a blind faith in the siren song of globalism. they insulated themselves from criticism and the consequences of their own bad actions, allowing our borders to be overrun, our cities to be overtaken by crime, our system of justice to be weaponized, and our young people to develop a sense of hopelessness and despair. they rejected our history and our values. quite simply, they did everything in their power to destroy our country. in , president donald j. trump was elected as an unapologetic champion of the american people. he reignited the american spirit and called on us to renew our national pride. his policies spurred historic economic growth, job creation, and a resurgence of american manufacturing. president trump and the republican party led america out of the pessimism induced by decades of failed leadership, showing us that the american people want greatness for our country again. yet after nearly four years of the biden administration, america is now rocked by raging inflation, open borders, rampant crime, attacks on our children, and global conflict, chaos, and instability. like the heroes who built and defended this nation before us, we will never give up. we will restore our nation of, by, and for the people. we will make america great again. we will be a nation based on truth, justice, and common sense. america first: a return to common sense common sense tells us clearly, in president trump’s words, that “if we don’t have a border, we don’t have a country.” restoring sensible border security and immigration policy requires many steps, all of which would have been and indeed were taken for granted by prior generations as obviously necessary and good. we must secure our southern border by completing the border wall that president trump started. hundreds of miles have already been built and work magnificently. the remaining wall construction can be completed quickly, effectively, and inexpensively. we must also vigilantly check those who enter our country by other routes and ensure that no one can enter our country who does not have the legal right to do so, and we must deport the millions of illegal migrants who joe biden has deliberately encouraged to invade our country. we will start by prioritizing the most dangerous criminals and working with local police. we must not allow biden’s migrant invasion to alter our country. it must not stand. under the trump administration and a republican congress, it will be defeated immediately. common sense tells us clearly that if we don’t have domestic manufacturing with low inflation, not only will our economy —and even our military equipment and supplies—be at the mercy of foreign nations, but our towns, communities, and people cannot thrive. the republican party must return to its roots as the party of industry, manufacturing, infrastructure, and workers. president trump’s economic policy to end inflation and return manufacturing jobs is not only what the american economy and american workers need right now, it is also what they want right now. common sense tells us clearly that we must unleash american energy if we want to destroy inflation and rapidly bring down prices, build the greatest economy in history, revive our defense industrial base, fuel emerging industries, and establish the united states as the manufacturing superpower of the world. we will drill, baby, drill and we will become energy independent, and even dominant again. the united states has more liquid gold under our feet than any other nation, and it’s not even close. the republican party will harness that potential to power our future. common sense tells us clearly that if we don’t have a strong military, we won’t be able to defend our interests and we will be at the mercy of hostile nations. the policy of the republican party must be to ensure that america’s military is the strongest and best-equipped in the world —and that our government uses that great strength sparingly, and only in clear instances where our national interests are threatened. common sense tells us clearly that the republican party must stand for equal treatment for all. likewise, the republican party must ensure the equal application of law to all regardless of political affiliation or personal beliefs. recent democrat-led political persecutions threaten to destroy years of american principle and practice and must be stopped. america first: a return to common sense america needs determined republican leadership at every level of government to address the core threats to our very survival: our disastrously open border, our weakened economy, crippling restrictions on american energy production, our depleted military, attacks on the american system of justice, and much more. to make clear our commitment, we offer to the american people the gop platform to make america great again! it is a forward-looking agenda that begins with the following twenty promises that we will accomplish very quickly when we win the white house and republican majorities in the house and senate. seal the border, and stop the migrant invasion carry out the largest deportation operation in american history end inflation, and make america affordable again make

record levels of success when america is united, confident, and committed to our principles, it will never fail. today and together, with love for our country, faith in our people, and trust in god’s

peace through strength. chapter one defeat inflation, and quickly bring down all prices our commitment: the republican party will reverse the worst inflation crisis in four decades that has crushed the middle class, devastated family budgets, and pushed the dream of homeownership out of reach for millions. we will defeat inflation, tackle the cost-of-living crisis, improve fiscal sanity, restore price stability, and quickly bring down prices. inflation is a crushing tax on american families. history shows that inflation will not magically disappear while policies remain the same. we commit to unleashing american energy, reining in wasteful spending, cutting excessive regulations, securing our borders, and restoring peace through strength. together, we will restore prosperity, ensure economic security, and build a brighter future for american workers and their families. our dedication to these policies will make america stronger, more resilient, and more prosperous than ever
