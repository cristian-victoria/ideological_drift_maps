Republican Party,1960,1960,rep_1960.csv,CSV,"PREAMBLE The United States is living in an age of profoundest revolution. The lives of men and of nations are undergoing such transformations as history has rarely recorded. The birth of new nations, the impact of new machines, the threat of new weapons, the stirring of new ideas, the ascent into a new dimension of the universe, everywhere the accent falls on the new. At such a time of world upheaval, great perils match great opportunities and hopes, as well as fears, rise in all areas of human life. Such a force as nuclear power symbolizes the greatness of the choice before the United States and mankind. The energy of the atom could bring devastation to humanity. Or it could be made to serve men's hopes for peace and progress to make for all peoples a more healthy and secure and prosperous life than man has ever known. One fact darkens the reasonable hopes of free men, the growing vigor and thrust of Communist imperialism. Everywhere across the earth, this force challenges us to prove our strength and wisdom, our capacity for sacrifice, our faith in ourselves and in our institutions. Free men look to us for leadership and support which we dedicate ourselves to give out of the abundance of our national strength. The fate of the world will be deeply affected, perhaps determined, by the quality of American leadership. American leadership means both how we govern ourselves and how we help to influence others. We deliberate the choice of national leadership and policy, mindful that in some measure our proposals involve the fate of mankind. The leadership of the United States must be responsible and mature its promises must be rational and practical, soberly pledged and faithfully undertaken. Its purposes and its aspirations must ascend to that high ground of right and freedom upon which mankind may dwell and progress in decent security. We are impressed, but not dismayed, by the revolutionary turbulence that is wracking the world. In the midst of violence and change, we draw strength and confidence from the changeless principles of our free Constitution. Free men are invincible when the power and courage, the patience and the fortitude latent in them are drawn forth by reasonable appeal. In this Republican Platform we offer to the United States our program, our call to service, our pledge of leadership, our proposal of measures in the public interest. We call upon God, in whose hand is every blessing, to favor our deliberations with wisdom, our nation with endurance, and troubled mankind everywhere with a righteous peace. FOREIGN POLICY The Republican Party asserts that the sovereign purpose of our foreign policy is to secure the free institutions of our nation against every peril, to hearten and fortify the love of freedom everywhere in the world, and to achieve a just peace for all of anxious humanity. The pre-eminence of this Republic requires of us a vigorous, resolute foreign policy, inflexible against every tyrannical encroachment, and mighty in its advance toward our own affirmative goals. The Government of the United States under the administration of President Eisenhower and Vice President Nixon has demonstrated that firmness in the face of threatened aggression is the most dependable safeguard of peace. We now reaffirm our determination to defend the security and the freedom of our country, to honor our commitments to our allies at whatever cost or sacrifice, and never to submit to force or threats. Our determination to stand fast has forestalled aggression before Berlin, in the Formosa Straits, and in Lebanon. Since 1954 no free nation has fallen victim behind the Iron Curtain. We mean to adhere to the policy of firmness that has served us so well. We are unalterably committed to maintaining the security, freedom and solidarity of the Western Hemisphere. We support President Eisenhower's reaffirmation of the Monroe Doctrine in all its vitality. Faithful to our treaty commitments, we shall join the Republics of the Americas against any intervention in our hemisphere, and in refusing to tolerate the establishment in this hemisphere of any government dominated by the foreign rule of communism. In the Middle East, we shall continue to support the integrity and independence of all the states of that area including Israel and the Arab States. With specific reference to Israel and the Arab Nations we urge them to undertake negotiations for a mutually acceptable settlement of the causes of tension between them. We pledge continued efforts: To eliminate the obstacles to a lasting peace in the area, including the human problem of the Arab refugees. To seek an end to transit and trade restrictions, blockades and boycotts. To secure freedom of navigation in international waterways, the cessation of discrimination against Americans on the basis of religious beliefs, and an end to the wasteful and dangerous arms race and to the threat of an arms imbalance in the area. Recognition of Communist China and its admission to the United Nations have been firmly opposed by the Republican Administration. We will continue in this opposition because of compelling evidence that to do otherwise would weaken the cause of freedom and endanger the future of the free peoples of Asia and the world. The brutal suppression of the human rights and the religious traditions of the Tibetan people is an unhappy evidence of the need to persist in our policy. The countries of the free world have been benefited, reinforced and drawn closer together by the vigor of American support of the United Nations and by our participation in such regional organizations as NATO, SEATO, CENTO, the Organization of American States and other collective security alliances. We assert our intention steadfastly to uphold the action and principles of these bodies. We believe military assistance to our allies under the mutual security program should be continued with all the vigor and funds needed to maintain the strength of our alliances at levels essential to our common safety. The firm diplomacy of the Eisenhower-Nixon Administration has been supported by a military power superior to any in the history of our nation or in the world. As long as world tensions menace us with war, we are resolved to maintain an armed power exceeded by no other. Under Republican administration, the Government has developed original and constructive programs in many fields, open skies, atoms for peace, cultural and technical exchanges, the peaceful uses of outer space and Antartica to make known to men everywhere our desire to advance the cause of peace. We mean, as a Party, to continue in the same course. We recognize and freely acknowledge the support given to these principles and policies by all Americans, irrespective of party. Standing as they do above partisan challenge, such principles and policies will, we earnestly hope, continue to have bipartisan support. We established a new independent agency, the United States Information Agency, full recognizing the tremendous importance of the struggle for men's minds. Today, our information program throughout the world is a greatly improved medium for explaining our policies and actions to audiences overseas, answering Communist propaganda, and projecting a true image of American life. This is the Republican record. We rededicate ourselves to the principles that have animated it, and we pledge ourselves to persist in those principles, and to apply them to the problems, the occasions, and the opportunities to be faced by the new Administration. We confront today the global offensive of Communism, increasingly aggressive and violent in its enterprises. The agency of the offensive is Soviet policy, aimed at the subversion of the world. Recently we have noted Soviet Union pretexts to intervene in the affairs of newly independent countries, accompanied by threats of the use of nuclear weapons. Such interventions constitute a form of subversion against the sovereignty of these new nations and a direct challenge to the United Nations. The immediate strategy of the Soviet imperialists is to destroy the world's confidence in America's desire for peace, to threaten with violence our mutual security arrangements, and to sever the bonds of amity and respect among the free nations. To nullify the Soviet conspiracy is our greatest task. The United States faces this challenge and resolves to meet it with courage and confidence.  To this end we will continue to support and strengthen the United Nations as an instrument for peace for international cooperation, and for the advancement of the fundamental freedoms and humane interests of mankind. Under the United Nations we will work for the peaceful settlement of international disputes and the extension of the rule of law in the world. And, in furtherance of President Eisenhower's proposals for the peaceful use of space, we suggest the United Nations take the initiative to develop a body of law applicable thereto. Through all the calculated shifts of Soviet tactics and mood, the Eisenhower-Nixon Administration has demonstrated its willingness to negotiate in earnest with the Soviet Union to arrive at just settlements for the reduction of world tensions. We pledge the new Administration to continue in the same course. We are similarly ready to negotiate and to institute realistic methods and safeguards for disarmament, and for the suspension of nuclear tests. We advocate an early agreement by all nations to forego nuclear tests in the atmosphere, and the suspension of other tests as verification techniques permit. We support the President in any decision he may make to re-evaluate the question of resumption of underground nuclear explosions testing, if the Geneva Conference fails to produce a satisfactory agreement. We have deep concern about the mounting nuclear arms race. This concern leads us to seek disarmament and nuclear agreements. And an equal concern to protect all peoples from nuclear danger, leads us to insist that such agreements have adequate safeguards. We recognize that firm political and military policies, while imperative for our security, cannot in themselves build peace in the world. In Latin America, Asia, Africa and the Middle East, peoples of ancient and recent independence, have shown their determination to improve their standards of living, and to enjoy an equality with the rest of mankind in the enjoyment of the fruits of civilization. This determination has become a primary fact of their political life. We declare ourselves to be in sympathy with their aspirations. We have already created unprecedented dimensions of diplomacy for these purposes. We recognize that upon our support of well conceived programs of economic cooperation among nations rest the best hopes of hundreds of millions of friendly people for a decent future for themselves and their children. Our mutual security program of economic help and technical assistance, the Development Loan Fund, the Inter-American Bank, the International Development Association and the Food for Peace program which create the conditions for progress in less developed countries, our leadership in international efforts to help children, eliminate pestilence and disease and aid refugees, these are programs wise in concept and generous in purpose. We mean to continue in support of them. Now we propose to futher evolution of our programs for assistance to and cooperation with other nations, suitable to the emerging needs of the future. We will encourage the countries of Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia to initiate appropriate regional groupings to work out plans for economic and educational development. We anticipate the United Nations Special Fund would be of assistance in developing such plans. The United States would offer its cooperation in planning, and the provision of technical personnel for this purpose. Agreeable to the developing nations, we would join with them in inviting countries with advanced economies to share with us a proportionate part of the capital and technical aid required. We would emphasize the increasing use of private capital and government loans, rather than outright grants, as a means of fostering independence and mutual respect. The President's recent initiative of a joint partnership program for Latin America opens the way to this approach.  We would propose that such groupings adopt means to attain viable economies following such examples as the European Common Market. And if from these institutions there should follow stronger economic and political unions, we would welcome them with our support. Despite the counterdrive of international Communism, relentless against individual freedom and subversive of the sovereignty of nations, a powerful drive for freedom has swept the world since World War II and many heroic episodes in the Communist countries have demonstrated anew that freedom will not die. The Republican Party reaffirms its determination to use every peaceful means to help the captive nations toward their independence, and thus their freedom to live and worship according to conscience. We do not condone the subjugation of the peoples of Hungary, Poland, East-Germany, Czechoslovakia, Rumania, Albania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and other once-free nations. We are not shaken in our hope and belief that once again they will rule themselves. Our time surges with change and challenge, peril and great opportunities. It calls us to great tasks and efforts, for free men can hope to guard freedom only if they prove capable of historic acts of wisdom and courage. Dwight David Eisenhower stands today throughout the world as the greatest champion of peace and justice and good. The Republican Party brings to the days ahead trained, experienced, mature and courageous leadership. Our Party was born for freedom's sake. It is still the Party of full freedom in our country. As in Lincoln's time, our Party and its leaders will meet the challenges and opportunities of our time and keep our country the best and enduring hope of freedom for the world. NATIONAL DEFENSE The future of freedom depends heavily upon America's military might and that of her allies. Under the Eisenhower-Nixon Administration, our military might has been forged into a power second to none. This strength, tailored to serve the needs of national policy, has deterred and must continue to deter aggression and encourage the growth of freedom in the world. This is the only sure way to a world at peace. We have checked aggression. We ended the war in Korea. We have joined with free nations in creating strong defenses. Swift technological change and the warning signs of Soviet aggressiveness make clear that intensified and courageous efforts are necessary, for the new problems of the 1960's will of course demand new efforts on the part of our entire nation. The Republican Party is pledged to making certain that our arms, and our will to use them, remain superior to all threats. We have, and will continue to have, the defenses we need to protect our freedom. The strategic imperatives of our national defense policy are these: A second strike capability, that is, a nuclear retaliatory power that can survive surprise attack, strike back, and destroy any possible enemy. Highly mobile and versatile forces, including forces deployed, to deter or check local agressions and ""brush fire wars"" which might bring on all-out nuclear war.  National determination to employ all necessary military capabilities so as to render any level of aggression unprofitable. Deterrence of war since Korea, specifically, has been the result of our firm statement that we will never again permit a potential aggressor to set the ground rules for his aggression, that we will respond to aggression with the full means and weapons best suited to the situation. Maintenance of these imperatives requires these actions: Unremitting modernization of our retaliatory forces continued development of the manned bomber well into the missile age, with necessary numbers of these bombers protected through dispersal and airborne alert. Development and production of new strategic weapons, such as the Polaris submarine and ballistic missile. Never again will they be neglected, as intercontinental missile development was neglected between the end of World War II and 1953. Accelerate as necessary, development of hardening, mobility, dispersal, and production programs for long-range missiles and the speedy perfection of new and advanced generations of missiles and anti-missile missiles. Intensified development of active civil defense to enable our people to protect themselves against the deadly hazards of atomic attack, particularly fallout and to develop a new program to build a reserve of storable food, adequate to the needs of the population after an atomic attack. Constant intelligence operations regarding Communist military preparations to prevent another Pearl Harbor. A military establishment organized in accord with a national strategy which enables the unified commands in Europe, the Pacific, and this continent to continue to respond promptly to any kind of aggression. Strengthening of the military might of the free world nations in such ways as to encourage them to assume increasing responsibility for regional security. Continuation of the ""long pull"" preparedness policies which, as inaugurated under the Eisenhower-Nixon Administration, have avoided the perilous peaks and slumps of defense spending and planning which marked earlier administrations. There is no price ceiling on America's security. The United States can and must provide whatever is necessary to insure its own security and that of the free world and to provide any necessary increased expenditures to meet new situations, to guarantee the opportunity to fulfill the hopes of men of good will everywhere. To provide more would be wasteful. To provide less would be catastrophic. Our defense posture must remain steadfast, confident, and superior to all potential foes. ECONOMIC GROWTH AND BUSINESS To provide the means to a better life for individual Americans and to strengthen the forces of freedom in the world, we count on the proved productivity of our free economy. Despite the lamentations of the opposition in viewing the economic scene today, the plain fact is that our 500 billion dollar economy finds more Americans at work, earning more, spending more, saving more, investing more, building more than ever before in history. The well-being of our people, by virtually every yardstick, has greatly advanced under this Republican Administration. But we can and must do better. We must raise employment to even higher levels and utilize even more fully our expanding, overall capacity to produce. We must quicken the pace of our economic growth to prove the power of American free enterprise to meet growing and urgent demands to sustain our military posture, to provide jobs for a growing labor force in a time of rapid technological change, to improve living standards, to serve all the needs of an expanding population. We therefore accord high priority to vigorous economic growth and recognize that its mainspring lies in the private sector of the economy. We must continue to foster a healthy climate in that sector. We reject the concept of artificial growth forced by massive new federal spending and loose money policies. The only effective way to accelerate economic growth is to increase the traditional strengths of our free economy, initiative and investment, productivity and efficiency. To that end we favor: Broadly-based tax reform to foster job-making and growth making investment for modernization and expansion, including realistic incentive depreciation schedules. Use of the full powers of government to prevent the scourges of depression and inflation. Elimination of featherbedding practices by labor and business. Maintenance of a stable dollar as an indispensable means to progress. Relating wage and other payments in production to productivity, except when necessary to correct inequities, in order to help us stay competitive at home and abroad. Spurring the economy by advancing the successful Eisenhower Nixon program fostering new and small business, by continued active enforcement of the anti-trust laws by protecting consumers and investors against the hazard and economic waste of fraudulent and criminal proctices in the market place, and by keeping the federal government from unjustly competing with private enterprise upon which Americans mainly depend for their livelihood. Continued improvement of our vital transportation network, carrying forward rapidly the vast Eisenhower-Nixon national highway program and promoting safe, efficient, competitive and integrated transport by air, road, rail and water under equitable, impartial and minimal regulation directed to those ends. Carrying forward, under the Trade Agreements Act, the policy of gradual selective and truly reciprocal reduction of unjustifiable barriers to trade among free nations. We advocate effective administration of the Act's escape clause and peril point provisions to safeguard American jobs and domestic industries against serious injury. In support of our national trade policy we should continue the Eisenhower-Nixon program of using this government's negotiating powers to open markets abroad and to eliminate remaining discrimination against our goods. We should also encourage the development of fair labor standards in exporting countries in the interest of fair competition in international trade. We should, too, expand the Administration's export drive, encourage tourists to come from abroad, and protect U.S. investors against arbitrary confiscations and expropriations by foreign governments. Through these and other constructive policies, we will better our international balance of payments. Discharge by government of responsibility for those activities which the private sector cannot do or cannot so well do such as constructive federal-local action to aid areas of chronic high unemployment a sensible farm policy, development and wise use of natural resources, suitable support of education and research, and equality of job opportunity for all Americans. Action on these fronts, designed to release the strongest productive force in human affairs, the spirit of individual enterprise can contribute greatly to our goal of a steady, strongly growing economy. LABOR America's growth cannot be compartmentalized. Labor and management cannot prosper without each other. They cannot ignore their mutual public obligation. Industrial harmony, expressing these mutual interests, can best be achieved in a climate of free collective-bargaining with minimal government intervention except by mediation and conciliation. Even in dealing with emergency situations imperiling the national safety, ways of solution must be found to enhance and not impede the processes of free collective-bargaining, carefully considered ways that are in keeping with the policies of national labor relations legislation and with the need to strengthen the hand of the President in dealing with such emergencies. In the same spirit, Republican leadership will continue to encourage discussions, away from the bargaining table, between labor and management to consider the mutual interest of all Americans in maintaining industrial peace. Republican policy firmly supports the right of employers and unions freely to enter into agreements providing for the union shop and other forms of union security as authorized by the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 (Taft-Hartley Act). Republican-sponsored legislation has supported the right of union members to full participation in the affairs of their union and their right to freedom from racketeering and gangster interference whether by labor or management in labor-management relations. Republican action has given to millions of American working men and women new or expanded protection and benefits, such as: Increased federal minimum wage; Extended coverage of unemployment insurance and the payment of additional temporary benefits provided in 1958-59; Improvement of veterans' re-employment rights; Extension of federal workman's compensation coverage and increase of benefits; Legislative assurance of safety standards for longshore and harbor workers and for the transportation of migratory workers; An increase of railroad workers retirement and disability benefits. Seven past years of accomplishments, however, are but a base to build upon in fostering, promoting and improving the welfare of America's working men and women, both organized and unorganized. We pledge, therefore, action on these constructive lines: Diligent administration of the amended Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947 (Taft-Hartley Act) and the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (Landrum-Griffin Act) with recommendations for improvements which experience shows are needed to make them more effective or remove any inequities. Correction of defects in the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act to protect employees' and beneficiaries' interests. Upward revision in amount and extended coverage of the minimum wage to several million more workers. Strengthening the unemployment insurance system and extension of its benefits. Improvement of the eight-hour laws relating to hours and overtime compensation on federal and federally-assisted construction, and continued vigorous enforcement and improvement of minimum wage laws for federal supply and construction contracts. Continued improvement of manpower skills and training to meet a new era of challenges, including action programs to aid older workers, women, youth, and the physically handicapped. Encouragement of training programs by labor, industry and government to aid in finding new jobs for persons dislocated by automation or other economic changes.  Improvement of job opportunities and working conditions of migratory farm workers. Assurance of equal pay for equal work regardless of sex, encouragement of programs to insure on-the-job safety, and encouragement of the States to improve their labor standards legislation, and to improve veterans employment rights and benefits. Encouragement abroad of free democratic institutions, higher living standards and higher wages through such agencies as the International Labor Organization, and cooperation with the free trade union movement in strengthening free labor throughout the world. AGRICULTURE Aamericans are the best-fed and the best-clothed people in the world. Our challenge fortunately is one of dealing with abundance, not overcoming shortage. The fullness of our fields, forests and grazing lands is an important advantage in our struggle against worldwide tyranny and our crusade against poverty. Our farmers have provided us with a powerful weapon in the ideological and economic struggle in which we are now engaged. Yet, far too many of our farm families, the source of this strength, have not received a fair return for their labors. For too long, Democratic-controlled Congresses have stalemated progress by clinging to obsolete programs conceived for different times and different problems. Promises of specific levels of price support or a single type of program for all agriculture are cruel deceptions based upon the pessimistic pretense that only with rigid controls can farm families be aided. The Republican Party will provide within the framework of individual freedom a greater bargaining power to assure an equitable return for the work and capital supplied by farmers. The Republican Party pledges itself to develop new programs to improve and stabilize farm family income. It recognizes two main challenges the immediate one of utilizing income-depressing surpluses and the long-range one of steady balanced growth and development with a minimum of federal interference and control. To utilize immediately surpluses in an orderly manner, with a minimum impact on domestic and foreign markets, we pledge: Intensification of the Food for Peace program, including new cooperative efforts among food surplus nations to assist the hungry peoples in less favored areas of the world. Payment-in-kind, out of existing surpluses, as part of our land retirement program. Creation of a Strategic Food Reserve properly dispersed in forms which can be preserved for long periods against the contingency of grave national emergency. Strengthened efforts to distribute surpluses to schools and low-income and needy citizens of our own country. A reorganization of Commodity Credit Corporation's inventory management operations to reduce competition with the marketings of farmers. To assure steady balanced growth and agricultural progress, we pledge: A crash research program to develop industrial and other uses of farm products. Use of price supports at levels best fitted to specific commodities, in order to widen markets, ease production controls, and help achieve increased farm family income. Acceleration of production adjustments, including a large scale land conservation reserve program on a voluntary and equitable rental basis, with full consideration of the impact on local communities. Continued progress in the wise use and conservation of water and soil resources.  Use of marketing agreements and orders, and other marketing devices, when approved by producers, to assist in the orderly marketing of crops, thus enabling farmers to strengthen their bargaining power. Stepped-up research to reduce production costs and to cut distribution costs. Strengthening of the educational programs of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Land-Grant institutions. Improvement of credit facilities for financing the capital needs of modern farming. Encouragement of farmer owned and operated cooperatives including rural electric and telephone facilities. Expansion of the Rural Development Program to help low-income farm families not only through better farming methods, but also through opportunities for vocational training, more effective employment services, and creation of job opportunities through encouragement of local industrialization. Continuation and further improvement of the Great Plains Program. Legislative action for programs now scheduled to expire for the school milk program, wool, and sugar, including increased sugar acreage to domestic areas. Free movement in interstate commerce of agricultural commodities meeting federal health standards. To prevent dumping of agricultural imports upon domestic markets. To assure the American farmer a more direct voice in his own destiny, we pledge:  To select an official committee of farmers and ranchers, on a regional basis, broadly representative of American agriculture, whose function will be to recommend to the President guidelines for improving the operation of government farm programs. NATURAL RESOURCES A strong and growing economy requires vigorous and persistent attention to wise conservation and sound development of all our resources. Team work between federal, state and private entities is essential and should be continued. It has resulted in sustained conservation and resource development programs on a scale unmatched in our history. The past seven years of Republican leadership have seen the development of more power capacity flood-control irrigation fish and wildlife projects, recreational facilities, and associated multipurpose benefits than during any previous administration in history. The proof is visable in the forests and waters of the land and in Republican initiation of and support of the Upper Watershed Program and the Small Reclamation Projects Act. It is clear, also, in the results of continuing administration encouraged forest management practices which have brought, for the first time, a favorable balance between the growth and cutting of america's trees. Our objective is for further growth, greater strength, and increased utilization in each great area of resource use and development. We pledge: Use of the community watershed as the basic natural unit through which water resource, soil, and forest management programs may best be developed, with interstate compacts encouraged to handle regional aspects without federal domination. Development of new water resource projects throughout the nation. Support of the historic policy of Congress in preserving the integrity of the several States to govern water rights. Continued federal support for Republican-initiated research and demonstration projects which will supply fresh water from salt and brackish water sources. Necessary measures for preservation of our domestic fisheries. Continued forestry conservation with appropriate sustained yield harvesting, thus increasing jobs for people and increasing revenue. To observe the ""preference clause"" in marketing federal power. Support of the basic principles of reclamation. Recognition of urban and industrial demands by making available to states and local governments, federal lands not needed for national programs. Full use and preservation of our great outdoors are pledged in: Completion of the ""Mission 66"" for the Improvement of National Park areas as well as sponsorship of a new ""Mission 76"" program to encourage establishment and rehabilitation of local, state, and regional parks, to provide adequate recreational facilities for our expanding population. Continued support of the effort to keep our great out-of doors beautiful, green, and clean. Establishment of a citizens board of conservation, resource and land management experts to inventory those federal lands now set aside for a particular purpose to study the future needs of the nation for parks, seashores, and wildlife and other recreational areas, and to study the possibility of restoring lands not needed for a federal program. Minerals, metals, fuels, also call for carefully considered actions in view of the repeated failure of Democratic-controlled congresses to enact any long-range minerals legislation. Republicans, therefore pledge: Long-range minerals and fuels planning and programming, including increased coal research. Assistance to mining industries in bridging the gap between peak defense demands and anticipated peacetime demands. Continued support for federal financial assistance and incentives under our tax laws to encourage exploration for domestic sources of minerals and metals, with reasonable depletion allowances. To preserve our fish and wildlife heritage, we pledge: Legislation to authorize exchange of lands between state and federal governments to adapt programs to changing uses and habits. Vigorous implementation of long-range programs for fish and wildlife. GOVERNMENT FINANCE To build a better America with broad national purposes such as high employment, vigorous and steady economic growth, and a dependable currency, responsible management of our federal finances is essential. Even more important, a sound economy is vital to national security. While leading Democrats charge us with a ""budget balancing"" mentality, their taunts really reflect their frustration over the people's recognition that as a nation we must live within our means. Government that is careless with the money of its citizens is careless with their future. Because we are concerned about the well-being of people, we are concerned about protecting the value of their money. To this end, we Republicans believe that: Every government expenditure must be tested by its contribution to the general welfare, not to any narrow interest group. Except in times of war or economic adversity, expenditures should be covered by revenues. We must work persistently to reduce, not to increase, the national debt, which imposes a heavy economic burden on every citizen. Our tax structure should be improved to provide greater incentives to economic progress, to make it fair and equitable, and to maintain and deserve public acceptance. We must resist assaults upon the independence of the Federal Reserve System, we must strengthen, not weaken, the ability of the Federal Reserve System and the Treasury Department to exercise effective control over money and credit in order better to combat both deflation and inflation that retard economic growth and shrink people's savings and earnings. In order of priority, federal revenues should be used, first, to meet the needs of national security, second, to fulfill the legitimate and urgent needs of the nation that cannot be met by the States, local governments or private action third, to pay down on the national debt in good times, finally, to improve our tax structure. National security and other essential needs will continue to make enormous demands upon public revenues. It is therefore imperative that we weigh carefully each demand for a new federal expenditure. The federal government should undertake not the most things nor the least things, but the right things. Achieving this vital purpose demands: That Congress, in acting on new spending bills, have figures before it showing the cumulative effect of its actions on the total budget. That spending commitments for future years be clearly listed in each budget, so that the effect of built-in expenditure programs may be recognized and evaluated. That the President be empowered to veto individual items in authorization and appropriation bills. That increasing efforts be made to extend business-like methods to government operations particularly in purchasing and supply activities, and in personnel. GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION The challenges of our time test the very organization of democracy. They put on trial the capacity of free government to act quickly, wisely, resolutely. To meet these challenges: The President must continue to be able to reorganize and streamline executive operations to keep the executive branch capable of responding effectively to rapidly changing conditions in both foreign and domestic fields. The Eisenhower-Nixon Sdministration did so by creating a new Department of Health, Education and Welfare, by establishing the National Aeronautics and Space Agency and the Federal Aviation Agency, and by reorganizations of the Defense Department. Two top positions should be established to assist the President in, (1) the entire field of National Security and International Affairs, and, (2) Governmental Planning and Management, particularly in domestic affairs. We must undertake further reorganization of the Defense Department to achieve the most effective unification of defense planning and command. Improved conflict-of-interest laws should be enacted for vigilant protection of the public interest and to remove deterrents to governmental service by our most able citizens. The federal government must constantly strengthen its career service and must be truly progesssive as an employer. Government employment must be a vocation deserving of high public respect. Common sense demands continued improvements in employment, training and promotion practices based on merit, effective procedures for dealing with employment grievances, and salaries which are comparable to those offered by private employers. As already practiced by the Republican membership, responsible Policy Committees should be elected by each party in each house of Congress. This would provide a mechanism for meetings of party Congressional leaders with the President when circumstances demand. Needed federal judgeships, appointed on the basis of the highest qualifications and without limitation to a single political party, should be created to expedite administration of justice in federal courts. The remarkable growth of the Post Office since 1952 to serve an additional nine million urban and one and one-half million farm families must be continued. The Post Office must be continually improved and placed on a self-sustaining basis. Progressive Republican policies of the past seven years have resulted in reduced costs, decentralization of postal operations, liberal pay, fringe benefits, improved working conditions, streamlined management, and improved service. Vigorous state and local governments are a vital part of our federal union. The federal government should leave to state and local governments those programs and problems which they can best handle and tax sources adequate to finance them. We must continue to improve liaison between federal, state and local government. We believe that the federal government, when apporpriate, should render significant assistance in dealing with our urgent problems of urban growth and change. No vast new bureaucracy is needed to achieve this objective. We favor a change in the Electoral College system to give every voter a fair voice in presidential elections. We condemn bigotry, smear and other unfair tactics in political campaigns. We favor realistic and effective safeguards against diverting non-political funds to partisan political purposes. Republicans will continue to work for Congressional representation and self-government for the District of Columbia and also support the constitutional amendment granting suffrage in national elections. We support the right of the Puerto Rican people to achieve statehood, whenever they freely so determine. We support the right of the people of the Virgin Islands to an elected Governor national representation and suffrage, looking toward eventual statehood, when qualified. We also support the right of the people of Guam to an elected Governor and national representation. These pledges are meaningful from the Republican leadership under which Alaska and Hawaii have newly entered the Union. Congress should submit a constitutional amendment providing equal rights for women. EDUCATION The rapid pace of international developments serves to re emphasisize dramatically the challenge which generations of Americans will face in the years ahead. We are reminded daily of the crucial importance of strengthening our system of education to prepare our youth for understanding and shaping the powerful emerging forces of the modern world and to permit the fullest possible development of individual capacities and potentialities. We express our greatefulness and we praise the countless thousands of teachers who have devoted themselves in an inspired way towards the development of our greatest heritage, our own children, the youth of the country. Education is not a luxury, nor a gift to be bestowed upon ourselves and our children. education is an investment our schools cannot become second best. Each person possesses the right to education, it is his birthright in a free Republic. Primary responsibility for education must remain with the local community and state. The federal government should assist selectively in strengthening education without interfering with full local control of schools. One objective of such federal assistance should be to help equalize educational opportunities. Under the Eisenhower-Nixon Administration, the federal government will spend more than a billion dollars in 1960 to strengthen American education. We commend the objective of the Republican Administration in sponsoring the National Defense Education Act to stimulate improvement of study and teaching in selected fields at the local level. Toward the goal of fullest possible educational opportunity for every American, we pledge these actions: Federal support to the primary and secondary schools by a program of federal aid for school construction, pacing it to the real needs of individual school districts in states and territories, and requiring state approval and participation. Stimulation of actions designed to update and strengthen vocational education for both youth and adults. Support of efforts to make adequate library facilities available to all our citizens. Continued support of programs to strengthen basic research in education to discover the best methods for helping handicapped, retarded, and gifted children to realize their highest potential. The federal government can also play a part in stimulating higher education. Constructive action would include: The federal program to assist in construction of college housing. Extension of the federal student loan program and graduate fellowship program. Consideration of means through tax laws to help offset tuition costs. Continued support of the East-West Center for cultural and technical interchange in Hawaii for the purpose of strengthening our relationship with the peoples of the Pacific world. Federal matching grants to help states finance the cost of state surveys and inventories of the status and needs of their school systems. Provision should be made for continuous attention to education at all levels by the creation of a permanent, top-level commission to advise the President and the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, constantly striving to focus the interest of each citizen on the quality of our education at every level, from primary through post-graduate, and for every age group from children to adults. We are aware of the fact that there is a temporary shortage of classrooms for our elementary and secondary schools in a limited number of states. But this shortage, due to the vigilant action of state legislatures and local school boards, is not increasing, but is decreasing. We shall use our full efforts in all the states of the Union to have these legislatures and school boards augment their present efforts to the end that this temporary shortage may be eliminated and that every child in this country shall have the opportunity to obtain a good education. The respective states as a permanent program can shoulder this long standing and cherished responsibility easier than can the federal government with its heavy indebtedness. We believe moreover that any large plan of federal aid to education, such as direct contributions to or grants for teachers salaries can only lead ultimately to federal domination and control of our schools to which we are unalterably opposed. In the words of President Eisenhower, ""Education best fulfills its high purpose when responsibility for education is kept close to the people it serves, when it is rooted in the homes, nurtured in the community and sustained by a rich variety of public, private and individual resources. The bond linking home and school and community, the responsiveness of each to the needs of the other is a precious asset of American education"". SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY Much of America's future depends upon the inquisitive mind, freely searching nature for ways to conquer disease, poverty and grinding physical demands, and for knowledge of space and the atom. We Republicans express our profound gratitude to the great scientists and engineers of our country, both in and out of government, for the remarkable progress they have made. Reliable evidence indicates, all areas of scientific knowledge considered, that our country has been, is, and under our system of free inquiry, will continue to be the greatest arsenal and reservoir of effective scientific knowledge in the world. We pledge our continued leadership in every field of science and technology, earthbound as well as spacial, to assure a citadel of liberty from which the fruits of freedom may be carried to all people. Our continuing and great national need is basic research, a wellspring of knowledge and progress. Government must continue to take a responsible role in science to assure that worthwhile endeavors of national significance are not retarded by practical limitations of private and local support. This demands from all Americans the intellectual leadership and understanding so necessary for these creative endeavors and an equal understanding by our scientists and technicians of the needs and hopes of mankind. We believe the federal roles in research to be in the area of (1) basic research which industry can not be reasonably expected to pursue, and (2) applied research in fields of prime national concern such as national defense, exploration and use of space, public health, and better common use of all natural resources, both human and physical. We endorse the contracting by government agencies for research and urge allowance for reasonable charges for overhead and management in connection therewith. The vigor of American science and technology may best be inspired by: An environment of freedom and public understanding in which intellectual achievement and scientific research may flourish. A decentralization of research into as many centers of creativity as possible. The encouragement of colleges and universities, private enterprise, and foundations as a growing source of new ideas and new applications. Opportunity for scientists and engineers, in and out of government, to pursue their search with utmost aggressiveness. Continuation of the advisory committee to represent the views of the scientific community to the President and of the Federal Council for Science and Technology to foster coordination in planning and execution. Continued expansion of the Eisenhower-Nixon Atoms-for-Peace program and a constant striving, backed by scientific advice, for international agreement for peaceful and cooperative exploration and use of space. HUMAN NEEDS The ultimate objective of our free society and of an ever growing economy is to enable the individual to pursue a life of dignity and to devolop his own capacities to his maximum potential. Government's primary role is to help provide the environment within which the individual can seek his own goals. In some areas this requires federal action to supplement individual, local and state initiative. The Republican Party has acted and will act decisively, compassionately, and with deep human understanding in approaching such problems as those of the aged, the infirm, the mentally ill, and the needy. This is demonstrated by the significant increase in social security coverage and benefits as a result of recommendations made by the Eisenhower-Nixon Administration. As a result of these recommendations and normal growth, 14 million persons are receiving benefits today compared to five million in 1952, and benefit payments total ten and one-third billion dollars as compared to two and one-half billion dollars in 1952. In addition, there have been increases in payments to those on public assistance, both for their basic needs and for their health and medical care and a broad expansion in our federal-state program for restoring disabled persons to useful lives, an expansion which has accomplished the rehabilitation of over half a million persons during this Administration. New needs, however, are constantly arising in our highly complex, interdependent, and urbanized society. Older Citizens To meet the needs of the aging, we pledge: Expansion of coverage, and liberalization of selected social security benefits on a basis which would maintain the fiscal integrity of the system. Support of federal-state grant programs to improve health, welfare and rehabilitation services for the handicapped older persons and to improve standards of nursing home care and care and treatment facilities for the chronically and mentally ill. Federal leadership to encourage policies that will make retirement at a fixed age voluntary and not compulsory. Support of programs that will persuade and encourage the nation to utilize fully the skills, wisdom and experience of older citizens. Prompt consideration of recommendations by the White House Conference on Aging called by the President for January, 1961. Health Aid Development of a health program that will provide the aged needing it, on a sound fiscal basis and through a contributory system, protection against burdensome costs of health care. such a program should: Provide the beneficiaries with the option of purchasing private health insurance, a vital distinction between our approach and Democratic proposals in that it would encourage commercial carriers and voluntary insurance organizations to continue their efforts to develop sound coverage plans for the senior population. Protect the personal relationship of patient and physician. Include state participation. For the needs which individuals of all age groups cannot meet by themselves, we propose: Removing the arbitary 50 year age requirement under the disability insurance program while amending the law also to provide incentives for rehabilitated persons to return to useful work. A single, federal assistance grant to each state for aid to needy persons rather than dividing such grants into specific categories. A strengthened federal state program to rehabilitate the estimated 200,000 persons who annually could become independent after proper medical services and occupational training. A new federal state program, for handicapped persons completely dependent on others, to help them meet their needs for personal care. Juvenile Delinquency The Federal Government can and should help state and local communities combat juvenile delinquency by inaugurating a grant program for research, demonstration, and training projects and by placing greater emphasis on strengthening family life in all welfare programs for which it shares responsibility. VETERANS We believe that military service in the defense of our Republic against aggressors who have sought to destroy the freedom and dignity of man imposes upon the nation a special responsibility to those who have served. To meet this responsibility, we pledge: Continuance of the Veterans Administration as an independent agency. The highest possible standard of medical care with increasing emphasis on rehabilitation. Indian Affairs As recently as 1953 thirty percent of Indian school age children were unable to obtain an education. Through Republican efforts, this fall, for the first time in history, every eligible Indian child will be able to attend an elementary school. Having accomplished this, we will now accelerate our efforts to open up both secondary and higher education opportunities for every qualified Indian youth. As a result of a stepped up health program there has been a marked decrease in death rates from tuberculosis and in the infant mortality rate. Also substantial progress has been made in the modernization of health facilities. We pledge continued progress in this area. We are opposed to precipitous termination of the federal Indian trusteeship responsibility, and pledge not to support any termination plan for any tribe which has not approved such action. Housing Despite noteworthy accomplishments, stubborn and deep-seated problems stand in the way of achieving the national objective of a decent home in a suitable environment for every American. Recognizing that the federal government must help provide the economic climate and incentives which make this objective obtainable, the Republican Party will vigorously support the following steps, all designed to supplement and not supplant private initiative. Continued effort to clear slums, and promote rebuilding, rehabilitation, and conservation of our cities. New programs to stimulate development of specialized types of housing, such as those for the elderly and for nursing homes. A program of research and demonstration aimed at finding ways to reduce housing costs, including support of efforts to modernize and improve local building codes. Adequate authority for the federal housing agencies to assist the flow of mortgage credit into private housing, with emphasis on homes for middle-income and lower-income families and including assistance in urban residential areas. A stepped up program to assist in urban planning, designed to assure far-sighted and wise use of land and to coordinate mass transportation and other vital facilities in our metropolitan areas. Health There has been a five-fold increase in government assisted medical research during the last six years. We pledge: Continued federal support for a sound research program aimed at both the prevention and cure of diseases, and intensified efforts to secure prompt and effective application of the results of research. This will include emphasis on mental illness. Support of international health research programs. We face serious personnel shortages in the health and medical fields. We pledge:  Federal help in new programs to build schools of medicine, dentistry, and public health and nursing, and financial aid to students in those fields. We are confronted with major problems in the field of environmental health. we pledge: Strengthened federal enforcement powers in combatting water pollution and additional resources for research and demonstration projects. Federal grants for the construction of waste disposal plants should be made only when they make an identifiable contribution to clearing up polluted streams. Federal authority to identify, after appropriate hearings, air pollution problems and to recommend proposed solutions. Additional resources for research and training in the field of radiological medicine. Protection of Consumers In safeguarding the health of the nation the Eisenhower-Nixon Administration's initiative has resulted in doubling the resources of the Food and Drug Administration and in giving it new legal weapons. More progress has been made during this period in protecting consumers against harmful food, drugs, and cosmetics than in any other time in our history. We will continue to give strong support to this consumer-protection program. CIVIL RIGHTS This nation was created to give expression, validity and purpose to our spiritual heritage, the supreme worth of the individual. In such a nation, a nation dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal, racial discrimination has no place. It can hardly be reconciled with a Constitution that guarantees equal protection under law to all persons. In a deeper sense, too, it is immoral and unjust. As to those matters within reach of political action and leadership, we pledge ourselves unreservedly to its eradication. Equality under law promises more than the equal right to vote and transcends mere relief from discrimination by government. It becomes a reality only when all persons have equal opportunity, without distinction of race, religion, color or national origin, to acquire the essentials of life, housing, education and employment. The Republican Party, the party of Abraham Lincoln from its very beginning has striven to make this promise a reality. It is today, as it was then, unequivocally dedicated to making the greatest amount of progress toward the objective. We recognize that discrimination is not a problem localized in one area of the country, but rather a problem that must be faced by North and South alike. Nor is discrimination confined to the discrimination against Negroes. Discrimination in many, if not all, areas of the country on the basis of creed or national origin is equally insidious. Further we recognize that in many communities in which a century of custom and tradition must be overcome heartening and commendable progress has been made. The Republican Party is proud of the civil rights record of the Eisenhower Administration. More progress has been made during the past eight years than in the preceding 80 years. We acted promptly to end discrimination in our nation's capital. Vigorous executive action was taken to complete swiftly the desegregation of the armed forces, veterans hospitals, navy yards, and other federal establishments. We supported the position of the Negro school children before the Supreme Court. We believe the Supreme Court school decision should be carried out in accordance with the mandate of the Court. Although the Democratic-controlled Congress watered them down the Republican Administration's recommendations resulted in significant and effective civil rights legislation in both 1957 and 1960 the first civil rights statutes to be passed in more than 80 years. Hundreds of Negroes have already been registered to vote as a result of Department of Justice action, some in counties where Negroes did not vote before. The new law will soon make it possible for thousands and thousands of Negroes previously disenfranchised to vote. By executive order, a committee for the elimination of discrimination in government employment has been reestablished with broadened authority. Today, nearly one-fourth of all federal employees are Negro. The President's Committee on Government Contracts under the chairmanship of Vice-President Nixon has become an impressive force for the elimination of discriminatory employment practices of private companies that do business with the government. Other important achievements include initial steps toward the elimination of segregation in federally aided housing the establishment of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, which enforces federal civil rights laws and the appointment of the bi-partisan Civil Rights Commission which has prepared a significant report that lays the groundwork for further legislative action and progress. The Republican record is a record of progress not merely promises. Nevertheless, we recognize that much remains to be done. Each of the following pledges is practical and within realistic reach of accomplishment. They are serious, not cynical pledges made to result in maximum progress. 1. Voting. We pledge: Continued vigorous enforcement of the civil rights laws to guarantee the right to vote to all citizens in all areas of the country. Legislation to provide that the completion of six primary grades in a state accredited school is conclusive evidence of literacy for voting purposes. 2. Public Schools. We pledge: The Department of Justice will continue its vigorous support of court orders for school desegregation. Desegregation suits now pending involve at least 39 school districts. Those suits and others already concluded will effect most major cities in which school segregation is being practiced. It will use the new authority provided by the Civil Rights Act of 1960 to prevent obstruction of court orders. We will propose legislation to authorize the Attorney General to bring actions for school desegregation in the name of the United States in appropriate cases as when economic coercion or threat of physical harm is used to deter persons from going to court to establish their rights. Our continuing support of the President's proposal, to extend federal aid and technical assistance to schools which in good faith attempted to desegregate. We oppose the pretense of fixing a target date three years from now for the mere submission of plans for school desegregation. Slow moving school districts would construe it as a three year moratorium during which progress would cease, postponing until 1963 the legal process to enforce compliance. We believe that each of the pending court actions should proceed as the Supreme Court has directed and that in no district should there be any such delay. 3. Employment. We pledge: Continued support for legislation to establish a Commission on Equal Job Opportunity to make permanent and to expand with legislative backing the excellent work being performed by the President's Committee on Government Contracts. Appropirate legislation to end the discriminatory membership practices are eradicated promptly by the labor unions themselves. Use of the full-scale review of existing state laws, and of prior proposals for federal legislation, to eliminate discrimination in employment now being conducted by the Civil Rights Commission, for guidance in our objective of developing a Federal-State program in the employment area. Special consideration of training programs aimed at developing the skills of those now working in marginal agricultural employment so that they can obtain employment in industry, notably in the new industries moving into the South. 4. Housing. We pledge: Action to prohibit discrimination in housing constructed with the aid of federal subsidies. 5. Public Facilities and Services. We pledge: Removal of any vestige of discrimination in the operation of federal facilities or procedures which may at any time be found. Opposition to the use of federal funds for the construction of segregated community facilities. Action to ensure that public transportation and other government authorized services shall be free from segregation. 6. Legislative Procedure. We pledge: Our best efforts to change present Rule 22 of the Senate and other appropriate Congressional procedures that often make unattainable proper legislative implementation of consititutional guarantees. We reaffirm the constitutional right to peaceable assembly to protect discrimination in private business establishments. We applaud the action of the businessmen who have abandoned discriminatory practices in retail establishments, and we urge others to follow their example. Finally we recognize that civil rights is a responsibility not only of states and localities it is a national problem and a national responsibility. The federal government should take the initiative in promoting inter-group conferences among those who, in their communities, are earnestly seeking solutions of the complex problems of desegregation to the end that closed channels of communication may be opened, tensions eased, and a cooperative solution of local problems may be sought. In summary, we pledge the full use of the power, resources and leadership of the federal government to eliminate discrimination based on race, color, religion or national origin and to encourage understanding and good will among all races and creeds. IMMIGRATION Immigration has historically been a great factor in the growth of the United States not only in numbers but in the enrichment of ideas that immigrants have brought with them. This Republican Administration has given refuge to over 32,000 victims of Communist tyranny from Hungary, ended needless delay in processing applications for naturalization, and has urged other enlightened legislation to liberalize existing restrictions. Immigration has been reduced to the point where it does not provide the stimulus to growth that it should, nor are we fulfilling our obligation as a haven for the oppressed. Republican conscience and Republican policy require that: The annual number of immigrants we accept be at least doubled. Obsolete immigration laws be ammended by abandoning the outdated 1920 census data as a base and substituting the 1960 census. The guidelines of our immigration policy be based upon judgment of the individual merit of each applicant for admission and citizenship. CONCLUSION We have set forth the program of the Republican Party for the government of the United States. We have written a Party document as is our duty but we have tried to refrain from writing a merely partisan document. We have no wish to exaggerate differences between ourselves and the Democratic Party nor can we, in conscience, obscure the differences that do exist. We believe that the Republican program is based upon a sounder understanding of the action and scope of government. There are many things a free government cannot do for its people as well as they can do themselves. There are some things no government should promise or attempt to do. The functions of government are so great as to bear no needless enlargement. We limit our proposals and our pledges to those areas for which the government of a great republic can reasonably be made responsible. To the best of our ability we have avoided advocating measures that would go against the grain of a free people. The history and composition of the Republican Party make it the natural instrument for eradicating the injustice and discrimination in this country. We Republicans are fortunate in being able to contend against these evils, without having to contend against each other for the principle. We believe that we see, so far as men can see through the obscurity of time and trouble, the prudent course for the nation in its hour of trial. The Soviet Union has created another of the new situations of peril which has been the Communist record from the beginning and will continue to be until our strategy for victory has succeeded. The speed of technological change makes it imperative that we measure the new situations by their special requirements and accelerate as appropriate our efforts in every direction, economic and military and political to deal with them. As rapidly as we perfect the new generations of weapons we must arm ourselves effectively and without delay. In this respect the nation stands now at one of the new points of departure. We must never allow our technology, particularly in nuclear and propulsion fields, to lag for any reason until such time as we have dependable and honest safeguards of inspection and control. We must take steps at once to secure our position in this regard and at the same time we must intensify our efforts to develop better safeguards in the field of disarmament. The free nations of the world must ever be rallied to the cause and be encouraged to join together in more effective alliances and unions strong enough to meet all challenges and sustain the common effort. It is urgent that we innovate to keep the initiative for our free cause. We offer toil and sweat, to ward off blood and tears. We advocate an immovable resistance against every Communist aggression. We argue for a military might commensurate with our universal tasks. We end by declaring our faith in the Republic and in its people, and in the deathless principles of right from which it draws its moral force.",69857,10690,"preamble the united states is living in an age of profoundest revolution. the lives of men and of nations are undergoing such transformations as history has rarely recorded. the birth of new nations, the impact of new machines, the threat of new weapons, the stirring of new ideas, the ascent into a new dimension of the universe, everywhere the accent falls on the new. at such a time of world upheaval, great perils match great opportunities and hopes, as well as fears, rise in all areas of human life. such a force as nuclear power symbolizes the greatness of the choice before the united states and mankind. the energy of the atom could bring devastation to humanity. or it could be made to serve men's hopes for peace and progress to make for all peoples a more healthy and secure and prosperous life than man has ever known. one fact darkens the reasonable hopes of free men, the growing vigor and thrust of communist imperialism. everywhere across the earth, this force challenges us to prove our strength and wisdom, our capacity for sacrifice, our faith in ourselves and in our institutions. free men look to us for leadership and support which we dedicate ourselves to give out of the abundance of our national strength. the fate of the world will be deeply affected, perhaps determined, by the quality of american leadership. american leadership means both how we govern ourselves and how we help to influence others. we deliberate the choice of national leadership and policy, mindful that in some measure our proposals involve the fate of mankind. the leadership of the united states must be responsible and mature its promises must be rational and practical, soberly pledged and faithfully undertaken. its purposes and its aspirations must ascend to that high ground of right and freedom upon which mankind may dwell and progress in decent security. we are impressed, but not dismayed, by the revolutionary turbulence that is wracking the world. in the midst of violence and change, we draw strength and confidence from the changeless principles of our free constitution. free men are invincible when the power and courage, the patience and the fortitude latent in them are drawn forth by reasonable appeal. in this republican platform we offer to the united states our program, our call to service, our pledge of leadership, our proposal of measures in the public interest. we call upon god, in whose hand is every blessing, to favor our deliberations with wisdom, our nation with endurance, and troubled mankind everywhere with a righteous peace. foreign policy the republican party asserts that the sovereign purpose of our foreign policy is to secure the free institutions of our nation against every peril, to hearten and fortify the love of freedom everywhere in the world, and to achieve a just peace for all of anxious humanity. the pre-eminence of this republic requires of us a vigorous, resolute foreign policy, inflexible against every tyrannical encroachment, and mighty in its advance toward our own affirmative goals. the government of the united states under the administration of president eisenhower and vice president nixon has demonstrated that firmness in the face of threatened aggression is the most dependable safeguard of peace. we now reaffirm our determination to defend the security and the freedom of our country, to honor our commitments to our allies at whatever cost or sacrifice, and never to submit to force or threats. our determination to stand fast has forestalled aggression before berlin, in the formosa straits, and in lebanon. since no free nation has fallen victim behind the iron curtain. we mean to adhere to the policy of firmness that has served us so well. we are unalterably committed to maintaining the security, freedom and solidarity of the western hemisphere. we support president eisenhower's reaffirmation of the monroe doctrine in all its vitality. faithful to our treaty commitments, we shall join the republics of the americas against any intervention in our hemisphere, and in refusing to tolerate the establishment in this hemisphere of any government dominated by the foreign rule of communism. in the middle east, we shall continue to support the integrity and independence of all the states of that area including israel and the arab states. with specific reference to israel and the arab nations we urge them to undertake negotiations for a mutually acceptable settlement of the causes of tension between them. we pledge continued efforts: to eliminate the obstacles to a lasting peace in the area, including the human problem of the arab refugees. to seek an end to transit and trade restrictions, blockades and boycotts. to secure freedom of navigation in international waterways, the cessation of discrimination against americans on the basis of religious beliefs, and an end to the wasteful and dangerous arms race and to the threat of an arms imbalance in the area. recognition of communist china and its admission to the united nations have been firmly opposed by the republican administration. we will continue in this opposition because of compelling evidence that to do otherwise would weaken the cause of freedom and endanger the future of the free peoples of asia and the world. the brutal suppression of the human rights and the religious traditions of the tibetan people is an unhappy evidence of the need to persist in our policy. the countries of the free world have been benefited, reinforced and drawn closer together by the vigor of american support of the united nations and by our participation in such regional organizations as nato, seato, cento, the organization of american states and other collective security alliances. we assert our intention steadfastly to uphold the action and principles of these bodies. we believe military assistance to our allies under the mutual security program should be continued with all the vigor and funds needed to maintain the strength of our alliances at levels essential to our common safety. the firm diplomacy of the eisenhower-nixon administration has been supported by a military power superior to any in the history of our nation or in the world. as long as world tensions menace us with war, we are resolved to maintain an armed power exceeded by no other. under republican administration, the government has developed original and constructive programs in many fields, open skies, atoms for peace, cultural and technical exchanges, the peaceful uses of outer space and antartica to make known to men everywhere our desire to advance the cause of peace. we mean, as a party, to continue in the same course. we recognize and freely acknowledge the support given to these principles and policies by all americans, irrespective of party. standing as they do above partisan challenge, such principles and policies will, we earnestly hope, continue to have bipartisan support. we established a new independent agency, the united states information agency, full recognizing the tremendous importance of the struggle for men's minds. today, our information program throughout the world is a greatly improved medium for explaining our policies and actions to audiences overseas, answering communist propaganda, and projecting a true image of american life. this is the republican record. we rededicate ourselves to the principles that have animated it, and we pledge ourselves to persist in those principles, and to apply them to the problems, the occasions, and the opportunities to be faced by the new administration. we confront today the global offensive of communism, increasingly aggressive and violent in its enterprises. the agency of the offensive is soviet policy, aimed at the subversion of the world. recently we have noted soviet union pretexts to intervene in the affairs of newly independent countries, accompanied by threats of the use of nuclear weapons. such interventions constitute a form of subversion against the sovereignty of these new nations and a direct challenge to the united nations. the immediate strategy of the soviet imperialists is to destroy the world's confidence in america's desire for peace, to threaten with violence our mutual security arrangements, and to sever the bonds of amity and respect among the free nations. to nullify the soviet conspiracy is our greatest task. the united states faces this challenge and resolves to meet it with courage and confidence. to this end we will continue to support and strengthen the united nations as an instrument for peace for international cooperation, and for the advancement of the fundamental freedoms and humane interests of mankind. under the united nations we will work for the peaceful settlement of international disputes and the extension of the rule of law in the world. and, in furtherance of president eisenhower's proposals for the peaceful use of space, we suggest the united nations take the initiative to develop a body of law applicable thereto. through all the calculated shifts of soviet tactics and mood, the eisenhower-nixon administration has demonstrated its willingness to negotiate in earnest with the soviet union to arrive at just settlements for the reduction of world tensions. we pledge the new administration to continue in the same course. we are similarly ready to negotiate and to institute realistic methods and safeguards for disarmament, and for the suspension of nuclear tests. we advocate an early agreement by all nations to forego nuclear tests in the atmosphere, and the suspension of other tests as verification techniques permit. we support the president in any decision he may make to re-evaluate the question of resumption of underground nuclear explosions testing, if the geneva conference fails to produce a satisfactory agreement. we have deep concern about the mounting nuclear arms race. this concern leads us to seek disarmament and nuclear agreements. and an equal concern to protect all peoples from nuclear danger, leads us to insist that such agreements have adequate safeguards. we recognize that firm political and military policies, while imperative for our security, cannot in themselves build peace in the world. in latin america, asia, africa and the middle east, peoples of ancient and recent independence, have shown their determination to improve their standards of living, and to enjoy an equality with the rest of mankind in the enjoyment of the fruits of civilization. this determination has become a primary fact of their political life. we declare ourselves to be in sympathy with their aspirations. we have already created unprecedented dimensions of diplomacy for these purposes. we recognize that upon our support of well conceived programs of economic cooperation among nations rest the best hopes of hundreds of millions of friendly people for a decent future for themselves and their children. our mutual security program of economic help and technical assistance, the development loan fund, the inter-american bank, the international development association and the food for peace program which create the conditions for progress in less developed countries, our leadership in international efforts to help children, eliminate pestilence and disease and aid refugees, these are programs wise in concept and generous in purpose. we mean to continue in support of them. now we propose to futher evolution of our programs for assistance to and cooperation with other nations, suitable to the emerging needs of the future. we will encourage the countries of latin america, africa, the middle east, and asia to initiate appropriate regional groupings to work out plans for economic and educational development. we anticipate the united nations special fund would be of assistance in developing such plans. the united states would offer its cooperation in planning, and the provision of technical personnel for this purpose. agreeable to the developing nations, we would join with them in inviting countries with advanced economies to share with us a proportionate part of the capital and technical aid required. we would emphasize the increasing use of private capital and government loans, rather than outright grants, as a means of fostering independence and mutual respect. the president's recent initiative of a joint partnership program for latin america opens the way to this approach. we would propose that such groupings adopt means to attain viable economies following such examples as the european common market. and if from these institutions there should follow stronger economic and political unions, we would welcome them with our support. despite the counterdrive of international communism, relentless against individual freedom and subversive of the sovereignty of nations, a powerful drive for freedom has swept the world since world war ii and many heroic episodes in the communist countries have demonstrated anew that freedom will not die. the republican party reaffirms its determination to use every peaceful means to help the captive nations toward their independence, and thus their freedom to live and worship according to conscience. we do not condone the subjugation of the peoples of hungary, poland, east-germany, czechoslovakia, rumania, albania, bulgaria, latvia, lithuania, estonia and other once-free nations. we are not shaken in our hope and belief that once again they will rule themselves. our time surges with change and challenge, peril and great opportunities. it calls us to great tasks and efforts, for free men can hope to guard freedom only if they prove capable of historic acts of wisdom and courage. dwight david eisenhower stands today throughout the world as the greatest champion of peace and justice and good. the republican party brings to the days ahead trained, experienced, mature and courageous leadership. our party was born for freedom's sake. it is still the party of full freedom in our country. as in lincoln's time, our party and its leaders will meet the challenges and opportunities of our time and keep our country the best and enduring hope of freedom for the world. national defense the future of freedom depends heavily upon america's military might and that of her allies. under the eisenhower-nixon administration, our military might has been forged into a power second to none. this strength, tailored to serve the needs of national policy, has deterred and must continue to deter aggression and encourage the growth of freedom in the world. this is the only sure way to a world at peace. we have checked aggression. we ended the war in korea. we have joined with free nations in creating strong defenses. swift technological change and the warning signs of soviet aggressiveness make clear that intensified and courageous efforts are necessary, for the new problems of the 's will of course demand new efforts on the part of our entire nation. the republican party is pledged to making certain that our arms, and our will to use them, remain superior to all threats. we have, and will continue to have, the defenses we need to protect our freedom. the strategic imperatives of our national defense policy are these: a second strike capability, that is, a nuclear retaliatory power that can survive surprise attack, strike back, and destroy any possible enemy. highly mobile and versatile forces, including forces deployed, to deter or check local agressions and ""brush fire wars"" which might bring on all-out nuclear war. national determination to employ all necessary military capabilities so as to render any level of aggression unprofitable. deterrence of war since korea, specifically, has been the result of our firm statement that we will never again permit a potential aggressor to set the ground rules for his aggression, that we will respond to aggression with the full means and weapons best suited to the situation. maintenance of these imperatives requires these actions: unremitting modernization of our retaliatory forces continued development of the manned bomber well into the missile age, with necessary numbers of these bombers protected through dispersal and airborne alert. development and production of new strategic weapons, such as the polaris submarine and ballistic missile. never again will they be neglected, as intercontinental missile development was neglected between the end of world war ii and . accelerate as necessary, development of hardening, mobility, dispersal, and production programs for long-range missiles and the speedy perfection of new and advanced generations of missiles and anti-missile missiles. intensified development of active civil defense to enable our people to protect themselves against the deadly hazards of atomic attack, particularly fallout and to develop a new program to build a reserve of storable food, adequate to the needs of the population after an atomic attack. constant intelligence operations regarding communist military preparations to prevent another pearl harbor. a military establishment organized in accord with a national strategy which enables the unified commands in europe, the pacific, and this continent to continue to respond promptly to any kind of aggression. strengthening of the military might of the free world nations in such ways as to encourage them to assume increasing responsibility for regional security. continuation of the ""long pull"" preparedness policies which, as inaugurated under the eisenhower-nixon administration, have avoided the perilous peaks and slumps of defense spending and planning which marked earlier administrations. there is no price ceiling on america's security. the united states can and must provide whatever is necessary to insure its own security and that of the free world and to provide any necessary increased expenditures to meet new situations, to guarantee the opportunity to fulfill the hopes of men of good will everywhere. to provide more would be wasteful. to provide less would be catastrophic. our defense posture must remain steadfast, confident, and superior to all potential foes. economic growth and business to provide the means to a better life for individual americans and to strengthen the forces of freedom in the world, we count on the proved productivity of our free economy. despite the lamentations of the opposition in viewing the economic scene today, the plain fact is that our billion dollar economy finds more americans at work, earning more, spending more, saving more, investing more, building more than ever before in history. the well-being of our people, by virtually every yardstick, has greatly advanced under this republican administration. but we can and must do better. we must raise employment to even higher levels and utilize even more fully our expanding, overall capacity to produce. we must quicken the pace of our economic growth to prove the power of american free enterprise to meet growing and urgent demands to sustain our military posture, to provide jobs for a growing labor force in a time of rapid technological change, to improve living standards, to serve all the needs of an expanding population. we therefore accord high priority to vigorous economic growth and recognize that its mainspring lies in the private sector of the economy. we must continue to foster a healthy climate in that sector. we reject the concept of artificial growth forced by massive new federal spending and loose money policies. the only effective way to accelerate economic growth is to increase the traditional strengths of our free economy, initiative and investment, productivity and efficiency. to that end we favor: broadly-based tax reform to foster job-making and growth making investment for modernization and expansion, including realistic incentive depreciation schedules. use of the full powers of government to prevent the scourges of depression and inflation. elimination of featherbedding practices by labor and business. maintenance of a stable dollar as an indispensable means to progress. relating wage and other payments in production to productivity, except when necessary to correct inequities, in order to help us stay competitive at home and abroad. spurring the economy by advancing the successful eisenhower nixon program fostering new and small business, by continued active enforcement of the anti-trust laws by protecting consumers and investors against the hazard and economic waste of fraudulent and criminal proctices in the market place, and by keeping the federal government from unjustly competing with private enterprise upon which americans mainly depend for their livelihood. continued improvement of our vital transportation network, carrying forward rapidly the vast eisenhower-nixon national highway program and promoting safe, efficient, competitive and integrated transport by air, road, rail and water under equitable, impartial and minimal regulation directed to those ends. carrying forward, under the trade agreements act, the policy of gradual selective and truly reciprocal reduction of unjustifiable barriers to trade among free nations. we advocate effective administration of the act's escape clause and peril point provisions to safeguard american jobs and domestic industries against serious injury. in support of our national trade policy we should continue the eisenhower-nixon program of using this government's negotiating powers to open markets abroad and to eliminate remaining discrimination against our goods. we should also encourage the development of fair labor standards in exporting countries in the interest of fair competition in international trade. we should, too, expand the administration's export drive, encourage tourists to come from abroad, and protect u.s. investors against arbitrary confiscations and expropriations by foreign governments. through these and other constructive policies, we will better our international balance of payments. discharge by government of responsibility for those activities which the private sector cannot do or cannot so well do such as constructive federal-local action to aid areas of chronic high unemployment a sensible farm policy, development and wise use of natural resources, suitable support of education and research, and equality of job opportunity for all americans. action on these fronts, designed to release the strongest productive force in human affairs, the spirit of individual enterprise can contribute greatly to our goal of a steady, strongly growing economy. labor america's growth cannot be compartmentalized. labor and management cannot prosper without each other. they cannot ignore their mutual public obligation. industrial harmony, expressing these mutual interests, can best be achieved in a climate of free collective-bargaining with minimal government intervention except by mediation and conciliation. even in dealing with emergency situations imperiling the national safety, ways of solution must be found to enhance and not impede the processes of free collective-bargaining, carefully considered ways that are in keeping with the policies of national labor relations legislation and with the need to strengthen the hand of the president in dealing with such emergencies. in the same spirit, republican leadership will continue to encourage discussions, away from the bargaining table, between labor and management to consider the mutual interest of all americans in maintaining industrial peace. republican policy firmly supports the right of employers and unions freely to enter into agreements providing for the union shop and other forms of union security as authorized by the labor management relations act of (taft-hartley act). republican-sponsored legislation has supported the right of union members to full participation in the affairs of their union and their right to freedom from racketeering and gangster interference whether by labor or management in labor-management relations. republican action has given to millions of american working men and women new or expanded protection and benefits, such as: increased federal minimum wage; extended coverage of unemployment insurance and the payment of additional temporary benefits provided in -; improvement of veterans' re-employment rights; extension of federal workman's compensation coverage and increase of benefits; legislative assurance of safety standards for longshore and harbor workers and for the transportation of migratory workers; an increase of railroad workers retirement and disability benefits. seven past years of accomplishments, however, are but a base to build upon in fostering, promoting and improving the welfare of america's working men and women, both organized and unorganized. we pledge, therefore, action on these constructive lines: diligent administration of the amended labor-management relations act of (taft-hartley act) and the labor-management reporting and disclosure act of (landrum-griffin act) with recommendations for improvements which experience shows are needed to make them more effective or remove any inequities. correction of defects in the welfare and pension plans disclosure act to protect employees' and beneficiaries' interests. upward revision in amount and extended coverage of the minimum wage to several million more workers. strengthening the unemployment insurance system and extension of its benefits. improvement of the eight-hour laws relating to hours and overtime compensation on federal and federally-assisted construction, and continued vigorous enforcement and improvement of minimum wage laws for federal supply and construction contracts. continued improvement of manpower skills and training to meet a new era of challenges, including action programs to aid older workers, women, youth, and the physically handicapped. encouragement of training programs by labor, industry and government to aid in finding new jobs for persons dislocated by automation or other economic changes. improvement of job opportunities and working conditions of migratory farm workers. assurance of equal pay for equal work regardless of sex, encouragement of programs to insure on-the-job safety, and encouragement of the states to improve their labor standards legislation, and to improve veterans employment rights and benefits. encouragement abroad of free democratic institutions, higher living standards and higher wages through such agencies as the international labor organization, and cooperation with the free trade union movement in strengthening free labor throughout the world. agriculture aamericans are the best-fed and the best-clothed people in the world. our challenge fortunately is one of dealing with abundance, not overcoming shortage. the fullness of our fields, forests and grazing lands is an important advantage in our struggle against worldwide tyranny and our crusade against poverty. our farmers have provided us with a powerful weapon in the ideological and economic struggle in which we are now engaged. yet, far too many of our farm families, the source of this strength, have not received a fair return for their labors. for too long, democratic-controlled congresses have stalemated progress by clinging to obsolete programs conceived for different times and different problems. promises of specific levels of price support or a single type of program for all agriculture are cruel deceptions based upon the pessimistic pretense that only with rigid controls can farm families be aided. the republican party will provide within the framework of individual freedom a greater bargaining power to assure an equitable return for the work and capital supplied by farmers. the republican party pledges itself to develop new programs to improve and stabilize farm family income. it recognizes two main challenges the immediate one of utilizing income-depressing surpluses and the long-range one of steady balanced growth and development with a minimum of federal interference and control. to utilize immediately surpluses in an orderly manner, with a minimum impact on domestic and foreign markets, we pledge: intensification of the food for peace program, including new cooperative efforts among food surplus nations to assist the hungry peoples in less favored areas of the world. payment-in-kind, out of existing surpluses, as part of our land retirement program. creation of a strategic food reserve properly dispersed in forms which can be preserved for long periods against the contingency of grave national emergency. strengthened efforts to distribute surpluses to schools and low-income and needy citizens of our own country. a reorganization of commodity credit corporation's inventory management operations to reduce competition with the marketings of farmers. to assure steady balanced growth and agricultural progress, we pledge: a crash research program to develop industrial and other uses of farm products. use of price supports at levels best fitted to specific commodities, in order to widen markets, ease production controls, and help achieve increased farm family income. acceleration of production adjustments, including a large scale land conservation reserve program on a voluntary and equitable rental basis, with full consideration of the impact on local communities. continued progress in the wise use and conservation of water and soil resources. use of marketing agreements and orders, and other marketing devices, when approved by producers, to assist in the orderly marketing of crops, thus enabling farmers to strengthen their bargaining power. stepped-up research to reduce production costs and to cut distribution costs. strengthening of the educational programs of the u.s. department of agriculture and the land-grant institutions. improvement of credit facilities for financing the capital needs of modern farming. encouragement of farmer owned and operated cooperatives including rural electric and telephone facilities. expansion of the rural development program to help low-income farm families not only through better farming methods, but also through opportunities for vocational training, more effective employment services, and creation of job opportunities through encouragement of local industrialization. continuation and further improvement of the great plains program. legislative action for programs now scheduled to expire for the school milk program, wool, and sugar, including increased sugar acreage to domestic areas. free movement in interstate commerce of agricultural commodities meeting federal health standards. to prevent dumping of agricultural imports upon domestic markets. to assure the american farmer a more direct voice in his own destiny, we pledge: to select an official committee of farmers and ranchers, on a regional basis, broadly representative of american agriculture, whose function will be to recommend to the president guidelines for improving the operation of government farm programs. natural resources a strong and growing economy requires vigorous and persistent attention to wise conservation and sound development of all our resources. team work between federal, state and private entities is essential and should be continued. it has resulted in sustained conservation and resource development programs on a scale unmatched in our history. the past seven years of republican leadership have seen the development of more power capacity flood-control irrigation fish and wildlife projects, recreational facilities, and associated multipurpose benefits than during any previous administration in history. the proof is visable in the forests and waters of the land and in republican initiation of and support of the upper watershed program and the small reclamation projects act. it is clear, also, in the results of continuing administration encouraged forest management practices which have brought, for the first time, a favorable balance between the growth and cutting of america's trees. our objective is for further growth, greater strength, and increased utilization in each great area of resource use and development. we pledge: use of the community watershed as the basic natural unit through which water resource, soil, and forest management programs may best be developed, with interstate compacts encouraged to handle regional aspects without federal domination. development of new water resource projects throughout the nation. support of the historic policy of congress in preserving the integrity of the several states to govern water rights. continued federal support for republican-initiated research and demonstration projects which will supply fresh water from salt and brackish water sources. necessary measures for preservation of our domestic fisheries. continued forestry conservation with appropriate sustained yield harvesting, thus increasing jobs for people and increasing revenue. to observe the ""preference clause"" in marketing federal power. support of the basic principles of reclamation. recognition of urban and industrial demands by making available to states and local governments, federal lands not needed for national programs. full use and preservation of our great outdoors are pledged in: completion of the ""mission "" for the improvement of national park areas as well as sponsorship of a new ""mission "" program to encourage establishment and rehabilitation of local, state, and regional parks, to provide adequate recreational facilities for our expanding population. continued support of the effort to keep our great out-of doors beautiful, green, and clean. establishment of a citizens board of conservation, resource and land management experts to inventory those federal lands now set aside for a particular purpose to study the future needs of the nation for parks, seashores, and wildlife and other recreational areas, and to study the possibility of restoring lands not needed for a federal program. minerals, metals, fuels, also call for carefully considered actions in view of the repeated failure of democratic-controlled congresses to enact any long-range minerals legislation. republicans, therefore pledge: long-range minerals and fuels planning and programming, including increased coal research. assistance to mining industries in bridging the gap between peak defense demands and anticipated peacetime demands. continued support for federal financial assistance and incentives under our tax laws to encourage exploration for domestic sources of minerals and metals, with reasonable depletion allowances. to preserve our fish and wildlife heritage, we pledge: legislation to authorize exchange of lands between state and federal governments to adapt programs to changing uses and habits. vigorous implementation of long-range programs for fish and wildlife. government finance to build a better america with broad national purposes such as high employment, vigorous and steady economic growth, and a dependable currency, responsible management of our federal finances is essential. even more important, a sound economy is vital to national security. while leading democrats charge us with a ""budget balancing"" mentality, their taunts really reflect their frustration over the people's recognition that as a nation we must live within our means. government that is careless with the money of its citizens is careless with their future. because we are concerned about the well-being of people, we are concerned about protecting the value of their money. to this end, we republicans believe that: every government expenditure must be tested by its contribution to the general welfare, not to any narrow interest group. except in times of war or economic adversity, expenditures should be covered by revenues. we must work persistently to reduce, not to increase, the national debt, which imposes a heavy economic burden on every citizen. our tax structure should be improved to provide greater incentives to economic progress, to make it fair and equitable, and to maintain and deserve public acceptance. we must resist assaults upon the independence of the federal reserve system, we must strengthen, not weaken, the ability of the federal reserve system and the treasury department to exercise effective control over money and credit in order better to combat both deflation and inflation that retard economic growth and shrink people's savings and earnings. in order of priority, federal revenues should be used, first, to meet the needs of national security, second, to fulfill the legitimate and urgent needs of the nation that cannot be met by the states, local governments or private action third, to pay down on the national debt in good times, finally, to improve our tax structure. national security and other essential needs will continue to make enormous demands upon public revenues. it is therefore imperative that we weigh carefully each demand for a new federal expenditure. the federal government should undertake not the most things nor the least things, but the right things. achieving this vital purpose demands: that congress, in acting on new spending bills, have figures before it showing the cumulative effect of its actions on the total budget. that spending commitments for future years be clearly listed in each budget, so that the effect of built-in expenditure programs may be recognized and evaluated. that the president be empowered to veto individual items in authorization and appropriation bills. that increasing efforts be made to extend business-like methods to government operations particularly in purchasing and supply activities, and in personnel. government administration the challenges of our time test the very organization of democracy. they put on trial the capacity of free government to act quickly, wisely, resolutely. to meet these challenges: the president must continue to be able to reorganize and streamline executive operations to keep the executive branch capable of responding effectively to rapidly changing conditions in both foreign and domestic fields. the eisenhower-nixon sdministration did so by creating a new department of health, education and welfare, by establishing the national aeronautics and space agency and the federal aviation agency, and by reorganizations of the defense department. two top positions should be established to assist the president in, () the entire field of national security and international affairs, and, () governmental planning and management, particularly in domestic affairs. we must undertake further reorganization of the defense department to achieve the most effective unification of defense planning and command. improved conflict-of-interest laws should be enacted for vigilant protection of the public interest and to remove deterrents to governmental service by our most able citizens. the federal government must constantly strengthen its career service and must be truly progesssive as an employer. government employment must be a vocation deserving of high public respect. common sense demands continued improvements in employment, training and promotion practices based on merit, effective procedures for dealing with employment grievances, and salaries which are comparable to those offered by private employers. as already practiced by the republican membership, responsible policy committees should be elected by each party in each house of congress. this would provide a mechanism for meetings of party congressional leaders with the president when circumstances demand. needed federal judgeships, appointed on the basis of the highest qualifications and without limitation to a single political party, should be created to expedite administration of justice in federal courts. the remarkable growth of the post office since to serve an additional nine million urban and one and one-half million farm families must be continued. the post office must be continually improved and placed on a self-sustaining basis. progressive republican policies of the past seven years have resulted in reduced costs, decentralization of postal operations, liberal pay, fringe benefits, improved working conditions, streamlined management, and improved service. vigorous state and local governments are a vital part of our federal union. the federal government should leave to state and local governments those programs and problems which they can best handle and tax sources adequate to finance them. we must continue to improve liaison between federal, state and local government. we believe that the federal government, when apporpriate, should render significant assistance in dealing with our urgent problems of urban growth and change. no vast new bureaucracy is needed to achieve this objective. we favor a change in the electoral college system to give every voter a fair voice in presidential elections. we condemn bigotry, smear and other unfair tactics in political campaigns. we favor realistic and effective safeguards against diverting non-political funds to partisan political purposes. republicans will continue to work for congressional representation and self-government for the district of columbia and also support the constitutional amendment granting suffrage in national elections. we support the right of the puerto rican people to achieve statehood, whenever they freely so determine. we support the right of the people of the virgin islands to an elected governor national representation and suffrage, looking toward eventual statehood, when qualified. we also support the right of the people of guam to an elected governor and national representation. these pledges are meaningful from the republican leadership under which alaska and hawaii have newly entered the union. congress should submit a constitutional amendment providing equal rights for women. education the rapid pace of international developments serves to re emphasisize dramatically the challenge which generations of americans will face in the years ahead. we are reminded daily of the crucial importance of strengthening our system of education to prepare our youth for understanding and shaping the powerful emerging forces of the modern world and to permit the fullest possible development of individual capacities and potentialities. we express our greatefulness and we praise the countless thousands of teachers who have devoted themselves in an inspired way towards the development of our greatest heritage, our own children, the youth of the country. education is not a luxury, nor a gift to be bestowed upon ourselves and our children. education is an investment our schools cannot become second best. each person possesses the right to education, it is his birthright in a free republic. primary responsibility for education must remain with the local community and state. the federal government should assist selectively in strengthening education without interfering with full local control of schools. one objective of such federal assistance should be to help equalize educational opportunities. under the eisenhower-nixon administration, the federal government will spend more than a billion dollars in to strengthen american education. we commend the objective of the republican administration in sponsoring the national defense education act to stimulate improvement of study and teaching in selected fields at the local level. toward the goal of fullest possible educational opportunity for every american, we pledge these actions: federal support to the primary and secondary schools by a program of federal aid for school construction, pacing it to the real needs of individual school districts in states and territories, and requiring state approval and participation. stimulation of actions designed to update and strengthen vocational education for both youth and adults. support of efforts to make adequate library facilities available to all our citizens. continued support of programs to strengthen basic research in education to discover the best methods for helping handicapped, retarded, and gifted children to realize their highest potential. the federal government can also play a part in stimulating higher education. constructive action would include: the federal program to assist in construction of college housing. extension of the federal student loan program and graduate fellowship program. consideration of means through tax laws to help offset tuition costs. continued support of the east-west center for cultural and technical interchange in hawaii for the purpose of strengthening our relationship with the peoples of the pacific world. federal matching grants to help states finance the cost of state surveys and inventories of the status and needs of their school systems. provision should be made for continuous attention to education at all levels by the creation of a permanent, top-level commission to advise the president and the secretary of health, education and welfare, constantly striving to focus the interest of each citizen on the quality of our education at every level, from primary through post-graduate, and for every age group from children to adults. we are aware of the fact that there is a temporary shortage of classrooms for our elementary and secondary schools in a limited number of states. but this shortage, due to the vigilant action of state legislatures and local school boards, is not increasing, but is decreasing. we shall use our full efforts in all the states of the union to have these legislatures and school boards augment their present efforts to the end that this temporary shortage may be eliminated and that every child in this country shall have the opportunity to obtain a good education. the respective states as a permanent program can shoulder this long standing and cherished responsibility easier than can the federal government with its heavy indebtedness. we believe moreover that any large plan of federal aid to education, such as direct contributions to or grants for teachers salaries can only lead ultimately to federal domination and control of our schools to which we are unalterably opposed. in the words of president eisenhower, ""education best fulfills its high purpose when responsibility for education is kept close to the people it serves, when it is rooted in the homes, nurtured in the community and sustained by a rich variety of public, private and individual resources. the bond linking home and school and community, the responsiveness of each to the needs of the other is a precious asset of american education"". science and technology much of america's future depends upon the inquisitive mind, freely searching nature for ways to conquer disease, poverty and grinding physical demands, and for knowledge of space and the atom. we republicans express our profound gratitude to the great scientists and engineers of our country, both in and out of government, for the remarkable progress they have made. reliable evidence indicates, all areas of scientific knowledge considered, that our country has been, is, and under our system of free inquiry, will continue to be the greatest arsenal and reservoir of effective scientific knowledge in the world. we pledge our continued leadership in every field of science and technology, earthbound as well as spacial, to assure a citadel of liberty from which the fruits of freedom may be carried to all people. our continuing and great national need is basic research, a wellspring of knowledge and progress. government must continue to take a responsible role in science to assure that worthwhile endeavors of national significance are not retarded by practical limitations of private and local support. this demands from all americans the intellectual leadership and understanding so necessary for these creative endeavors and an equal understanding by our scientists and technicians of the needs and hopes of mankind. we believe the federal roles in research to be in the area of () basic research which industry can not be reasonably expected to pursue, and () applied research in fields of prime national concern such as national defense, exploration and use of space, public health, and better common use of all natural resources, both human and physical. we endorse the contracting by government agencies for research and urge allowance for reasonable charges for overhead and management in connection therewith. the vigor of american science and technology may best be inspired by: an environment of freedom and public understanding in which intellectual achievement and scientific research may flourish. a decentralization of research into as many centers of creativity as possible. the encouragement of colleges and universities, private enterprise, and foundations as a growing source of new ideas and new applications. opportunity for scientists and engineers, in and out of government, to pursue their search with utmost aggressiveness. continuation of the advisory committee to represent the views of the scientific community to the president and of the federal council for science and technology to foster coordination in planning and execution. continued expansion of the eisenhower-nixon atoms-for-peace program and a constant striving, backed by scientific advice, for international agreement for peaceful and cooperative exploration and use of space. human needs the ultimate objective of our free society and of an ever growing economy is to enable the individual to pursue a life of dignity and to devolop his own capacities to his maximum potential. government's primary role is to help provide the environment within which the individual can seek his own goals. in some areas this requires federal action to supplement individual, local and state initiative. the republican party has acted and will act decisively, compassionately, and with deep human understanding in approaching such problems as those of the aged, the infirm, the mentally ill, and the needy. this is demonstrated by the significant increase in social security coverage and benefits as a result of recommendations made by the eisenhower-nixon administration. as a result of these recommendations and normal growth, million persons are receiving benefits today compared to five million in , and benefit payments total ten and one-third billion dollars as compared to two and one-half billion dollars in . in addition, there have been increases in payments to those on public assistance, both for their basic needs and for their health and medical care and a broad expansion in our federal-state program for restoring disabled persons to useful lives, an expansion which has accomplished the rehabilitation of over half a million persons during this administration. new needs, however, are constantly arising in our highly complex, interdependent, and urbanized society. older citizens to meet the needs of the aging, we pledge: expansion of coverage, and liberalization of selected social security benefits on a basis which would maintain the fiscal integrity of the system. support of federal-state grant programs to improve health, welfare and rehabilitation services for the handicapped older persons and to improve standards of nursing home care and care and treatment facilities for the chronically and mentally ill. federal leadership to encourage policies that will make retirement at a fixed age voluntary and not compulsory. support of programs that will persuade and encourage the nation to utilize fully the skills, wisdom and experience of older citizens. prompt consideration of recommendations by the white house conference on aging called by the president for january, . health aid development of a health program that will provide the aged needing it, on a sound fiscal basis and through a contributory system, protection against burdensome costs of health care. such a program should: provide the beneficiaries with the option of purchasing private health insurance, a vital distinction between our approach and democratic proposals in that it would encourage commercial carriers and voluntary insurance organizations to continue their efforts to develop sound coverage plans for the senior population. protect the personal relationship of patient and physician. include state participation. for the needs which individuals of all age groups cannot meet by themselves, we propose: removing the arbitary year age requirement under the disability insurance program while amending the law also to provide incentives for rehabilitated persons to return to useful work. a single, federal assistance grant to each state for aid to needy persons rather than dividing such grants into specific categories. a strengthened federal state program to rehabilitate the estimated , persons who annually could become independent after proper medical services and occupational training. a new federal state program, for handicapped persons completely dependent on others, to help them meet their needs for personal care. juvenile delinquency the federal government can and should help state and local communities combat juvenile delinquency by inaugurating a grant program for research, demonstration, and training projects and by placing greater emphasis on strengthening family life in all welfare programs for which it shares responsibility. veterans we believe that military service in the defense of our republic against aggressors who have sought to destroy the freedom and dignity of man imposes upon the nation a special responsibility to those who have served. to meet this responsibility, we pledge: continuance of the veterans administration as an independent agency. the highest possible standard of medical care with increasing emphasis on rehabilitation. indian affairs as recently as thirty percent of indian school age children were unable to obtain an education. through republican efforts, this fall, for the first time in history, every eligible indian child will be able to attend an elementary school. having accomplished this, we will now accelerate our efforts to open up both secondary and higher education opportunities for every qualified indian youth. as a result of a stepped up health program there has been a marked decrease in death rates from tuberculosis and in the infant mortality rate. also substantial progress has been made in the modernization of health facilities. we pledge continued progress in this area. we are opposed to precipitous termination of the federal indian trusteeship responsibility, and pledge not to support any termination plan for any tribe which has not approved such action. housing despite noteworthy accomplishments, stubborn and deep-seated problems stand in the way of achieving the national objective of a decent home in a suitable environment for every american. recognizing that the federal government must help provide the economic climate and incentives which make this objective obtainable, the republican party will vigorously support the following steps, all designed to supplement and not supplant private initiative. continued effort to clear slums, and promote rebuilding, rehabilitation, and conservation of our cities. new programs to stimulate development of specialized types of housing, such as those for the elderly and for nursing homes. a program of research and demonstration aimed at finding ways to reduce housing costs, including support of efforts to modernize and improve local building codes. adequate authority for the federal housing agencies to assist the flow of mortgage credit into private housing, with emphasis on homes for middle-income and lower-income families and including assistance in urban residential areas. a stepped up program to assist in urban planning, designed to assure far-sighted and wise use of land and to coordinate mass transportation and other vital facilities in our metropolitan areas. health there has been a five-fold increase in government assisted medical research during the last six years. we pledge: continued federal support for a sound research program aimed at both the prevention and cure of diseases, and intensified efforts to secure prompt and effective application of the results of research. this will include emphasis on mental illness. support of international health research programs. we face serious personnel shortages in the health and medical fields. we pledge: federal help in new programs to build schools of medicine, dentistry, and public health and nursing, and financial aid to students in those fields. we are confronted with major problems in the field of environmental health. we pledge: strengthened federal enforcement powers in combatting water pollution and additional resources for research and demonstration projects. federal grants for the construction of waste disposal plants should be made only when they make an identifiable contribution to clearing up polluted streams. federal authority to identify, after appropriate hearings, air pollution problems and to recommend proposed solutions. additional resources for research and training in the field of radiological medicine. protection of consumers in safeguarding the health of the nation the eisenhower-nixon administration's initiative has resulted in doubling the resources of the food and drug administration and in giving it new legal weapons. more progress has been made during this period in protecting consumers against harmful food, drugs, and cosmetics than in any other time in our history. we will continue to give strong support to this consumer-protection program. civil rights this nation was created to give expression, validity and purpose to our spiritual heritage, the supreme worth of the individual. in such a nation, a nation dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal, racial discrimination has no place. it can hardly be reconciled with a constitution that guarantees equal protection under law to all persons. in a deeper sense, too, it is immoral and unjust. as to those matters within reach of political action and leadership, we pledge ourselves unreservedly to its eradication. equality under law promises more than the equal right to vote and transcends mere relief from discrimination by government. it becomes a reality only when all persons have equal opportunity, without distinction of race, religion, color or national origin, to acquire the essentials of life, housing, education and employment. the republican party, the party of abraham lincoln from its very beginning has striven to make this promise a reality. it is today, as it was then, unequivocally dedicated to making the greatest amount of progress toward the objective. we recognize that discrimination is not a problem localized in one area of the country, but rather a problem that must be faced by north and south alike. nor is discrimination confined to the discrimination against negroes. discrimination in many, if not all, areas of the country on the basis of creed or national origin is equally insidious. further we recognize that in many communities in which a century of custom and tradition must be overcome heartening and commendable progress has been made. the republican party is proud of the civil rights record of the eisenhower administration. more progress has been made during the past eight years than in the preceding years. we acted promptly to end discrimination in our nation's capital. vigorous executive action was taken to complete swiftly the desegregation of the armed forces, veterans hospitals, navy yards, and other federal establishments. we supported the position of the negro school children before the supreme court. we believe the supreme court school decision should be carried out in accordance with the mandate of the court. although the democratic-controlled congress watered them down the republican administration's recommendations resulted in significant and effective civil rights legislation in both and the first civil rights statutes to be passed in more than years. hundreds of negroes have already been registered to vote as a result of department of justice action, some in counties where negroes did not vote before. the new law will soon make it possible for thousands and thousands of negroes previously disenfranchised to vote. by executive order, a committee for the elimination of discrimination in government employment has been reestablished with broadened authority. today, nearly one-fourth of all federal employees are negro. the president's committee on government contracts under the chairmanship of vice-president nixon has become an impressive force for the elimination of discriminatory employment practices of private companies that do business with the government. other important achievements include initial steps toward the elimination of segregation in federally aided housing the establishment of the civil rights division of the department of justice, which enforces federal civil rights laws and the appointment of the bi-partisan civil rights commission which has prepared a significant report that lays the groundwork for further legislative action and progress. the republican record is a record of progress not merely promises. nevertheless, we recognize that much remains to be done. each of the following pledges is practical and within realistic reach of accomplishment. they are serious, not cynical pledges made to result in maximum progress. . voting. we pledge: continued vigorous enforcement of the civil rights laws to guarantee the right to vote to all citizens in all areas of the country. legislation to provide that the completion of six primary grades in a state accredited school is conclusive evidence of literacy for voting purposes. . public schools. we pledge: the department of justice will continue its vigorous support of court orders for school desegregation. desegregation suits now pending involve at least school districts. those suits and others already concluded will effect most major cities in which school segregation is being practiced. it will use the new authority provided by the civil rights act of to prevent obstruction of court orders. we will propose legislation to authorize the attorney general to bring actions for school desegregation in the name of the united states in appropriate cases as when economic coercion or threat of physical harm is used to deter persons from going to court to establish their rights. our continuing support of the president's proposal, to extend federal aid and technical assistance to schools which in good faith attempted to desegregate. we oppose the pretense of fixing a target date three years from now for the mere submission of plans for school desegregation. slow moving school districts would construe it as a three year moratorium during which progress would cease, postponing until the legal process to enforce compliance. we believe that each of the pending court actions should proceed as the supreme court has directed and that in no district should there be any such delay. . employment. we pledge: continued support for legislation to establish a commission on equal job opportunity to make permanent and to expand with legislative backing the excellent work being performed by the president's committee on government contracts. appropirate legislation to end the discriminatory membership practices are eradicated promptly by the labor unions themselves. use of the full-scale review of existing state laws, and of prior proposals for federal legislation, to eliminate discrimination in employment now being conducted by the civil rights commission, for guidance in our objective of developing a federal-state program in the employment area. special consideration of training programs aimed at developing the skills of those now working in marginal agricultural employment so that they can obtain employment in industry, notably in the new industries moving into the south. . housing. we pledge: action to prohibit discrimination in housing constructed with the aid of federal subsidies. . public facilities and services. we pledge: removal of any vestige of discrimination in the operation of federal facilities or procedures which may at any time be found. opposition to the use of federal funds for the construction of segregated community facilities. action to ensure that public transportation and other government authorized services shall be free from segregation. . legislative procedure. we pledge: our best efforts to change present rule of the senate and other appropriate congressional procedures that often make unattainable proper legislative implementation of consititutional guarantees. we reaffirm the constitutional right to peaceable assembly to protect discrimination in private business establishments. we applaud the action of the businessmen who have abandoned discriminatory practices in retail establishments, and we urge others to follow their example. finally we recognize that civil rights is a responsibility not only of states and localities it is a national problem and a national responsibility. the federal government should take the initiative in promoting inter-group conferences among those who, in their communities, are earnestly seeking solutions of the complex problems of desegregation to the end that closed channels of communication may be opened, tensions eased, and a cooperative solution of local problems may be sought. in summary, we pledge the full use of the power, resources and leadership of the federal government to eliminate discrimination based on race, color, religion or national origin and to encourage understanding and good will among all races and creeds. immigration immigration has historically been a great factor in the growth of the united states not only in numbers but in the enrichment of ideas that immigrants have brought with them. this republican administration has given refuge to over , victims of communist tyranny from hungary, ended needless delay in processing applications for naturalization, and has urged other enlightened legislation to liberalize existing restrictions. immigration has been reduced to the point where it does not provide the stimulus to growth that it should, nor are we fulfilling our obligation as a haven for the oppressed. republican conscience and republican policy require that: the annual number of immigrants we accept be at least doubled. obsolete immigration laws be ammended by abandoning the outdated census data as a base and substituting the census. the guidelines of our immigration policy be based upon judgment of the individual merit of each applicant for admission and citizenship. conclusion we have set forth the program of the republican party for the government of the united states. we have written a party document as is our duty but we have tried to refrain from writing a merely partisan document. we have no wish to exaggerate differences between ourselves and the democratic party nor can we, in conscience, obscure the differences that do exist. we believe that the republican program is based upon a sounder understanding of the action and scope of government. there are many things a free government cannot do for its people as well as they can do themselves. there are some things no government should promise or attempt to do. the functions of government are so great as to bear no needless enlargement. we limit our proposals and our pledges to those areas for which the government of a great republic can reasonably be made responsible. to the best of our ability we have avoided advocating measures that would go against the grain of a free people. the history and composition of the republican party make it the natural instrument for eradicating the injustice and discrimination in this country. we republicans are fortunate in being able to contend against these evils, without having to contend against each other for the principle. we believe that we see, so far as men can see through the obscurity of time and trouble, the prudent course for the nation in its hour of trial. the soviet union has created another of the new situations of peril which has been the communist record from the beginning and will continue to be until our strategy for victory has succeeded. the speed of technological change makes it imperative that we measure the new situations by their special requirements and accelerate as appropriate our efforts in every direction, economic and military and political to deal with them. as rapidly as we perfect the new generations of weapons we must arm ourselves effectively and without delay. in this respect the nation stands now at one of the new points of departure. we must never allow our technology, particularly in nuclear and propulsion fields, to lag for any reason until such time as we have dependable and honest safeguards of inspection and control. we must take steps at once to secure our position in this regard and at the same time we must intensify our efforts to develop better safeguards in the field of disarmament. the free nations of the world must ever be rallied to the cause and be encouraged to join together in more effective alliances and unions strong enough to meet all challenges and sustain the common effort. it is urgent that we innovate to keep the initiative for our free cause. we offer toil and sweat, to ward off blood and tears. we advocate an immovable resistance against every communist aggression. we argue for a military might commensurate with our universal tasks. we end by declaring our faith in the republic and in its people, and in the deathless principles of right from which it draws its moral force.","['preamble', 'united', 'states', 'living', 'age', 'profoundest', 'revolution', 'lives', 'men', 'nations', 'undergoing', 'transformations', 'history',

Democratic Party,1960,1960,dem_1960.csv,CSV,"In 1796, in America's first contested national election, our Party, under the leadership of Thomas Jefferson, campaigned on the principles of ""The Rights of Man"". Ever since, these four words have underscored our identity with the plain people of America and the world. In periods of national crises we Democrats have returned to these words for renewed strength. We return to them today. In 1960, ""The Rights of Man"" are still the issue. It is our continuing responsibility to provide an effective instrument of political action for every American who seeks to strengthen these rights everywhere here in America, and everywhere in our 20th Century world. The common danger of mankind is war and the threat of war. Today, three billion human beings live in fear that some rash act or blunder may plunge us all into a nuclear holocaust which will leave only ruined cities, blasted homes, and a poisoned earth and sky. Our objective, however, is not the right to coexist in armed camps on the same planet with totalitarian ideologies it is the creation of an enduring peace in which the universal values of human dignity, truth, and justice under law are finally secured for all men everywhere on earth. If America is to work effectively for such a peace, we must first restore our national strength--military, political, economic, and moral. NATIONAL DEFENSE The new Democratic Administration will recast our military capacity in order to provide forces and weapons of a diversity, balance, and mobility sufficient in quantity and quality to deter both limited and general aggressions. When the Democratic Administration left office in 1953 the United States was the pre-eminent power in the world. Most free nations had confidence in our will and our ability to carry out our commitments to the common defense. Even those who wished us ill respected our power and influence. The Republican Administration has lost that position of pre eminence. Over the past seven and one-half years, our military power has steadily declined relative to that of the Russians and the Chinese and their satellites. This is not a partisan election-year charge. it has been persistently made by high officials of the Republican Administration itself. Before Congressional committees they have testified that the Communists will have a dangerous lead in intercontinental missiles through 1963 and that the Republican Administration has no plans to catch up. They have admitted that the Soviet Union leads in the space race and that they have no plans to catch up. They have also admitted that our conventional military forces, on which we depend for defense in any non-nuclear war, have been dangerously slashed for reasons of ""economy"" and that they have no plans to reverse this trend. As a result, our military position today is measured in terms of gaps, missile gap, space gap, limited-war gap. To recover from the errors of the past seven and one-half years will not be easy. This is the strength that must be erected: 1. Deterrent military power such that the Soviet and Chinese leaders will have no doubt that an attack on the United States would surely be followed by their own destruction. 2. Balanced conventional military forces which will permit a response graded to the intensity of any threats of aggressive force. 3. Continuous modernization of these forces through intensified research and development, including essential programs now slowed down, terminated, suspended, or neglected for lack of budgetary support. A first order of business of a Democratic Administration will be a complete re-examination of the organization of our armed forces. A military organization structure, conceived before the revolution in weapons technology, cannot be suitable for the strategic deterrent, continental defense, limited war, and military alliance requirements of the nineteen sixties. We believe that our armed forces should be organized more nearly on the basis of function, not only to produce greater military strength, but also to eliminate duplication and save substantial sums. We pledge our will, energies and resources to oppose Communist aggression. Since World War II it has been clear that our own security must be pursued in concert with that of many other nations. The Democratic Administrations which in World War II led in forging a mighty and victorious alliance, took the initiative after the war in creating the North Atlantic Treaty Organization-- the greatest peacetime alliance in history. This alliance has made it possible to keep Western Europe and the Atlantic Community secure against Communist pressures. Our present system of alliances was begun in a time of an earlier weapons technology when our ability to retaliate against Communist attack required bases all around the periphery of the Soviet Union. Today, because of our continuing weakness in mobile weapons systems and intercontinental missiles, our defenses still depend in part on bases beyond our borders for planes and shorter range missiles. If an alliance is to be maintained in vigor, its unity must be reflected in shared purposes. Some of our allies have contributed neither devotion to the cause of freedom nor any real military strength. The new Democratic Administration will review our system of pacts and alliances. We shall continue to adhere to our treaty obligations, including the commitment of the UN Charter to resist aggression. But we shall also seek to shift the emphasis of our cooperation from military aid to economic development, wherever this is possible. Civil Defense We commend the work of the civil defense groups throughout the nation. A strong and effective civil defense is an essential element in our nation's defense. The new Democratic Administration will undertake a full review and analysis of the programs that should be adopted if the protection possible is to be provided to the civilian population of our nation. ARMS CONTROL A fragile power balance sustained by mutual nuclear terror does not, however, constitute peace. We must regain the initiative on the entire international front with effective new policies to create the conditions for peace. There are no simple solutions to the infinitely complex challenges which face us. Mankind's eternal dream, a world of peace, can only be built slowly and patiently. A primary task is to develop responsible proposals that will help break the deadlock on arms control. Such proposals should include means for ending nuclear tests under workable safeguards, cutting back nuclear weapons, reducing conventional forces, preserving outer space for peaceful purposes, preventing surprise attack, and limiting the risk of accidental war. This requires a national peace agency for disarmament planning and research to muster the scientific ingenuity, coordination, continuity, and seriousness of purpose which are now lacking in our arms control efforts. The national peace agency would develop the technical and scientific data necessary for serious disarmament negotiations, would conduct research in cooperation with the Defense Department and Atomic Energy Commission on methods of inspection and monitoring arms control agreements particularly agreements to control nuclear testing, and would provide continuous technical advice to our disarmament negotiators. As with armaments, so with disarmaments, the Republican Administration has provided us with much talk but little constructive action. Representatives of the United States have gone to conferences without plans or preparation. The Administration has played opportunistic politics, both at home and abroad. Even during the recent important negotiations at Geneva and Paris, only a handful of people were devoting full time to work on the highly complex problem of disarmament. More than 100 billion dollars of the world's production now goes each year into armaments. To the extent that we can secure the adoption of effective arms control agreements, vast resources will be freed for peaceful use. The new Democratic Administration will plan for an orderly shift of our expenditures. Long-delayed reductions in excise, corporation, and individual income taxes will then be possible. We can also step-up the pace in meeting our backlog of public needs and in pursuing the promise of atomic and space science in a peaceful age. As world-wide disarmament proceeds, it will free vast resources for a new international attack on the problem of world poverty. THE INSTRUMENTS OF FOREIGN POLICY American foreign policy in all its aspects must be attuned to our world of change. We will recruit officials whose experience, humanity, and dedication fit them for the task of effectively representing America abroad. We will provide a more sensitive and creative direction to our overseas information program. And we will overhaul our administrative machinery so that America may avoid diplomatic embarrassments and at long last speak with a single confident voice in world affairs. The ""Image"" of America First, those men and women selected to represent us abroad must be chosen for their sensitive understanding of the peoples with whom they will live. We can no longer afford representatives who are ignorant of the language and culture and politics of the nations in which they represent us. Our information programs must be more than news broadcasts and boastful recitals of our accomplishments and our material riches. We must find ways to show the people of the world that we share the same goals dignity health freedom schools for children a place in the sun and that we will work together to achieve them. Our program of visits between Americans and people of other nations will be expanded, with special emphasis upon students and younger leaders. We will encourage study of foreign languages. We favor continued support and extension of such programs as the East-West cultural center established at the University of Hawaii. We shall study a similar center for Latin America with due consideration of the existing facilities now available in the Canal Zone. National Policy Machinery In the present administration, the National Security Council has been used not to focus issues for decision by the responsible leaders of Government, but to paper over problems of policy with ""agreed solutions"" which avoid decisions. The mishandling of the U-2 espionage flights, the sorry spectacle of official denial, retraction, and contradiction and the admitted misjudging of japanese public opinion are only two recent examples of the breakdown of the Administration's machinery for assembling facts, making decisions, and coordinating action. The Democratic Party welcomes the study now being made by the Senate Subcommittee on National Policy Machinery. The new Democratic Administration will revamp and simplify this cumbersome machinery. WORLD TRADE World trade is more than ever essential to world peace. In the tradition of Cordell Hull, we shall expand world trade in every responsible way. Since all Americans share the benefits of this policy, its costs should not be the burden of a few. We shall support practical measures to ease the necessary adjustments of industries and communities which may be unavoidably hurt by increases in imports. World trade raises living standards, widens markets, reduces costs, increases profits, and builds political stability and international economic cooperation. However, the increase in foreign imports involves costly adjustment and damage to some domestic industries and communities. The burden has been heavier recently because of the Republican failure to maintain an adequate rate of economic growth, and the refusal to use public programs to ease necessary adjustments. The Democratic Administration will help industries affected by foreign trade with measures favorable to economic growth, orderly transition, fair competition, and the long-run economic strength of all parts of our nation. Industries and communities affected by foreign trade need and deserve appropriate help through trade adjustment measures such as direct loans, tax incentives, defense contracts priority, and retraining assistance. Our Government should press for reduction of foreign barriers to the sale of the products of American industry and agriculture. These are particularly severe in the case of fruit products. The present balance-of-payments situation provides a favorable opportunity for such action. The new Democratic Administration will seek international agreements to assure fair competition and fair labor standards to protect our own workers and to improve the lot of workers elsewhere. Our domestic economic policies and our essential foreign policies must be harmonious. To sell, we must buy. We therefore must resist the temptation to accept remedies that deny American producers and consumers access to world markets and destroy the prosperity of our friends in the non-Communist world. IMMIGRATION We shall adjust our immigration, nationality and refugee policies to eliminate discrimination and to enable members of scattered families abroad to be united with relatives already in our midst. The national-origins quota system of limiting immigration contradicts the founding principles of this nation. It is inconsistent with our belief in the rights of man. This system was instituted after World War I as a policy of deliberate discrimination by a Republican Administration and Congress. The revision of immigration and nationality laws we seek will implement our belief that enlightened immigration, naturalization and refugee policies and humane administration of them are important aspects of our foreign policy. These laws will bring greater skills to our land reunite families permit the United States to meet its fair share of world programs of rescue and rehabilitation, and take advantage of immigration as an important factor in the growth of the American economy. In this World Refugee Year it is our hope to achieve admission of our fair share of refugees. We will institute policies to alleviate suffering among the homeless wherever we are able to extend our aid. We must remove the distinctions between native born and naturalized citizens to assure full protection of our laws to all. There is no place in the United States for ""second-class citizenship"". The protections provided by due process, right of appeal, and statutes of limitation, can be extended to non-citizens without hampering the security of our nation. We commend the Democratic Congress for the initial steps that have recently been taken toward liberalizing changes in immigration law. However, this should not be a piecemeal project and we are confident that a Democratic President in cooperation with Democratic Congresses will again implant a humanitarian and liberal spirit in our nation's immigration and citizenship policies. To the peoples and governments beyond our shores we offer the following pledges: THE UNDERDEVELOPED WORLD To the non-Communist nations of Asia, Africa, and Latin America: We shall create with you working partnerships based on mutual respect and understanding. In the Jeffersonian tradition, we recognize and welcome the irresistible momentum of the world revolution of rising expectations for a better life. We shall identify American policy with the values and objectives of this revolution. To this end the new Democratic Administration will revamp and refocus the objectives, emphasis and allocation of our foreign assistance programs. The proper purpose of these programs is not to buy gratitude or to recruit mercenaries, but to enable the peoples of these awakening, developing nations to make their own free choices. As they achieve a sense of belonging, of dignity, and of justice, freedom will become meaningful for them, and therefore worth defending. Where military assistance remains essential for the common defense, we shall see that the requirements are fully met. But as rapidly as security considerations permit, we will replace tanks with tractors, bombers with bulldozers, and tacticians with technicians. We shall place our programs of international cooperation on a long-term basis to permit more effective planning. We shall seek to associate other capital-exporting countries with us in promoting the orderly economic growth of the underdeveloped world. We recognize India and Pakistan as major tests of the capacity of free men in a difficult environment to master the age old problems of illiteracy, poverty, and disease. We will support their efforts in every practical way. We welcome the emerging new nations of Africa to the world community. Here again we shall strive to write a new chapter of fruitful cooperation. In Latin America we shall restore the Good Neighbor Policy based on far closer economic cooperation and increased respect and understanding. In the Middle East we will work for guarantees to insure independence for all states. We will encourage direct Arab Israeli peace negotiations, the resettlement of Arab refugees in lands where there is room and opportunity for them, an end to boycotts and blockades, and unrestricted use of the Suez Canal by all nations. A billion and a half people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are engaged in an unprecedented attempt to propel themselves into the 20th Century. They are striving to create or reaffirm their national identity. But they want much more than independence. They want an end to grinding poverty. They want more food, health for themselves and their children, and other benefits that a modern industrial civilization can provide. Communist strategy has sought to divert these aspirations into narrowly nationalistic channels, or external troublemaking, or authoritarianism. The Republican Administration has played into the hands of this strategy by concerning itself almost exclusively with the military problem of Communist invasion. The Democratic programs of economic cooperation will be aimed at making it as easy as possible for the political leadership in these countries to turn the energy, talent and resources of their peoples to orderly economic growth. History and current experience show that an annual per capita growth rate of at least 2 percent is feasible in these countries. The Democratic Administration's assistance program, in concert with the aid forthcoming from our partners in Western Europe, Japan, and the British Commonwealth, will be geared to facilitating this objective. The Democratic Administration will recognize that assistance to these countries is not an emergency or short-term matter. Through the Development Loan Fund and otherwise, we shall seek to assure continuity in our aid programs for periods of at least five years, in order to permit more effective allocation on our part and better planning by the governments of the countries receiving aid. More effective use of aid and a greater confidence in us and our motives will be the result. We shall establish priorities for foreign aid which will channel it to those countries abroad which, by their own willingness to help themselves, show themselves most capable of using it effectively. We shall use our own agricultural productivity as an effective tool of foreign aid, and also as a vital form of working capital for economic development. We shall seek new approaches which will provide assistance without disrupting normal world markets for food and fiber. We shall give attention to the problem of stabilizing world prices of agricultural commodities and basic raw materials on which many underdeveloped countries depend for needed foreign exchange. We shall explore the feasibility of shipping and storing a substantial part of our food abundance in a system of ""food banks"" located at distribution centers in the underdeveloped world. Such a system would be an effective means of alleviating famine and suffering in times of natural disaster, and of cushioning the effect of bad harvests. It would also have a helpful anti-inflationary influence as economic development gets under way. Although basic development requirements like transport, housing, schools, and river development may be financed by Government, these projects are usually built and sometimes managed by private enterprise. Moreover, outside this public sector a large and increasing role remains for private investment. The Republican Administration has done little to summon American business to play its part in this, one of the most creative tasks of our generation. The Democratic Administration will take steps to recruit and organize effectively the best business talent in America for foreign economic development. We urge continued economic assistance to Israel and the Arab peoples to help them raise their living standards. We pledge our best efforts for peace in the Middle East by seeking to prevent an arms race while guarding against the dangers of a military imbalance resulting from Soviet arms shipments. THE ATLANTIC COMMUNITY To our friends and associates in the Atlantic Community: We propose a broader partnership that goes beyond our common fears to recognize the depth and sweep of our common political, economic, and cultural interests. We welcome the recent heartening advances toward European unity. In every appropriate way, we shall encourage their further growth within the broader framework of the Atlantic Community. After World War II Democratic statesmen saw that an orderly, peaceful world was impossible with Europe shattered and exhausted. They fashioned the great programs which bear their names, the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan by which the economies of Europe were revived. Then in NATO they renewed for the common defense the ties of alliance forged in war. In these endeavors, the Democratic Administrations invited leading Republicans to full participation as equal partners. But the Republican Administration has rejected this principle of bi partisanship. We have already seen how the mutual trust and confidence created abroad under Democratic leadership have been eroded by arrogance, clumsiness, and lack of understanding in the Republican Administration. The new Democratic Administration will restore the former high levels of cooperation within the Atlantic Community envisaged from the beginning by the NATO treaty in political and economic spheres as well as military affairs. We welcome the progress towards European unity expressed in the Coal And Steel Community Euratom the European Economic Community the European Free Trade Association and the European Assembly. We shall conduct our relations with the nations of the Common Market so as to encourage the opportunities for freer and more expanded trade, and to avert the possibilities of discrimination that are inherent in it. We shall encourage adjustment with the so-called ""Outer Seven"" nations so as to enlarge further the area of freer trade. THE COMMUNIST WORLD To the rulers of the communist world: We confidently accept your challenge to competition in every field of human effort. We recognize this contest as one between two radically different approaches to the meaning of life, our open society which places its highest value upon individual dignity, and your closed society in which the rights of men are sacrificed to the state. We believe your Communist ideology to be sterile, unsound, and doomed to failure. We believe that your children will reject the intellectual prison in which you seek to confine them, and that ultimately they will choose the eternal principles of freedom. In the meantime, we are prepared to negotiate with you whenever and wherever there is a realistic possibility of progress without sacrifice of principle. If negotiations through diplomatic channels provide opportunities we will negotiate. If debate before the United Nations holds promise, we will debate. If meetings at high level offer prospects of success, we will be there. But we will use all the power, resources, and energy at our command to resist the further encroachment of Communism on freedom, whether at Berlin, Formosa, or new points of pressure as yet undisclosed. We will keep open the lines of communication with our opponents. Despite difficulties in the way of peaceful agreements, every useful avenue will be energetically explored and pursued. However, we will never surrender positions which are essential to the defense of freedom nor will we abandon peoples who are now behind the Iron Curtain through any formal approval of the status quo. Everyone proclaims ""firmness"" in support of Berlin. The issue is not the desire to be firm, but the capability to be firm. This the Democratic Party will provide as it has done before. The ultimate solution of the situation in berlin must be approached in the broader context of settlement of the tensions and divisions of Europe. The good faith of the United States is pledged likewise to defending Formosa. We will carry out that pledge. The new Democratic Administration will also reaffirm our historic policy of opposition to the establishment anywhere in the Americas of governments dominated by foreign powers, a policy now being undermined by Soviet threats to the freedom and independence of Cuba. The Government of the United States under a Democratic Administration will not be deterred from fulfilling its obligations and solemn responsibilities under its treaties and agreements with the nations of the Western Hemisphere. Nor will the United States in conformity with its treaty obligations permit the establishment of a regime dominated by international, atheistic Communism in the Western Hemisphere. To the people who live in the Communist world and its captive nations: We proclaim an enduring friendship which goes beyond governments and ideologies to our common human interest in a better world. Through exchanges of persons, cultural contacts, trade in non-strategic areas, and other non-governmental activities, we will endeavor to preserve and improve opportunities for human relationships which no Iron Curtain can permanently sever. No political platform promise in history was more cruelly cynical than the Republican effort to buy votes in 1952 with false promises of painless liberation for the captive nations. The blood of heroic freedom fighters in Hungary tragically proved this promise a fraud. We Democrats will never be party to such cruel cultivation of false hopes. We look forward to the day when the men and women of Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Rumania, and the other captive nations will stand again in freedom and justice. We will hasten, by every honorable and responsible means, the arrival of the day. We shall never accept any deal or arrangement which acquiesces in the present subjugation of these peoples. We deeply regret that the policies and actions of the Government of Communist China have interrupted the generations of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples. We reaffirm our pledge of determined opposition to the present admission of Communist China to the United Nations. Although normal diplomatic relations between our Governments are impossible under present conditions, we shall welcome any evidence that the Chinese Communist Government is genuinely prepared to create a new relationship based on respect for international obligations, including the release of american prisoners. We will continue to make every effort to effect the release of American citizens and servicemen now injustly imprisoned in Communist China and elsewhere in the Communist empire. THE UNITED NATIONS To all our fellow members of the United Nations: We shall strengthen our commitments in this, our great continuing institution for conciliation and the growth of a world community. Through the machinery of the United Nations we shall work for disarmament the establishment of an international police force, the strengthening of the World Court, and the establishment of world law. We shall propose the bolder and more effective use of the specialized agencies to promote the world's economic and social development. Great Democratic Presidents have taken the lead in the effort to unite the nations of the world in an international organization to assure world peace with justice under law. The League of Nations conceived by Woodrow Wilson was doomed by Repubican defeat of United States participation. The United Nations sponsored by Franklin Roosevelt, has become the one place where representatives of the rival systems and interests which divide the world can and do maintain continuous contact. The United States adherence to the World Court contains a so called ""self-judging reservation"" which, in effect, permits us to prevent a Court decision in any particular case in which we are involved. The Democratic Party proposes its repeal. To all these endeavors so essential to world peace, we, the members of the Democratic Party, will bring a new urgency, persistence, and determination, born of the conviction that in our thermonuclear century all of the other Rights of Man hinge on our ability to assure man's right to peace. The pursuit of peace, our contribution to the stability of the new nations of the world, our hopes for progress and well being at home, all these depend in large measure on our ability to release the full potential of our American economy for employment, production, and growth. Our generation of Americans has achieved a historic technological breakthrough. Today we are capable of creating an abundance in goods and services beyond the dreams of our parents. Yet on the threshold of plenty the Republican Administration hesitates, confused and afraid. As a result, massive human needs now exist side by side with idle workers, idle capital, and idle machines. The Republican failure in the economic field has been virtually complete. Their years of power have consisted of two recessions, in 1953-1954 and 1957-1960, separated by the most severe peacetime inflation in history. They have shown themselves incapable of checking inflation. In their efforts to do so, they have brought on recessions that have thrown millions of Americans out of work. Yet even in these slumps, the cost of living has continued to climb, and it is now at an all-time high. They have slowed down the rate of growth of the economy to about one-third the rate of the Soviet Union. Over the past 7 and one-half year period, the Republicans have failed to balance the budget or reduce the national debt. Responsible fiscal policy requires surpluses in good times to more than offset the deficits which may occur in recessions, in order to reduce the national debt over the long run. The Republican Administration has produced the deficits, in fact, the greatest deficit in any peacetime year in history, in 1958-1959, but only occasional and meager surpluses. Their first seven years produced a total deficit of nearly 19 billion dollars. While reducing outlays for essential public services which directly benefit our people, they have raised the annual interest charge on the national debt to a level 3 billion dollars higher than when they took office. In the eight fiscal years of the Republican Administration, these useless higher interest payments will have cost the taxpayer 9 billion dollars. They have mismanaged the public debt not only by increasing interest rates, but also by failing to lengthen the average maturity of Government obligations when they had a clear opportunity to do so. ECONOMIC GROWTH The new Democratic Administration will confidently proceed to unshackle American enterprise and to free American labor, industrial leadership, and capital, to create an abundance that will outstrip any other system. Free competitive enterprise is the most creative and productive form of economic order that the world has seen. The recent slow pace of American growth is due not to the failure of our free economy but to the failure of our national leadership. We Democrats believe that our economy can and must grow at an average rate of 5 percent annually, almost twice as fast as our average annual rate since 1953. We pledge ourselves to policies that will achieve this goal without inflation. Economic growth is the means whereby we improve the American standard of living and produce added tax resources for national security and essential public services. Our economy must grow more swiftly in order to absorb two groups of workers, the much larger number of young people who will be reaching working age in the 1960s, and the workers displaced by the rapid pace of technological advances, including automation. Republican policies which have stifled growth could only mean increasingly severe unemployment, particularly of youth and older workers. AN END TO TIGHT MONEY As the first step in speeding economic growth, a Democratic President will put an end to the present high interest, tight money policy. This policy has failed in its stated purpose to keep prices down. It has given us two recessions within five years, bankrupted many of our farmers, produced a record number of business failures, and added billions of dollars in unnecessary higher interest charges to Government budgets and the cost of living. A new Democratic Administration will reject this philosophy of economic slowdown. We are committed to maximum employment, at decent wages and with fair profits, in a far more productive, expanding economy. The Repblican high-interest policy has extracted a costly toll from every American who has financed a home, an automobile, a refrigerator, or a television set. It has foisted added burdens on taxpayers of state and local governments which must borrow for schools and other public services. It has added to the cost of many goods and services, and hence has been itself a factor in inflation. It has created windfalls for many financial institutions. The nine billion dollars of added interest charges on the national debt would have been even higher but for the prudent insistence of the Democratic Congress that the ceiling on interest rates for long-term Government bonds be maintained. CONTROL OF INFLATION The American consumer has a right to fair prices. We are determined to secure that right. Inflation has its roots in a variety of causes, its cure lies in a variety of remedies. Among those remedies are monetary and credit policies properly applied, budget surpluses in times of full employment, and action to restrain ""administered price"" increases in industries where economic power rests in the hands of a few. A fair share of the gains from increasing productivity in many industries should be passed on to the consumer through price reductions. The agenda which a new Democratic Administration will face next January is crowded with urgent needs on which action has been delayed, deferred, or denied by the present Administration. A new Democratic Administration will undertake to meet those needs. It will reaffirm the Economic Bill of Rights which Franklin Roosevelt wrote into our national conscience sixteen years ago. It will reaffirm these rights for all Americans of whatever race, place of residence, or station in life, 1. ""The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the nation."" FULL EMPLOYMENT The Democratic Party reaffirms its support of full employment as a paramount objective of national policy. For nearly 30 months the rate of unemployment has been between 5 and 7 and one-half percent of the labor force. A pool of three to four million citizens, able and willing to work but unable to find jobs, has been written off by the Republican Administration as a ""normal"" readjustment of the economic system. The policies of a Democratic Administration to restore economic growth will reduce current unemployment to a minimum. Thereafter, if recessionary trends appear, we will act promptly with counter measures, such as public works or temporary tax cuts. We will not stand idly by and permit recessions to run their course as the Republican Administration has done. AID TO DEPRESSED AREAS The right to a job requires action to create new industry in America's depressed areas of chronic unemployment. General economic measures will not alone solve the problem of localities which suffer some special disadvantage. To bring prosperity to these depressed areas and to enable them to make their full contribution to the national welfare, specially directed action is needed. Areas of heavy and persistent unemployment result from depletion of natural resources, technological change, shifting defense requirements, or trade imbalances which have caused the decline of major industries. Whole communities, urban and rural, have been left stranded in distress and despair, through no fault of their own. These communities have undertaken valiant efforts of self help. But mutual aid, as well as self-help, is part of the American tradition. Stricken communities deserve the help of the whole nation. The Democratic Congress twice passed bills to provide this help. The Republican President twice vetoed them. These bills proposed low-interest loans to private enterprise to create new industry and new jobs in depressed communities, assistance to the communities to provide public facilities necessary to encourage the new industry, and retraining of workers for the new jobs. The Democratic Congress will again pass, and the Democratic President will sign, such a bill. DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT The right to a job requires action to break down artificial and arbitrary barriers to employment based on age race sex religion or national origin. Unemployment strikes hardest at workers over 40, minority groups, young people, and women. We will not achieve full employment until prejudice against these workers is wiped out. COLLECTIVE BARGAINING The right to a job requires the restoration of full support for collective-bargaining and the repeal of the anti-labor excesses which have been written into our labor laws. Under Democratic leadership a sound national policy was developed, expressed particularly by the Wagner National Labor Relations Act, which guaranteed the rights of workers to organize and to bargain collectively. But the Republican Administration has replaced this sound policy with a national anti-labor policy.  The Republican Taft-Hartley Act seriously weakened unions in their efforts to bring economic justice to the millions of American workers who remain unorganized. By administrative action anti-labor personnel appointed by the Republicans to the National Labor Relations Board have made the Taft-Hartley Act even more restrictive in its application than in its language. Thus the traditional goal of the Democratic Party, to give all workers the right to organize and bargain collectively, has still not been achieved. We pledge the enactment of an affirmative labor policy which will encourage free collective-bargaining through the growth and development of free and responsible unions. Millions of workers just now seeking to organize are blocked by Federally authorized ""right-to-work"" laws, unreasonable limitations on the right to picket, and other hampering legislative and administrative provisions. Again, in the new Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, the Republican Administration perverted the constructive effort of the Democratic Congress to deal with improper activities of a few in labor and management by turning that Act into a means of restricting the legitimate rights of the vast majority of working men and women in honest labor unions. This law likewise strikes hardest at the weak or poorly organized, and it fails to deal with abuses of management as vigorously as with those of labor. We will repeal the authorization for ""right-to-work"" laws, limitations on the rights to strike, to picket peacefully and to tell the public the facts of a labor dispute, and other anti-labor features of the Taft-Hartley Act and the 1959 Act. This unequivocal pledge for the repeal of the anti-labor and restrictive provisions of those laws will encourage collective bargaining and strengthen and support the free and honest labor movement. The Railroad Retirement Act and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act are in need of improvement. We strongly oppose Republican attempts to weaken the Railway Labor Act. We shall strengthen and modernize the Walsh-Healey and Davis Bacon Acts, which protect the wage standards of workers employed by Government contractors. Basic to the achievement of stable labor-management relations is leadership from the White House. The Republican Administration has failed to provide such leadership. It failed to foresee the deterioration of labor-management relations in the steel industry last year. When a national emergency was obviously developing, it failed to forestall it. When the emergency came, the Administration's only solution was government by injunction. A Democratic President, through his leadership and concern, will produce a better climate for continuing constructive relationships between labor and management. He will have periodic White House conferences between labor and management to consider their mutual problems before then reach the critical stage. A Democratic President will use the vast fact-finding facilities that are available to inform himself, and the public, in exercising his leadership in labor disputes for the benefit of the nation as a whole. If he needs more such facilities, or authority, we will provide them. We further pledge that in the administration of all labor legislation we will restore the level of integrity, competence and sympathetic understanding required to carry out the intent of such legislation. PLANNING FOR AUTOMATION The right to a job requires planning for automation, so that men and women will be trained and available to meet shifting employment needs. We will conduct a continuing analysis of the nation's manpower resources and of measures which may be required to assure their fullest development and use. We will provide the Government leadership necessary to insure that the blessings of automation do not become burdens of widespread unemployment. For the young and the technologically displaced workers, we will provide the opportunity for training and retraining that equips them for jobs to be filled. MINIMUM WAGES 2. ""The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation."" At the bottom of the income scale are some eight million families whose earnings are too low to provide even basic necessities of food, shelter, and clothing. We pledge to raise the minimum wage to one dollar and twenty five cents per hour and to extend coverage to several million workers not now protected. We pledge further improvements in the wage, hour and coverage standards of the Fair Labor Standards Act so as to extend its benefits to all workers employed in industries engaged in or affecting interstate commerce and to raise its standards to keep up with our general economic progress and needs. We shall seek to bring the two million men, women and children who work for wages on the farms of the United States under the protection of existing labor and social legislation, and to assure migrant labor, perhaps the most underprivileged of all, of a comprehensive program to bring them not only decent wages but also adequate standards of health housing Social Security protection education and welfare services. AGRICULTURE 3. ""The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living."" We shall take positive action to raise farm income to full parity levels and to preserve family farming as a way of life. We shall put behind us once and for all the timidity with which our Government has viewed our abundance of food and fiber. We will set new high levels of food and consumption both at home and abroad. As long as many Americans and hundreds of millions of people in other countries remain underfed, we shall regard these agricultural riches, and the family farmers who produce them, not as a liability but as a national asset. Using Our Abundance The Democratic Administration will inaugurate a national food and fiber policy for expanded use of our agricultural abundance. We will no longer view food stockpiles with alarm but will use them as powerful instruments for peace and plenty. We will increase consumption at home. A vigorous, expanding economy will enable many American families to eat more and better food. We will use the food stamp programs authorized to feed needy children, the aged and the unemployed. We will expand and improve the school lunch and milk programs. We will establish and maintain food reserves for national defense purposes near important population centers in order to preserve lives in event of national disaster, and will operate them so as not to depress farm prices. We will expand research into new industrial uses of agricultural products. We will increase consumption abroad. The Democratic Party believes our nation's capacity to produce food and fiber is one of the great weapons for waging war against hunger and want throughout the world. With wise management of our food abundance we will expand trade between nations, support economic and human development programs, and combat famine. Unimaginative, outmoded Republican policies which fail to use these productive capacities of our farms have been immensely costly to our nation. They can and will be changed. Achieving Income Parity While farmers have raised their productive efficiency to record levels, Republican farm policies have forced their income to drop by 30 percent. Tens of thousands of farm families have been bankrupted and forced off the land. This has happened despite the fact that the Secretary of Agriculture has spent more on farm programs than all previous Secretaries in history combined. Farmers acting individually or in small groups are helpless to protect their incomes from sharp declines. Their only recourse is to produce more, throwing production still further out of balance with demand and driving prices down further. This disastrous downward cycle can be stopped only by effective farm programs sympathetically administered with the assistance of demo elected farmer committees. The Democratic Administration will work to bring about full parity income for farmers in all segments of agriculture by helping them to balance farm production with the expanding needs of the nation and the world. Measures to this end include production and marketing quotas measured in terms of barrels, bushels and bales, loans on basic commodities at not less than 90 percent of parity, production payments, commodity purchases, and marketing orders and agreements. We repudiate the Republican Administration of the Soil Bank Program, which has emphasized the retirement of whole farm units, and we pledge an orderly land retirement and conservation program. We are convinced that a successful combination of these approaches will cost considerably less than present Republican programs which have failed. We will encourage agricultural cooperatives by expanding and liberalizing existing credit facilities and developing new facilities if necessary to assist them in extending their marketing and purchasing activities, and we will protect cooperatives from punitive taxation. The Democratic Administration will improve the marketing practices of the family-type dairy farm to reduce risk of loss. To protect farmers' incomes in times of natural disaster, the Federal Crop Insurance Program, created and developed experimentally under Democratic Administrations, should be invigorated and expanded nationwide. Improving Working and Living on Farms Garm families have been among those victimized most severely by Republican tight-money policies. Young people have been barred from entering agriculture. Giant corporations and other non-farmers, with readier access to credit and through vertical integration methods, have supplanted hundreds of farm families and caused the bankruptcy of many others. The Democratic Party is committed by tradition and conviction to preservation of family agriculture. To this end, we will expand and liberalize farm credit facilities, especially to meet the needs of family farm agriculture and to assist beginning farmers. Many families in America's rural counties are still living in poverty because of inadequate resources and opportunity. This blight and personal desperation should have received national priority attention long ago. The new Democratic Administration will begin at once to eradicate long neglected rural blight. We will help people help themselves with extended and supervised credit for farm improvement, local industrial development, improved vocational training and other assistance to those wishing to change to non farm employment, and with the fullest development of commercial and recreational possibilities. This is one of the major objectives of the area redevelopment program, twice vetoed by the Republican President. The rural electric cooperatives celebrate this year the twenty-fifth anniversary of the creation of the Rural Electrification Administration under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Democratic Congress has successfully fought the efforts of the Republican Administration to cut off REA loans and force high interest rate policies on this great rural enterprise. We will maintain interest rates for REA co-ops and public power districts at the levels provided in present law. We deplore the Administration's failure to provide the dynamic leadership necessary for encouraging loans to rural users for generation of power where necessary. We promise the co-ops active support in meeting the ever growing demand for electric power and telephone service, to be filled on a complete area coverage basis without requiring benefits for special interest power groups. In every way we will seek to help the men, women, and children whose livelihood comes from the soil to achieve better housing, education, health, and decent earnings and working conditions. All these goals demand the leadership of a Secretary of Agriculture who is conversant with the technological and economic aspects of farm problems, and who is sympathetic with the objectives of effective farm legislation not only for farmers but for the best interest of the nation as a whole. SMALL BUSINESS 4. ""The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home and abroad."" The new Democratic Administration will act to make our free economy really free, free from the oppression of monopolistic power, and free from the suffocating impact of high interest rates. We will help create an economy in which small businesses can take root, grow and flourish. We Democrats pledge: 1. Action to aid small business in obtaining credit and equity capital at reasonable rates. Small business which must borrow to stay alive has been a particular victim of the high interest policies of the Republican administration. The loan program of the small Business Administration should be accelerated, and the independence of that agency preserved. the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 must be administered with a greater sense of its importance and possibilities. 2. Protection of the public against the growth of monopoly. The last seven and one-half years of Republican government has been the greatest period of merger and amalgamation in industry and banking in American history. Democratic Congresses have enacted numerous important measures to strengthen our anti trust laws. Since 1950 the four Democratic Congresses have enacted laws like the Celler-Kefauver Anti-Merger Act, and improved the laws against price discriminations and tie in sales. When the Republicans were in control of the 80th and 83rd Congresses they failed to enact a single measure to strengthen or improve the anti-trust laws. The democratic party opposes this trend to monopoly. We pledge vigorous enforcement of the anti-trust laws. We favor requiring corporations to file advance notice of mergers with the anti-trust enforcement agencies. We favor permitting all firms to have access at reasonable rates to patented inventions resulting from Government financed research and development contracts. We favor strengthening the Robinson-Patman Act to protect small business against price discrimination. We favor authorizing the Federal Trade Commission to obtain temporary injunctions during the pendency of administrative proceedings. 3. A more equitable share of Government contracts to small and independent business. We will move from almost complete reliance on negotiation in the award of government contracts toward open, competitive bidding. HOUSING 5. ""The right of every family to a decent home."" Today our rate of home building is less than that of ten years ago. A healthy, expanding economy will enable us to build two million homes a year, in wholesome neighborhoods, for people of all incomes. At this rate, within a single decade we can clear away our slums and assure every American family a decent place to live. Republican policies have led to a decline of the home building industry and the production of fewer homes. Republican high-interest policies have forced the cost of decent housing beyond the range of many families. Republican indifference has perpetuated slums. We record the unpleasant fact that in 1960 at least 40 million Americans live in substandard housing. One million new families are formed each year and need housing, and 300,000 existing homes are lost through demolition or other causes and need to be replaced. At present, construction does not even meet these requirements, much less permit reduction of the backlog of slum units. We support a housing construction goal of more than two million homes a year. Most of the increased construction will be priced to meet the housing needs of middle-income and low-income families who now live in substandard housing and are priced out of the market for decent homes. Our housing programs will provide for rental as well as sales housing. They will permit expanded cooperative housing programs and sharply stepped up rehabilitation of existing homes. To make possible the building of two million homes a year in wholesome neighborhoods, the home building industry should be aided by special mortgage assistance, with low interest rates, long-term mortgage periods and reduced down payments. Where necessary, direct Government loans should be provided. Even with this new and flexible approach, there will still be need for a substantial low-rent public housing program authorizing as many units as local communities require and are prepared to build. HEALTH 6. ""The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health."" Illness is expensive. Many Americans have neither incomes nor insurance protection to enable them to pay for modern health care. The problem is particularly acute with our older citizens, among whom serious illness strikes most often. We shall provide medical care benefits for the aged as part of the time-tested Social Security insurance system. We reject any proposal which would require such citizens to submit to the indignity of a means test, a ""pauper's oath"". For young and old alike, we need more medical schools, more hospitals, more research laboratories to speed the final conquest of major killers. Medical Care for Older Persons Fifty million Americans, more than a fourth of our people, have no insurance protection against the high cost of illness. For the rest, private health insurance pays, on the average, only about one-third of the cost of medical care. The problem is particularly acute among the 16 million Americans over 65 years old, and among disabled workers, widows and orphans. Most of these have low-incomes and the elderly among them suffer two to three times as much illness as the rest of the population. The Republican Administration refused to acknowledge any national responsibility for health care for elder citizens until forced to do so by an increasingly outraged demand. Then, its belated proposal was a cynical sham built around a degrading test based on means or income, a ""pauper's oath"". The most practicable way to provide health protection for older people is to use the contributory machinery of the Social Security system for insurance covering hospital bills and other high-cost medical services. For those relatively few of our older people who have never been eligible for Social Security coverage we shall provide corresponding benefits by appropriations from the general revenue.  Research We will step up medical research on the major killers and crippling diseases, cancer, heart disease, arthritis, mental illness. Expenditures for these purposes should be limited only by the availability of personnel and promising lines of research. Today such illness costs us 35 billion dollars annually, much of which could be avoided. Federal appropriations for medical research are barely one percent of this amount. Heart disease and cancer together account for two out of every three deaths in this country. The Democratic President will summon to a White House conference the nation's most distinguished scientists in these fields to map a coordinated long run program for the prevention and control of these diseases. We will also support a cooperative program with other nations on international health research. Hospitals We will expand and improve the Hill-Burton hospital construction program. Health Manpower To ease the growing shortage of doctors and other medical personnel we propose Federal aid for constructing, expanding and modernizing schools of medicine, dentistry, nursing and public health. We are deeply concerned that the high cost of medical education is putting this profession beyond the means of most American families. We will provide scholarships and other assistance to break through the financial barriers to medical education. Mental Health Mental patients fill more than half the hospital beds in the country today. We will provide greatly increased Federal support for psychiatric research and training, and community mental health programs, to help bring back thousands of our hospitalized mentally ill to full and useful lives in the community. 7. ""The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accidents, and unemployment."" A PROGRAM FOR THE AGING The Democratic Administration will end the neglect of our older citizens. They deserve lives of usefulness, dignity, independence, and participation. We shall assure them not only health care but employment for those who want work, decent housing, and recreation. Already 16 million Americans, about one in ten, are over 65, with the prospect of 26 million by 1980. Health As stated, we will provide an effective system for paid up medical insurance upon retirement financed during working years through the Social Security mechanism and available to all retired persons without a means test. This has first priority. Income Half of the people over 65 have incomes inadequate for basic nutrition, decent housing, minimum recreation and medical care. Older people who do not want to retire need employment opportunity and those of retirement age who no longer wish to or cannot work need better retirement benefits. We pledge a campaign to eliminate discrimination in employment due to age. As a first step we will prohibit such discrimination by Government contractors and subcontractors. We will amend the Social Security Act to increase the retirement benefit for each additional year of work after 65, thus encouraging workers to continue on the job full time. To encourage part time work by others, we favor raising the 1200 dollar-a-year ceiling on what a worker may earn while still drawing Social Security benefits. Retirement benefits must be increased generally, and minimum benefits raised from 33 dollars a month to 50 dollars. Housing We shall provide decent and suitable housing which older persons can afford. Specifically we shall move ahead with the program of direct Government loans for housing for older people initiated in the Housing Act of 1959, a program which the Republican Administration has sought to kill. Special Services We shall take Federal action in support of state efforts to bring standards of care in nursing homes and other institutions for the aged up to desirable minimums. We shall support demonstration and training programs to translate proven research into action in such fields as health, nutritional guidance, home care, counseling, recreational activity. Taken together, these measures will affirm a new charter of rights for the older citizens among us, the right to a life of usefulness, health, dignity, independence and participation. WELFARE Disability Insurance We shall permit workers who are totally and permanently disabled to retire at any age, removing the arbitrary requirement that the worker be 50 years of age. We shall also amend the law so that after six months of total disability, a worker will be eligible for disability benefits, with restorative services to enable him to return to work. Physically Handicapped We pledge continued support of legislation for the rehabilitation of physically handicapped persons and improvement of employment opportunity for them. Public Assistance Persons in need who are inadequately protected by social insurance are cared for by the states and local communities under public assistance programs. The Federal Government, which now shares the cost of aid to some of these, should share in all, and benefits should be made available without regard to residence. Unemployment Benefits We will establish uniform minimum standards throughout the nation for coverage, duration, and amount of unemployment insurance benefits. Equality for Women We support legislation which will guarantee to women equality of rights under the law, including equal pay for equal work. Child Welfare The Child Welfare Program and other services already established under the Social Security Act should be expanded. Federal leadership is required in the nationwide campaign to prevent and control juvenile delinquency. Intergroup Relations We propose a Federal bureau of intergroup relations to help solve problems of discrimination in housing, education, employment, and community opportunities in general. The bureau would assist in the solution of problems arising from the resettlement of immigrants and migrants within our own country, and in resolving religious, social and other tensions where they arise. EDUCATION 8. ""The right to a good education."" America's young people are our greatest resource for the future. Each of them deserves the education which will best develop his potentialities. We shall act at once to help in building the classrooms and employing the teachers that are essential if the right to a good education is to have genuine meaning for all the youth of America in the decade ahead. As a national investment in our future we propose a program of loans and scholarship grants to assure that qualified young Americans will have full opportunity for higher education, at the institutions of their choice, regardless of the income of their parents. The new Democratic Administration will end eight years of official neglect of our educational system. America's education faces a financial crisis. The tremendous increase in the number of children of school and college age has far outrun the available supply of educational facilities and qualified teachers. The classroom shortage alone is interfering with the education of ten million students. America's teachers, parents and school administrators have striven courageously to keep up with the increased challenge of education. So have states and local communities. Education absorbs two fifths of all their revenue. with limited resources, private educational institutions have shouldered their share of the burden. Only the Federal Government is not doing its part. For eight years, measures for the relief of the educational crisis have been held up by the cynical maneuvers of the Republican Party in Congress and the White House. We believe that America can meet its educational obligations only with generous Federal financial support, within the traditional framework of local control. The assistance will take the form of Federal grants to states for educational purposes they deem most pressing including classroom construction and teachers salaries. It will include aid for the construction of academic facilities as well as dormitories at colleges and universities. We pledge further Federal support for all phases of vocational education for youth and adults, for libraries and adult education for realizing the potential of educational television, and for exchange of students and teachers with other nations. As part of a broader concern for young people we recommend establishment of a Youth Conservation Corps, to give underprivileged young people a rewarding experience in a healthful environment. The pledges contained in this Economic Bill of Rights point the way to a better life for every family in America. They are the means to a goal that is now within our reach, the final eradication in America of the age-old evil of poverty. Yet there are other pressing needs on our national agenda. NATURAL RESOURCES A thin layer of earth, a few inches of rain, and a blanket of air make human life possible on our planet. Sound public policy must assure that these essential resources will be available to provide the good life for our children and future generations. Water, timber and grazing lands, recreational areas in our parks, shores, forests and wildernesses, energy, minerals, even pure air, all are feeling the press of enormously increased demands of a rapidly growing population. Natural resources are the birthright of all the people. The new Democratic Administration, with the vision that built a TVA and a Grand Coulee, will develop and conserve that heritage for the use of this and future generations. We will reverse Republican policies under which America's resources have been wasted depleted underdeveloped and recklessly given away. We favor the best use of our natural resources, which generally means adoption of the multiple purpose principle to achieve full development for all the many functions they can serve. Water and Soil An abundant supply of pure water is essential to our economy. this is a national problem. Water must serve domestic, industrial and irrigation needs and inland navigation. It must provide habitat for fish and wildlife, supply the base for much outdoor recreation, and generate electricity. Water must also be controlled to prevent floods, pollution, salinity and silt. The new Democratic Administration will develop a comprehensive national water resource policy. In cooperation with state and local governments, and interested private groups, the Democratic Administration will will develop a balanced, multiple purpose plan for each major river basin, to be revised periodically to meet changing needs. We will erase the Republican slogan of ""no new starts"" and will begin again to build multiple purpose dams, hydroelectric facilities, flood-control works, navigation facilities, and reclamation projects to meet mounting and urgent needs. We will renew the drive to protect every acre of farm land under a soil and water conservation plan, and we will speed up the small watershed program. We will support and intensify the research effort to find an economical way to convert salt and brackish water. The Republicans discouraged this research, which holds untold possibilities for the whole world. Water and Air Pollution America can no longer take pure water and air for granted. Polluted rivers carry their dangers to everyone living along their courses, impure air does not respect boundaries. Federal action is needed in planning, coordinating and helping to finance pollution control. The states and local communities cannot go it alone. Yet President Eisenhower vetoed a Democratic bill to give them more financial help in building sewage treatment plants. A Democratic President will sign such a bill. Democrats will step up research on pollution control giving special attention to: 1. the rapidly growing problem of air pollution from industrial plants, automobile exhausts, and other sources, and 2. disposal of chemical and radioactive wastes, some of which are now being dumped off our coasts without adequate knowledge of the potential consequences. Outdoor Recreation As population grows and the work week shortens and transportation becomes easier and speedier, the need for outdoor recreation facilities mounts. We must act quickly to retain public access to the oceans gulfs rivers streams lakes and reservoirs areas while there is yet time. Areas near major population centers are and their shorelines, and to reserve adequate camping and recreational particularly needed. The new Democratic Administration will work to improve and extend recreation opportunities in national parks and monuments, forests, and river development projects, and near metropolitan areas. Emphasis will be on attractive low-cost facilities for all the people and on preventing undue commercialization. The National Park System is still incomplete, in particular, the few remaining suitable shorelines must be included in it. A national wilderness system should be created for areas already set aside as wildernesses. The system should be extended but only after careful consideration by the Congress of the value of areas for competing uses. Recreational needs of the surrounding area should be given important consideration in disposing of Federally owned lands. We will protect fish and game habitats from commercial exploitation and require military installations to conform to sound conservation practices. Energy The Republican Administration would turn the clock back to the days before the New Deal, in an effort to divert the benefits of the great natural energy resources from all the people to a favored few. It has followed for many years a ""no new starts"" policy. It has stalled atomic energy development, it has sought to cripple rural electrification. It has closed the pilot plant on getting oil from shale. It has harrassed and hampered the TVA. We reject this philosophy and these policies. The people are entitled to use profitably what they already own. The Democratic Administration instead will foster the development of efficient regional giant power systems from all sources, including water, tidal, and nuclear power, to supply low cost electricity to all retail electric systems, public, private, and cooperative. The Democratic Administration will continue to develop ""yardsticks"" for measuring the rates of private utility systems. This means meeting the needs of rural electric cooperatives for low interest loans for distribution, transmission and generation facilities, Federal transmission facilities, where appropriate, to provide efficient low-cost power supply, and strict enforcement of the public preference clauses in power marketing. The Democratic Administration will support continued study and research on energy fuel resources, including new sources in wind and sun. It will push forward with the Passamaquoddy tidal power project with its great promise of cheaper power and expanded prosperity for the people of New England. We support the establishment of a national fuels policy. The 15 billion dollar national investment in atomic energy should be protected as a part of the public domain. Federal Lands and Forests The record of the Republican Administration in handling the public domain is one of complete lethargy. It has failed to secure existing assets. In some cases, it has given away priceless resources for plunder by private corporations, as in the Al Sarena mining incident and the secret leasing of game refuges to favored oil interests. The new Democratic Administration will develop balanced land and forest policies suited to the needs of a growing America. This means intensive forest management in a multiple-use and sustained-yield basis, reforestation of burnt-over lands, building public access roads, range reseeding and improvement, intensive work in watershed management, concern for small business operations, and insuring free public access to public lands for recreational uses. Minerals America uses half the minerals produced in the entire Free World. Yet our mining industry is in what may be the initial phase of a serious long-term depression. Sound policy requires that we strengthen the domestic mining industry without interfering with adequate supplies of needed materials at reasonable costs. We pledge immediate efforts toward the establishment of a realistic long-range minerals policy. The new Democratic Administration will begin intensive research on scientific prospecting for mineral deposits. We will speed up the geologic mapping of the country, with emphasis on Alaska. We will resume research and development work on use of low grade mineral reserves, especially oil shale, lignites, iron ore taconite, and radio-active minerals. These efforts have been halted or cut back by the Republican Administration. The Democratic Party favors a study of the problem of non uniform seaward boundaries of the costal states. Government Machinery for Managing Resources Long-range programming of the nation's resource development is essential. We favor creation of a council of advisors on resources and conservation, which will evaluate and report annually upon our resource needs and progress. We shall put budgeting for resources on a businesslike basis, distinguishing between operating expense and capital investment, so that the country can have an accurate picture of the costs and returns. We propose the incremental method in determining the economic justification of our river basin programs. Charges for commercial use of public lands will be brought into line with benefits received. CITIES AND THEIR SUBURBS A new Democratic Administration will expand Federal programs to help urban communities clear their slums, dispose of their sewage, educate their children, transport suburban commuters to and from their jobs, and combat juvenile delinquency. We will give the city dweller a voice at the Cabinet table by bringing together within a single department programs concerned with urban and metropolitan problems. The United States is now predominantly an urban nation. The efficiency, comfort, and beauty of our cities and suburbs influence the lives of all Americans. Local governments have found increasing difficulty in coping with such fundamental public problems as urban renewal, slum clearance, water supply, mass transportation recreation, health, welfare, education and metropolitan planning. These problems are, in many cases, interstate and regional in scope. Yet the Republican Administration has turned its back on urban and suburban America. The list of Republican vetoes includes housing, urban renewal and slum clearance, area redevelopment, public works, airports and steam pollution control. It has proposed severe cutbacks in aid for hospital construction, public assistance, vocational education, community facilities and sewage disposal. The result has been to force communities to thrust an ever greater tax load upon the already overburdened property taxpayer and to forgo needed public services. The Democratic Party believes that state and local governments are strengthened, not weakened by financial assistance from the Federal Government. We will extend such aid without impairing local administration through unnecessary Federal interference or red tape. We propose a ten year action program to restore our cities and provide for balanced suburban development, including the following: 1. The elimination of slums and blight and the restoration of cities and depressed areas within the next ten years. 2. Federal aid for metropolitan area planning and community facility programs. 3. Federal aid for comprehensive metropolitan transportation programs, including bus and rail mass transit, commuter railroads as well as highway programs, and construction of civil airports. 4. Federal aid in combating air and water pollution. 5. Expansion of park systems to meet the recreation needs of our growing population. The Federal Government must recognize the financial burdens placed on local governments, urban and rural alike, by Federal installations and land holdings. TRANSPORTATION Over the past seven years, we have watched the steady weakening of the nation's transportation system. Railroads are in distress. Highways are congested. Airports and airways lag far behind the needs of the jet age. To meet this challenge we will establish a national transportation policy, designed to coordinate and modernize our facilities for transportation by road, rail, water, and air. Air The jet age has made rapid improvement in air safety imperative. Rather than ""an orderly withdrawal"" from the airport grant programs as proposed by the Republican Administration, we pledge to expand the program to accommodate growing air traffic. Water Development of our inland waterways, our harbors, and Great Lakes commerce has been held back by the Republican President. We pledge the improvement of our rivers and harbors by new starts and adequate maintenance. A strong and efficient American-flag merchant marine is essential to peacetime commerce and defense emergencies. Continued aid for ship construction and operation to offset cost differentials favoring foreign shipping is essential to these goals. Roads The Republican Administration has slowed down, stretched out and greatly increased the costs of the interstate highway program. The Democratic Party supports the highway program embodied in the Acts of 1956 and 1958 and the principle of Federal-state partnership in highway construction. We commend the Democratic Congress for establishing a special committee which has launched an extensive investigation of this highway program. Continued scrutiny of this multi-billion-dollar highway program can prevent waste, inefficiency and graft and maintain the public's confidence. Rail The nation's railroads are in particular need of freedom from burdensome regulation to enable them to compete effectively with other forms of transportation. We also support Federal assistance in meeting certain capital needs, particularly for urban mass transportation. SCIENCE We will recognize the special role of our Federal Government in support of basic and applied research. Space The Republican Administration has remained incredibly blind to the prospects of space exploration. It has failed to pursue space programs with a sense of urgency at all close to their importance to the future of the world. It has allowed the Communists to hit the moon first, and to launch substantially greater payloads. The Republican program is a catchall of assorted projects with no clearly defined, long range plan of research. The new Democratic Administration will press forward with our national space program in full realization of the importance of space accomplishments to our national security and our international prestige. We shall reorganize the program to achieve both efficiency and speedy execution. We shall bring top scientists into positions of responsibility. We shall undertake long-term basic research in space science and propulsion. We shall initiate negotiations leading toward the international regulation of space. Atomic Energy The United States became pre-eminent in the development of atomic energy under Democratic Administrations. The Republican Administration, despite its glowing promises of ""Atoms for Peace"" has permitted the gradual deterioration of United States leadership in atomic development both at home and abroad. In order to restore United States leadership in atomic development, the new Democratic Administration will: 1. Restore truly nonpartisan and vigorous administration of the vital atomic energy program. 2. Continue the development of the various promising experimental and prototype atomic power plants which show promise, and provide increasing support for longer-range projects at the frontiers of atomic energy application. 3. Continue to preserve and support national laboratories and other Federal atomic installations as the foundation of technical progress and a bulwark of national defense. 4. Accelerate the Rover nuclear rocket project and auxiliary power facilities so as to achieve world leadership in peaceful outer space exploration. 5. Give reality to the United States international atoms-for peace programs and continue and expand technological assistance to underdeveloped countries. 6. Consider measures for improved organization and procedure for radiation protection and reactor safety, including a strengthening of the role of the Federal Radiation Council, and the separation of quasi-judicial functions in reactor safety regulations. 7. Provide a balanced and flexible nuclear defense capability, including the augmentation of the nuclear submarine fleet. Oceanography Oceanographic research is needed to advance such important programs as food and minerals from our Great Lakes and the sea. the present Administration has neglected this new scientific frontier. GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS We shall reform the processes of Government in all branches, Executive, Legislative, and Judicial. We will clean out corruption and conflicts of interest, and improve Government services. The Federal Service Two weeks before this Platform was adopted, the difference between the Democratic and Republican attitudes toward Government employees was dramatically illustrated. The Democratic Congress passed a fully justified pay increase to bring Government pay scales more nearly into line with those of private industry. The Republican President vetoed the pay raise. The Democratic Congress decisively overrode the veto. The heavy responsibilities of modern government require a Federal service characterized by devotion to duty, honesty of purpose and highest competence. We pledge the modernization and strengthening of our Civil Service system. We shall extend and improve the employees appeals system and improve programs for recognizing the outstanding merits of individual employees. Ethics in Government We reject totally the concept of dual or triple loyalty on the part of Federal officials in high places. The conflict-of-interest statutes should be revised and strengthened to assure the Federal service of maximum security against unethical practices on the part of public officials. The Democratic Administration will establish and enforce a Code of Ethics to maintain the full dignity and integrity of the Federal service and to make it more attractive to the ablest men and women. Regulatory Agencies The Democratic Party promises to clean up the federal regulatory agencies. The acceptance by Republican appointees to these agencies of gifts, hospitality, and bribes from interests under their jurisdiction has been a particularly flagrant abuse of public trust. We shall bring all contacts with commissioners into the open, and will protect them from any form of improper pressure. We shall appoint to these agencies men of ability and independent judgment who understand that their function is to regulate these industries in the public interest. We promise a thorough review of existing agency practices, with an eye toward speedier decisions, and a clearer definition of what constitutes the public interest. The Democratic Party condemns the usurpation by the Executive of the powers and functions of any of the independent agencies and pledges the restoration of the independence of such agencies and the protection of their integrity of action. The Postal Service The Republican policy has been to treat the United States postal service as a liability instead of a great investment in national enlightenment, social efficiency and economic betterment. Constant curtailment of service has inconvenienced every citizen. A program must be undertaken to establish the Post Office Department as a model of efficiency and service. We pledge ourselves to: 1. Restore the principle that the postal service is a public service. 2. Separate the public service costs from those to be borne by the users of the mails. 3. Continue steady improvement in working conditions and wage scales, reflecting increasing productivity. 4. Establish a long range program for research and capital improvements compatible with the highest standards of business efficiency. Law Enforcement In recent years, we have been faced with a shocking increase in crimes of all kinds. Organized criminals have even infiltrated into legitimate business enterprises and labor unions. The Republican Administration, particularly the Attorney General's office, has failed lamentably to deal with this problem despite the growing power of the underworld. The new Democratic Administration will take vigorous corrective action. Freedom of Information We reject the Republican contention that the workings of Government are the special private preserve of the Executive. The massive wall of secrecy erected between the Executive branch and the Congress as well as the citizen must be torn down. Information must flow freely, save in those areas in which the national security is involved. Clean Elections The Democratic Party favors realistic and effective limitations on contributions and expenditures, and full disclosure of campaign financing in Federal elections. We further propose a tax credit to encourage small contributions to political parties. The Democratic Party affirms that every candidate for public office has a moral obligation to observe and uphold traditional American principles of decency, honesty and fair play in his campaign for election. We deplore efforts to divide the United States into regional and ethnic groups. We denounce and repudiate campaign tactics that substitute smear and slander, bigotry and false accusations of bigotry, for truth and reasoned argument. District of Columbia The capital city of our nation should be a symbol of democracy to people throughout the world. The Democratic Party reaffirms its long-standing support of home rule for the District of Columbia, and pledges to enact legislation permitting voters of the District to elect their own local government. We urge the legislatures of the 50 states to ratify the 23rd Amendment passed by the Democratic Congress to give Distict citizens the right to participate in Presidential elections. We also support a Constitutional amendment giving the District voting representation in Congress. Virgin Islands We believe that the voters of the Virgin Islands should have the right to elect their own Governor, to have a delegate in the Congress of the United States and to have the right to vote in national elections for a President and Vice President of the United States. Puerto Rico The social, economic, and political progress of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is a testimonial to the sound enabling legislation, and to the sincerity and understanding with which the people of the 50 states and Puerto Rico are meeting their joint problems. The Democratic Party, under whose administration the Commonwealth status was established, is entitled to great credit for providing the opportunity which the people of Puerto Rico have used so successfully. Puerto Rico has become a show place of world-wide interest, a tribute to the benefits of the principles of self-determination. Further benefits for Puerto Rico under these principles are certain to follow. CONGRESSIONAL PROCEDURES In order that the will of the American people may be expressed upon all legislative proposals, we urge that action be taken at the beginning of the 87th Congress to improve Congressional procedures so that majority rule prevails and decisions can be made after reasonable debate without being blocked by a minority in either House. The rules of the House of Representatives should be so amended as to make sure that bills reported by legislative committees reach the floor for consideration without undue delay. CONSUMERS In an age of mass production, distribution, and advertising, consumers require effective Government representation and protection. The Republican Administration has allowed the Food and Drug Administration to be weakened. Recent Senate hearings on the drug industry have revealed how flagrant profiteering can be when essential facts on costs, prices, and profits are hidden from scrutiny. The new Democratic Administration will provide the money and the authority to strengthen this agency for its task. We propose a consumer counsel, backed by a suitable staff, to speak for consumers in the formulation of Government policies and represent consumers in administrative proceedings. The consumer also has a right to know the cost of credit when he borrows money. We shall enact Federal legislation requiring to vendors of credit to provide a statement of specific credit charges and what these charges cost in terms of true annual interest. VETERANS AFFAIRS We adhere to the American tradition dating from the Plymouth Conony in New England in 1636: ""any soldier injured in defense of the colony shall be maintained competently by the colony for the remainder of his life."" We pledge adequate compensation for those with service connected disabilities and for the survivors of those who died in service or from service-connected disabilities. We pledge pensions adequate for a full and dignified life for disabled and distressed veterans and for needy survivors of deceased veterans. Veterans of World War I whose Federal benefits have not matched those of veterans of subsequent service, will receive the special attention of the Democratic Party looking toward equitable adjustments. We endorse expanded programs of vocational rehabilitation for disabled veterans, and education for orphans of servicemen. The quality of medical care furnished to the disabled veterans has deteriorated under the Republican Administration. We shall work for an increased availability of facilities for all veterans in need and we shall move with particular urgency to fulfull the need for expanded domiciliary and nursing-home facilities. We shall continue the veterans home loan guarantee and direct loan programs and educational benefits patterned after the G.I. Bill of Rights. AMERICAN INDIANS We recognize the unique legal and moral responsibility of the Federal Government for Indians in restitution for the injustice that has sometimes been done them. We therefore pledge prompt adoption of a program to assist Indian tribes in the full development of their human and natural resources and to advance the health, education, and economic well-being of Indian citizens while preserving their cultural heritage. Free consent of the Indian tribes concerned shall be required before the Federal Government makes any change in any Federal Indian treaty or other contractual relationship. The new Democratic Administration will bring competent, sympathetic, and dedicated leadership to the administration of Indian affairs which will end practices that have eroded Indian rights and resources, reduced the Indians land base and repudiated Federal responsibility. Indian claims against the United States can and will be settled promptly, whether by negotiation or other means, in the best interests of both parties. THE ARTS The arts flourish where there is freedom and where individual initiative and imagination are encouraged. We enjoy the blessings of such an atmosphere. The nation should begin to evaluate the possibilities for encouraging and expanding participation in and appreciation of our cultural life. We propose a federal advisory agency to assist in the evaluation, development, and expansion of cultural resources of the united-states. we shall support legislation needed to provide incentives for those endowed with extraordinary talent, as a worthy supplement to existing scholarship programs. CIVIL LIBERTIES With democratic values threatened today by Communist tyranny, we reaffirm our dedication to the Bill of Rights. Freedom and civil liberties, far from being incompatible with security, are vital to our national strength. Unfortunately, those high in the Republican Administration have all too often sullied the name and honor of loyal and faithful American citizens in and out of Government. The Democratic Party will strive to improve Congressional investigating and hearing procedures. We shall abolish useless disclaimer affidavits such as those for student educational loans. We shall provide a full and fair hearing, including confrontation of the accuser, to any person whose public or private employment or reputation is jeopardized by a loyalty or security proceeding. Protection of rights of American citizens to travel, to pursue lawful trade and to engage in other lawful activities abroad without distinction as to race or religion is a cardinal function of the national sovereignty. We will oppose any international agreement or treaty which by its terms or practices differentiates among American citizens on grounds of race or religion. The list of unfinished business for America is long. The accumulated neglect of nearly a decade cannot be wiped out overnight. Many of the objectives which we seek will require our best efforts over a period of years. Although the task is far-reaching, we will tackle it with vigor and confidence. We will substitute planning for confusion, purpose for indifference, direction for drift and apathy. We will organize the policymaking machinery of the Executive branch to provide vigor and leadership in establishing our national goals and achieving them. The new Democratic President will sign, not veto, the efforts of a Democratic Congress to create more jobs, to build more homes, to save family farms, to clean up polluted streams and rivers, to help depressed areas, and to provide full employment for our people. FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY We vigorously reject the notion that America, with a half trillion-dollar gross national product, and nearly half of the world's industrial resources, cannot afford to meet our needs at home and in our world relationships. We believe, moreover, that except in periods of recession or national emergency, these needs can be met with a balanced budget, with no increase in present tax rates, and with some surplus for the gradual reduction of our national debt. To assure such a balance we shall pursue a four-point program of fiscal responsibility. First, we shall end the gross waste in Federal expenditures which needlessly raises the budgets of many Government agencies. The most conspicuous unnecessary item is, of course, the excessive cost of interest on the national debt. Courageous action to end duplication and competition among the armed services will achieve large savings. The cost of the agricultural program can be reduced while at the same time prosperity is being restored to the nation's farmers. Second, we shall collect the billions in taxes which are owed to the Federal Government but not now collected. The Internal Revenue Service is still suffering from the cuts inflicted upon its enforcement staff by the Republican Administration and the Republican Congress in 1953. The Administration's own Commissioner of Internal Revenue has testified that billions of dollars in revenue are lost each year because of the Service does not have sufficient agents to follow up on tax evasion. We will add enforcement personnel, and develop new techniques of enforcement, to collect tax revenue which is now being lost through evasion. Third, we shall close the loopholes in the tax laws by which certain privileged groups legally escape their fair share of taxation. Among the more conspicuous loopholes are depletion allowances which are inequitable, special consideration for recipients of dividend income, and deductions for extravagant ""business expenses"" which have reached scandalous proportions. Tax reform can raise additional revenue and at the same time increase legitimate incentives for growth, and make it possible to ease the burden on the general taxpayer who now pays an unfair share of taxes because of special favors to the few. Fourth, we shall bring in added Federal tax revenues by expanding the economy itself. Each dollar of additional production puts an additional 18 cents in tax revenue in the national treasury. A five percent growth rate, therefore, will mean that at the end of four years the Federal Government will have had a total of nearly 50 billion dollars in additional tax revenues above those presently received. By these four methods we can sharply increase the Government funds available for needed services, for correction of tax inequities, and for debt or tax reduction. Much of the challenge of the 1960s, however, remains unforeseen and unforeseeable. If, therefore, the unfolding demands of the new decade at home or abroad should impose clear national responsibilities that cannot be fulfilled without higher taxes, we will not allow political disadvantage to deter us from doing what is required. As we proceed with the urgent task of restoring America's productivity, confidence, and power we will never forget that our national interest is more than the sum total of all the group interests in America. When group interests conflict with the national interest, it will be the national interest which we serve. On its values and goals the quality of American life depends. Here above all our national interest and our devotion to the Rights of Man coincide. Democratic Administrations under Wilson, Roosevelt, and Truman led the way in pressing for economic justice for all Americans. But man does not live by bread alone. A new Democratic Administration, like its predecessors, will once again look beyond material goals to the spiritual meaning of American society. We have drifted into a national mood that accepts payola and quiz scandals, tax evasion and false expense accounts, soaring crime rates, influence peddling in high Government circles, and the exploitation of sadistic violence as popular entertainment. For eight long critical years our present national leadership has made no effective effort to reverse this mood. The new Democratic Administration will help create a sense of national purpose and higher standards of public behavior. CIVIL RIGHTS We shall also seek to create an affirmative new atmosphere in which to deal with racial divisions and inequalities which threaten both the integrity of our democratic faith and the proposition on which our nation was founded, that all men are created equal. It is our faith in human dignity that distinguishes our open free society from the closed totalitarian society of the Communists. The Constitution of the United States rejects the notion that the Rights of Man means the rights of some men only. We reject it too. The right to vote is the first principle of self-government. The Constitution also guarantees to all Americans the equal protection of the laws. It is the duty of the Congress to enact the laws necessary and proper to protect and promote these constitutional rights. The Supreme Court has the power to interpret these rights and the laws thus enacted. It is the duty of the President to see that these rights are respected and that the Constitution and laws as interpreted by the Supreme Court are faithfully executed. What is now required is effective moral and political leadership by the whole Executive branch of our Government to make equal opportunity a living reality for all Americans. As the party of Jefferson, we shall provide that leadership. In every city and state in greater or lesser degree there is discrimination based on color, race, religion, or national origin. If discrimination in voting, education, the administration of justice or segregated lunch counters are the issues in one area, discrimination in housing and employment may be pressing questions elsewhere. The peaceful demonstrations for first-class citizenship which have recently taken place in many parts of this country are a signal to all of us to make good at long last the guarantees of our constitution. The time has come to assure equal access for all americans to all areas of community life, including voting booths, schoolrooms, jobs, housing, and public facilities. The Democratic Administration which takes office next January will therefore use the full powers provided in the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960 to secure for all Americans the right to vote. If these powers, vigorously invoked by a new Attorney General and backed by a strong and imaginative Democratic President prove inadequate, further powers will be sought. We will support whatever action is necessary to eliminate literacy tests and the payment of poll taxes as requirements for voting. A new Democratic Administration will also use its full powers, legal and moral, to ensure the beginning of good faith compliance with the Constitutional requirement that racial discrimination be ended in public education. We believe that every school district affected by the Supreme Court's school desegregation decision should submit a plan providing for at least first step compliance by 1963, the 100th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation. To facilitate compliance, technical and financial assistance should be given to school districts facing special problems of transition. For this and for the protection of all other Constitutional rights of Americans, the Attorney General should be empowered and directed to file civil injunction suits in Federal courts to prevent the denial of any civil right on grounds of race, creed, or color. The new Democratic Administration will support Federal legislation establishing a Fair Employment Practices Commission to secure effectively for everyone the right of equal opportunity for employment. In 1949 the President's Committee on Civil Rights recommended a permanent Commission on Civil Rights. The new Democratic Administration will broaden the scope and strengthen the powers of the present commission and make it permanent.  Its functions will be to provide assistance to communities, industries, or individuals in the implementation of Constitutional rights in education, housing, employment, transportation, and the administration of justice. In addition, the Democratic Administration will use its full executive powers to assure equal employment opportunities and to terminate racial segregation throughout Federal services and institutions, and on all Government contracts. The sucessful desegregation of the armed services took place through such decisive executive action under President Truman. Similarly the new Democratic Administration will take action to end discrimination in federal housing programs, including Federally assisted housing. To accomplish these goals will require executive orders, legal actions brought by the Attorney General, legislation, and improved Congressional procedures to safeguard majority rule. Above all, it will require the strong, active, persuasive, and inventive leadership of the President of the United States. The Democratic President who takes office next January will face unprecedented challenges. His Administration will present a new face to the world. It will be a bold, confident, affirmative face. We will draw new strength from the universal truths which the founder of our Party asserted in the Declaration of Independence to be ""self evident"". Emerson once spoke of an unending contest in human affairs, a contest between the Party of Hope and the Party of Memory. For seven and one-half years America, governed by the Party of Memory, has taken a holiday from history. As the Party of Hope it is our responsibility and opportunity to call forth the greatness of the American people. In this spirit, we hereby rededicate ourselves to the continuing service of the Rights of Man everywhere in America and everywhere else on God's earth.",104733,16179,"in , in america's first contested national election, our party, under the leadership of thomas jefferson, campaigned on the principles of ""the rights of man"". ever since, these four words have underscored our identity with the plain people of america and the world. in periods of national crises we democrats have returned to these words for renewed strength. we return to them today. in , ""the rights of man"" are still the issue. it is our continuing responsibility to provide an effective instrument of political action for every american who seeks to strengthen these rights everywhere here in america, and everywhere in our 20th century world. the common danger of mankind is war and the threat of war. today, three billion human beings live in fear that some rash act or blunder may plunge us all into a nuclear holocaust which will leave only ruined cities, blasted homes, and a poisoned earth and sky. our objective, however, is not the right to coexist in armed camps on the same planet with totalitarian ideologies it is the creation of an enduring peace in which the universal values of human dignity, truth, and justice under law are finally secured for all men everywhere on earth. if america is to work effectively for such a peace, we must first restore our national strength--military, political, economic, and moral. national defense the new democratic administration will recast our military capacity in order to provide forces and weapons of a diversity, balance, and mobility sufficient in quantity and quality to deter both limited and general aggressions. when the democratic administration left office in the united states was the pre-eminent power in the world. most free nations had confidence in our will and our ability to carry out our commitments to the common defense. even those who wished us ill respected our power and influence. the republican administration has lost that position of pre eminence. over the past seven and one-half years, our military power has steadily declined relative to that of the russians and the chinese and their satellites. this is not a partisan election-year charge. it has been persistently made by high officials of the republican administration itself. before congressional committees they have testified that the communists will have a dangerous lead in intercontinental missiles through and that the republican administration has no plans to catch up. they have admitted that the soviet union leads in the space race and that they have no plans to catch up. they have also admitted that our conventional military forces, on which we depend for defense in any non-nuclear war, have been dangerously slashed for reasons of ""economy"" and that they have no plans to reverse this trend. as a result, our military position today is measured in terms of gaps, missile gap, space gap, limited-war gap. to recover from the errors of the past seven and one-half years will not be easy. this is the strength that must be erected: . deterrent military power such that the soviet and chinese leaders will have no doubt that an attack on the united states would surely be followed by their own destruction. . balanced conventional military forces which will permit a response graded to the intensity of any threats of aggressive force. . continuous modernization of these forces through intensified research and development, including essential programs now slowed down, terminated, suspended, or neglected for lack of budgetary support. a first order of business of a democratic administration will be a complete re-examination of the organization of our armed forces. a military organization structure, conceived before the revolution in weapons technology, cannot be suitable for the strategic deterrent, continental defense, limited war, and military alliance requirements of the nineteen sixties. we believe that our armed forces should be organized more nearly on the basis of function, not only to produce greater military strength, but also to eliminate duplication and save substantial sums. we pledge our will, energies and resources to oppose communist aggression. since world war ii it has been clear that our own security must be pursued in concert with that of many other nations. the democratic administrations which in world war ii led in forging a mighty and victorious alliance, took the initiative after the war in creating the north atlantic treaty organization-- the greatest peacetime alliance in history. this alliance has made it possible to keep western europe and the atlantic community secure against communist pressures. our present system of alliances was begun in a time of an earlier weapons technology when our ability to retaliate against communist attack required bases all around the periphery of the soviet union. today, because of our continuing weakness in mobile weapons systems and intercontinental missiles, our defenses still depend in part on bases beyond our borders for planes and shorter range missiles. if an alliance is to be maintained in vigor, its unity must be reflected in shared purposes. some of our allies have contributed neither devotion to the cause of freedom nor any real military strength. the new democratic administration will review our system of pacts and alliances. we shall continue to adhere to our treaty obligations, including the commitment of the un charter to resist aggression. but we shall also seek to shift the emphasis of our cooperation from military aid to economic development, wherever this is possible. civil defense we commend the work of the civil defense groups throughout the nation. a strong and effective civil defense is an essential element in our nation's defense. the new democratic administration will undertake a full review and analysis of the programs that should be adopted if the protection possible is to be provided to the civilian population of our nation. arms control a fragile power balance sustained by mutual nuclear terror does not, however, constitute peace. we must regain the initiative on the entire international front with effective new policies to create the conditions for peace. there are no simple solutions to the infinitely complex challenges which face us. mankind's eternal dream, a world of peace, can only be built slowly and patiently. a primary task is to develop responsible proposals that will help break the deadlock on arms control. such proposals should include means for ending nuclear tests under workable safeguards, cutting back nuclear weapons, reducing conventional forces, preserving outer space for peaceful purposes, preventing surprise attack, and limiting the risk of accidental war. this requires a national peace agency for disarmament planning and research to muster the scientific ingenuity, coordination, continuity, and seriousness of purpose which are now lacking in our arms control efforts. the national peace agency would develop the technical and scientific data necessary for serious disarmament negotiations, would conduct research in cooperation with the defense department and atomic energy commission on methods of inspection and monitoring arms control agreements particularly agreements to control nuclear testing, and would provide continuous technical advice to our disarmament negotiators. as with armaments, so with disarmaments, the republican administration has provided us with much talk but little constructive action. representatives of the united states have gone to conferences without plans or preparation. the administration has played opportunistic politics, both at home and abroad. even during the recent important negotiations at geneva and paris, only a handful of people were devoting full time to work on the highly complex problem of disarmament. more than billion dollars of the world's production now goes each year into armaments. to the extent that we can secure the adoption of effective arms control agreements, vast resources will be freed for peaceful use. the new democratic administration will plan for an orderly shift of our expenditures. long-delayed reductions in excise, corporation, and individual income taxes will then be possible. we can also step-up the pace in meeting our backlog of public needs and in pursuing the promise of atomic and space science in a peaceful age. as world-wide disarmament proceeds, it will free vast resources for a new international attack on the problem of world poverty. the instruments of foreign policy american foreign policy in all its aspects must be attuned to our world of change. we will recruit officials whose experience, humanity, and dedication fit them for the task of effectively representing america abroad. we will provide a more sensitive and creative direction to our overseas information program. and we will overhaul our administrative machinery so that america may avoid diplomatic embarrassments and at long last speak with a single confident voice in world affairs. the ""image"" of america first, those men and women selected to represent us abroad must be chosen for their sensitive understanding of the peoples with whom they will live. we can no longer afford representatives who are ignorant of the language and culture and politics of the nations in which they represent us. our information programs must be more than news broadcasts and boastful recitals of our accomplishments and our material riches. we must find ways to show the people of the world that we share the same goals dignity health freedom schools for children a place in the sun and that we will work together to achieve them. our program of visits between americans and people of other nations will be expanded, with special emphasis upon students and younger leaders. we will encourage study of foreign languages. we favor continued support and extension of such programs as the east-west cultural center established at the university of hawaii. we shall study a similar center for latin america with due consideration of the existing facilities now available in the canal zone. national policy machinery in the present administration, the national security council has been used not to focus issues for decision by the responsible leaders of government, but to paper over problems of policy with ""agreed solutions"" which avoid decisions. the mishandling of the u- espionage flights, the sorry spectacle of official denial, retraction, and contradiction and the admitted misjudging of japanese public opinion are only two recent examples of the breakdown of the administration's machinery for assembling facts, making decisions, and coordinating action. the democratic party welcomes the study now being made by the senate subcommittee on national policy machinery. the new democratic administration will revamp and simplify this cumbersome machinery. world trade world trade is more than ever essential to world peace. in the tradition of cordell hull, we shall expand world trade in every responsible way. since all americans share the benefits of this policy, its costs should not be the burden of a few. we shall support practical measures to ease the necessary adjustments of industries and communities which may be unavoidably hurt by increases in imports. world trade raises living standards, widens markets, reduces costs, increases profits, and builds political stability and international economic cooperation. however, the increase in foreign imports involves costly adjustment and damage to some domestic industries and communities. the burden has been heavier recently because of the republican failure to maintain an adequate rate of economic growth, and the refusal to use public programs to ease necessary adjustments. the democratic administration will help industries affected by foreign trade with measures favorable to economic growth, orderly transition, fair competition, and the long-run economic strength of all parts of our nation. industries and communities affected by foreign trade need and deserve appropriate help through trade adjustment measures such as direct loans, tax incentives, defense contracts priority, and retraining assistance. our government should press for reduction of foreign barriers to the sale of the products of american industry and agriculture. these are particularly severe in the case of fruit products. the present balance-of-payments situation provides a favorable opportunity for such action. the new democratic administration will seek international agreements to assure fair competition and fair labor standards to protect our own workers and to improve the lot of workers elsewhere. our domestic economic policies and our essential foreign policies must be harmonious. to sell, we must buy. we therefore must resist the temptation to accept remedies that deny american producers and consumers access to world markets and destroy the prosperity of our friends in the non-communist world. immigration we shall adjust our immigration, nationality and refugee policies to eliminate discrimination and to enable members of scattered families abroad to be united with relatives already in our midst. the national-origins quota system of limiting immigration contradicts the founding principles of this nation. it is inconsistent with our belief in the rights of man. this system was instituted after world war i as a policy of deliberate discrimination by a republican administration and congress. the revision of immigration and nationality laws we seek will implement our belief that enlightened immigration, naturalization and refugee policies and humane administration of them are important aspects of our foreign policy. these laws will bring greater skills to our land reunite families permit the united states to meet its fair share of world programs of rescue and rehabilitation, and take advantage of immigration as an important factor in the growth of the american economy. in this world refugee year it is our hope to achieve admission of our fair share of refugees. we will institute policies to alleviate suffering among the homeless wherever we are able to extend our aid. we must remove the distinctions between native born and naturalized citizens to assure full protection of our laws to all. there is no place in the united states for ""second-class citizenship"". the protections provided by due process, right of appeal, and statutes of limitation, can be extended to non-citizens without hampering the security of our nation. we commend the democratic congress for the initial steps that have recently been taken toward liberalizing changes in immigration law. however, this should not be a piecemeal project and we are confident that a democratic president in cooperation with democratic congresses will again implant a humanitarian and liberal spirit in our nation's immigration and citizenship policies. to the peoples and governments beyond our shores we offer the following pledges: the underdeveloped world to the non-communist nations of asia, africa, and latin america: we shall create with you working partnerships based on mutual respect and understanding. in the jeffersonian tradition, we recognize and welcome the irresistible momentum of the world revolution of rising expectations for a better life. we shall identify american policy with the values and objectives of this revolution. to this end the new democratic administration will revamp and refocus the objectives, emphasis and allocation of our foreign assistance programs. the proper purpose of these programs is not to buy gratitude or to recruit mercenaries, but to enable the peoples of these awakening, developing nations to make their own free choices. as they achieve a sense of belonging, of dignity, and of justice, freedom will become meaningful for them, and therefore worth defending. where military assistance remains essential for the common defense, we shall see that the requirements are fully met. but as rapidly as security considerations permit, we will replace tanks with tractors, bombers with bulldozers, and tacticians with technicians. we shall place our programs of international cooperation on a long-term basis to permit more effective planning. we shall seek to associate other capital-exporting countries with us in promoting the orderly economic growth of the underdeveloped world. we recognize india and pakistan as major tests of the capacity of free men in a difficult environment to master the age old problems of illiteracy, poverty, and disease. we will support their efforts in every practical way. we welcome the emerging new nations of africa to the world community. here again we shall strive to write a new chapter of fruitful cooperation. in latin america we shall restore the good neighbor policy based on far closer economic cooperation and increased respect and understanding. in the middle east we will work for guarantees to insure independence for all states. we will encourage direct arab israeli peace negotiations, the resettlement of arab refugees in lands where there is room and opportunity for them, an end to boycotts and blockades, and unrestricted use of the suez canal by all nations. a billion and a half people in asia, africa, and latin america are engaged in an unprecedented attempt to propel themselves into the 20th century. they are striving to create or reaffirm their national identity. but they want much more than independence. they want an end to grinding poverty. they want more food, health for themselves and their children, and other benefits that a modern industrial civilization can provide. communist strategy has sought to divert these aspirations into narrowly nationalistic channels, or external troublemaking, or authoritarianism. the republican administration has played into the hands of this strategy by concerning itself almost exclusively with the military problem of communist invasion. the democratic programs of economic cooperation will be aimed at making it as easy as possible for the political leadership in these countries to turn the energy, talent and resources of their peoples to orderly economic growth. history and current experience show that an annual per capita growth rate of at least percent is feasible in these countries. the democratic administration's assistance program, in concert with the aid forthcoming from our partners in western europe, japan, and the british commonwealth, will be geared to facilitating this objective. the democratic administration will recognize that assistance to these countries is not an emergency or short-term matter. through the development loan fund and otherwise, we shall seek to assure continuity in our aid programs for periods of at least five years, in order to permit more effective allocation on our part and better planning by the governments of the countries receiving aid. more effective use of aid and a greater confidence in us and our motives will be the result. we shall establish priorities for foreign aid which will channel it to those countries abroad which, by their own willingness to help themselves, show themselves most capable of using it effectively. we shall use our own agricultural productivity as an effective tool of foreign aid, and also as a vital form of working capital for economic development. we shall seek new approaches which will provide assistance without disrupting normal world markets for food and fiber. we shall give attention to the problem of stabilizing world prices of agricultural commodities and basic raw materials on which many underdeveloped countries depend for needed foreign exchange. we shall explore the feasibility of shipping and storing a substantial part of our food abundance in a system of ""food banks"" located at distribution centers in the underdeveloped world. such a system would be an effective means of alleviating famine and suffering in times of natural disaster, and of cushioning the effect of bad harvests. it would also have a helpful anti-inflationary influence as economic development gets under way. although basic development requirements like transport, housing, schools, and river development may be financed by government, these projects are usually built and sometimes managed by private enterprise. moreover, outside this public sector a large and increasing role remains for private investment. the republican administration has done little to summon american business to play its part in this, one of the most creative tasks of our generation. the democratic administration will take steps to recruit and organize effectively the best business talent in america for foreign economic development. we urge continued economic assistance to israel and the arab peoples to help them raise their living standards. we pledge our best efforts for peace in the middle east by seeking to prevent an arms race while guarding against the dangers of a military imbalance resulting from soviet arms shipments. the atlantic community to our friends and associates in the atlantic community: we propose a broader partnership that goes beyond our common fears to recognize the depth and sweep of our common political, economic, and cultural interests. we welcome the recent heartening advances toward european unity. in every appropriate way, we shall encourage their further growth within the broader framework of the atlantic community. after world war ii democratic statesmen saw that an orderly, peaceful world was impossible with europe shattered and exhausted. they fashioned the great programs which bear their names, the truman doctrine and the marshall plan by which the economies of europe were revived. then in nato they renewed for the common defense the ties of alliance forged in war. in these endeavors, the democratic administrations invited leading republicans to full participation as equal partners. but the republican administration has rejected this principle of bi partisanship. we have already seen how the mutual trust and confidence created abroad under democratic leadership have been eroded by arrogance, clumsiness, and lack of understanding in the republican administration. the new democratic administration will restore the former high levels of cooperation within the atlantic community envisaged from the beginning by the nato treaty in political and economic spheres as well as military affairs. we welcome the progress towards european unity expressed in the coal and steel community euratom the european economic community the european free trade association and the european assembly. we shall conduct our relations with the nations of the common market so as to encourage the opportunities for freer and more expanded trade, and to avert the possibilities of discrimination that are inherent in it. we shall encourage adjustment with the so-called ""outer seven"" nations so as to enlarge further the area of freer trade. the communist world to the rulers of the communist world: we confidently accept your challenge to competition in every field of human effort. we recognize this contest as one between two radically different approaches to the meaning of life, our open society which places its highest value upon individual dignity, and your closed society in which the rights of men are sacrificed to the state. we believe your communist ideology to be sterile, unsound, and doomed to failure. we believe that your children will reject the intellectual prison in which you seek to confine them, and that ultimately they will choose the eternal principles of freedom. in the meantime, we are prepared to negotiate with you whenever and wherever there is a realistic possibility of progress without sacrifice of principle. if negotiations through diplomatic channels provide opportunities we will negotiate. if debate before the united nations holds promise, we will debate. if meetings at high level offer prospects of success, we will be there. but we will use all the power, resources, and energy at our command to resist the further encroachment of communism on freedom, whether at berlin, formosa, or new points of pressure as yet undisclosed. we will keep open the lines of communication with our opponents. despite difficulties in the way of peaceful agreements, every useful avenue will be energetically explored and pursued. however, we will never surrender positions which are essential to the defense of freedom nor will we abandon peoples who are now behind the iron curtain through any formal approval of the status quo. everyone proclaims ""firmness"" in support of berlin. the issue is not the desire to be firm, but the capability to be firm. this the democratic party will provide as it has done before. the ultimate solution of the situation in berlin must be approached in the broader context of settlement of the tensions and divisions of europe. the good faith of the united states is pledged likewise to defending formosa. we will carry out that pledge. the new democratic administration will also reaffirm our historic policy of opposition to the establishment anywhere in the americas of governments dominated by foreign powers, a policy now being undermined by soviet threats to the freedom and independence of cuba. the government of the united states under a democratic administration will not be deterred from fulfilling its obligations and solemn responsibilities under its treaties and agreements with the nations of the western hemisphere. nor will the united states in conformity with its treaty obligations permit the establishment of a regime dominated by international, atheistic communism in the western hemisphere. to the people who live in the communist world and its captive nations: we proclaim an enduring friendship which goes beyond governments and ideologies to our common human interest in a better world. through exchanges of persons, cultural contacts, trade in non-strategic areas, and other non-governmental activities, we will endeavor to preserve and improve opportunities for human relationships which no iron curtain can permanently sever. no political platform promise in history was more cruelly cynical than the republican effort to buy votes in with false promises of painless liberation for the captive nations. the blood of heroic freedom fighters in hungary tragically proved this promise a fraud. we democrats will never be party to such cruel cultivation of false hopes. we look forward to the day when the men and women of albania, bulgaria, czechoslovakia, east germany, estonia, hungary, latvia, lithuania, poland, rumania, and the other captive nations will stand again in freedom and justice. we will hasten, by every honorable and responsible means, the arrival of the day. we shall never accept any deal or arrangement which acquiesces in the present subjugation of these peoples. we deeply regret that the policies and actions of the government of communist china have interrupted the generations of friendship between the chinese and american peoples. we reaffirm our pledge of determined opposition to the present admission of communist china to the united nations. although normal diplomatic relations between our governments are impossible under present conditions, we shall welcome any evidence that the chinese communist government is genuinely prepared to create a new relationship based on respect for international obligations, including the release of american prisoners. we will continue to make every effort to effect the release of american citizens and servicemen now injustly imprisoned in communist china and elsewhere in the communist empire. the united nations to all our fellow members of the united nations: we shall strengthen our commitments in this, our great continuing institution for conciliation and the growth of a world community. through the machinery of the united nations we shall work for disarmament the establishment of an international police force, the strengthening of the world court, and the establishment of world law. we shall propose the bolder and more effective use of the specialized agencies to promote the world's economic and social development. great democratic presidents have taken the lead in the effort to unite the nations of the world in an international organization to assure world peace with justice under law. the league of nations conceived by woodrow wilson was doomed by repubican defeat of united states participation. the united nations sponsored by franklin roosevelt, has become the one place where representatives of the rival systems and interests which divide the world can and do maintain continuous contact. the united states adherence to the world court contains a so called ""self-judging reservation"" which, in effect, permits us to prevent a court decision in any particular case in which we are involved. the democratic party proposes its repeal. to all these endeavors so essential to world peace, we, the members of the democratic party, will bring a new urgency, persistence, and determination, born of the conviction that in our thermonuclear century all of the other rights of man hinge on our ability to assure man's right to peace. the pursuit of peace, our contribution to the stability of the new nations of the world, our hopes for progress and well being at home, all these depend in large measure on our ability to release the full potential of our american economy for employment, production, and growth. our generation of americans has achieved a historic technological breakthrough. today we are capable of creating an abundance in goods and services beyond the dreams of our parents. yet on the threshold of plenty the republican administration hesitates, confused and afraid. as a result, massive human needs now exist side by side with idle workers, idle capital, and idle machines. the republican failure in the economic field has been virtually complete. their years of power have consisted of two recessions, in - and -, separated by the most severe peacetime inflation in history. they have shown themselves incapable of checking inflation. in their efforts to do so, they have brought on recessions that have thrown millions of americans out of work. yet even in these slumps, the cost of living has continued to climb, and it is now at an all-time high. they have slowed down the rate of growth of the economy to about one-third the rate of the soviet union. over the past and one-half year period, the republicans have failed to balance the budget or reduce the national debt. responsible fiscal policy requires surpluses in good times to more than offset the deficits which may occur in recessions, in order to reduce the national debt over the long run. the republican administration has produced the deficits, in fact, the greatest deficit in any peacetime year in history, in -, but only occasional and meager surpluses. their first seven years produced a total deficit of nearly billion dollars. while reducing outlays for essential public services which directly benefit our people, they have raised the annual interest charge on the national debt to a level billion dollars higher than when they took office. in the eight fiscal years of the republican administration, these useless higher interest payments will have cost the taxpayer billion dollars. they have mismanaged the public debt not only by increasing interest rates, but also by failing to lengthen the average maturity of government obligations when they had a clear opportunity to do so. economic growth the new democratic administration will confidently proceed to unshackle american enterprise and to free american labor, industrial leadership, and capital, to create an abundance that will outstrip any other system. free competitive enterprise is the most creative and productive form of economic order that the world has seen. the recent slow pace of american growth is due not to the failure of our free economy but to the failure of our national leadership. we democrats believe that our economy can and must grow at an average rate of percent annually, almost twice as fast as our average annual rate since . we pledge ourselves to policies that will achieve this goal without inflation. economic growth is the means whereby we improve the american standard of living and produce added tax resources for national security and essential public services. our economy must grow more swiftly in order to absorb two groups of workers, the much larger number of young people who will be reaching working age in the 1960s, and the workers displaced by the rapid pace of technological advances, including automation. republican policies which have stifled growth could only mean increasingly severe unemployment, particularly of youth and older workers. an end to tight money as the first step in speeding economic growth, a democratic president will put an end to the present high interest, tight money policy. this policy has failed in its stated purpose to keep prices down. it has given us two recessions within five years, bankrupted many of our farmers, produced a record number of business failures, and added billions of dollars in unnecessary higher interest charges to government budgets and the cost of living. a new democratic administration will reject this philosophy of economic slowdown. we are committed to maximum employment, at decent wages and with fair profits, in a far more productive, expanding economy. the repblican high-interest policy has extracted a costly toll from every american who has financed a home, an automobile, a refrigerator, or a television set. it has foisted added burdens on taxpayers of state and local governments which must borrow for schools and other public services. it has added to the cost of many goods and services, and hence has been itself a factor in inflation. it has created windfalls for many financial institutions. the nine billion dollars of added interest charges on the national debt would have been even higher but for the prudent insistence of the democratic congress that the ceiling on interest rates for long-term government bonds be maintained. control of inflation the american consumer has a right to fair prices. we are determined to secure that right. inflation has its roots in a variety of causes, its cure lies in a variety of remedies. among those remedies are monetary and credit policies properly applied, budget surpluses in times of full employment, and action to restrain ""administered price"" increases in industries where economic power rests in the hands of a few. a fair share of the gains from increasing productivity in many industries should be passed on to the consumer through price reductions. the agenda which a new democratic administration will face next january is crowded with urgent needs on which action has been delayed, deferred, or denied by the present administration. a new democratic administration will undertake to meet those needs. it will reaffirm the economic bill of rights which franklin roosevelt wrote into our national conscience sixteen years ago. it will reaffirm these rights for all americans of whatever race, place of residence, or station in life, . ""the right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the nation."" full employment the democratic party reaffirms its support of full employment as a paramount objective of national policy. for nearly months the rate of unemployment has been between and and one-half percent of the labor force. a pool of three to four million citizens, able and willing to work but unable to find jobs, has been written off by the republican administration as a ""normal"" readjustment of the economic system. the policies of a democratic administration to restore economic growth will reduce current unemployment to a minimum. thereafter, if recessionary trends appear, we will act promptly with counter measures, such as public works or temporary tax cuts. we will not stand idly by and permit recessions to run their course as the republican administration has done. aid to depressed areas the right to a job requires action to create new industry in america's depressed areas of chronic unemployment. general economic measures will not alone solve the problem of localities which suffer some special disadvantage. to bring prosperity to these depressed areas and to enable them to make their full contribution to the national welfare, specially directed action is needed. areas of heavy and persistent unemployment result from depletion of natural resources, technological change, shifting defense requirements, or trade imbalances which have caused the decline of major industries. whole communities, urban and rural, have been left stranded in distress and despair, through no fault of their own. these communities have undertaken valiant efforts of self help. but mutual aid, as well as self-help, is part of the american tradition. stricken communities deserve the help of the whole nation. the democratic congress twice passed bills to provide this help. the republican president twice vetoed them. these bills proposed low-interest loans to private enterprise to create new industry and new jobs in depressed communities, assistance to the communities to provide public facilities necessary to encourage the new industry, and retraining of workers for the new jobs. the democratic congress will again pass, and the democratic president will sign, such a bill. discrimination in employment the right to a job requires action to break down artificial and arbitrary barriers to employment based on age race sex religion or national origin. unemployment strikes hardest at workers over , minority groups, young people, and women. we will not achieve full employment until prejudice against these workers is wiped out. collective bargaining the right to a job requires the restoration of full support for collective-bargaining and the repeal of the anti-labor excesses which have been written into our labor laws. under democratic leadership a sound national policy was developed, expressed particularly by the wagner national labor relations act, which guaranteed the rights of workers to organize and to bargain collectively. but the republican administration has replaced this sound policy with a national anti-labor policy. the republican taft-hartley act seriously weakened unions in their efforts to bring economic justice to the millions of american workers who remain unorganized. by administrative action anti-labor personnel appointed by the republicans to the national labor relations board have made the taft-hartley act even more restrictive in its application than in its language. thus the traditional goal of the democratic party, to give all workers the right to organize and bargain collectively, has still not been achieved. we pledge the enactment of an affirmative labor policy which will encourage free collective-bargaining through the growth and development of free and responsible unions. millions of workers just now seeking to organize are blocked by federally authorized ""right-to-work"" laws, unreasonable limitations on the right to picket, and other hampering legislative and administrative provisions. again, in the new labor-management reporting and disclosure act, the republican administration perverted the constructive effort of the democratic congress to deal with improper activities of a few in labor and management by turning that act into a means of restricting the legitimate rights of the vast majority of working men and women in honest labor unions. this law likewise strikes hardest at the weak or poorly organized, and it fails to deal with abuses of management as vigorously as with those of labor. we will repeal the authorization for ""right-to-work"" laws, limitations on the rights to strike, to picket peacefully and to tell the public the facts of a labor dispute, and other anti-labor features of the taft-hartley act and the act. this unequivocal pledge for the repeal of the anti-labor and restrictive provisions of those laws will encourage collective bargaining and strengthen and support the free and honest labor movement. the railroad retirement act and the railroad unemployment insurance act are in need of improvement. we strongly oppose republican attempts to weaken the railway labor act. we shall strengthen and modernize the walsh-healey and davis bacon acts, which protect the wage standards of workers employed by government contractors. basic to the achievement of stable labor-management relations is leadership from the white house. the republican administration has failed to provide such leadership. it failed to foresee the deterioration of labor-management relations in the steel industry last year. when a national emergency was obviously developing, it failed to forestall it. when the emergency came, the administration's only solution was government by injunction. a democratic president, through his leadership and concern, will produce a better climate for continuing constructive relationships between labor and management. he will have periodic white house conferences between labor and management to consider their mutual problems before then reach the critical stage. a democratic president will use the vast fact-finding facilities that are available to inform himself, and the public, in exercising his leadership in labor disputes for the benefit of the nation as a whole. if he needs more such facilities, or authority, we will provide them. we further pledge that in the administration of all labor legislation we will restore the level of integrity, competence and sympathetic understanding required to carry out the intent of such legislation. planning for automation the right to a job requires planning for automation, so that men and women will be trained and available to meet shifting employment needs. we will conduct a continuing analysis of the nation's manpower resources and of measures which may be required to assure their fullest development and use. we will provide the government leadership necessary to insure that the blessings of automation do not become burdens of widespread unemployment. for the young and the technologically displaced workers, we will provide the opportunity for training and retraining that equips them for jobs to be filled. minimum wages . ""the right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation."" at the bottom of the income scale are some eight million families whose earnings are too low to provide even basic necessities of food, shelter, and clothing. we pledge to raise the minimum wage to one dollar and twenty five cents per hour and to extend coverage to several million workers not now protected. we pledge further improvements in the wage, hour and coverage standards of the fair labor standards act so as to extend its benefits to all workers employed in industries engaged in or affecting interstate commerce and to raise its standards to keep up with our general economic progress and needs. we shall seek to bring the two million men, women and children who work for wages on the farms of the united states under the protection of existing labor and social legislation, and to assure migrant labor, perhaps the most underprivileged of all, of a comprehensive program to bring them not only decent wages but also adequate standards of health housing social security protection education and welfare services. agriculture . ""the right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living."" we shall take positive action to raise farm income to full parity levels and to preserve family farming as a way of life. we shall put behind us once and for all the timidity with which our government has viewed our abundance of food and fiber. we will set new high levels of food and consumption both at home and abroad. as long as many americans and hundreds of millions of people in other countries remain underfed, we shall regard these agricultural riches, and the family farmers who produce them, not as a liability but as a national asset. using our abundance the democratic administration will inaugurate a national food and fiber policy for expanded use of our agricultural abundance. we will no longer view food stockpiles with alarm but will use them as powerful instruments for peace and plenty. we will increase consumption at home. a vigorous, expanding economy will enable many american families to eat more and better food. we will use the food stamp programs authorized to feed needy children, the aged and the unemployed. we will expand and improve the school lunch and milk programs. we will establish and maintain food reserves for national defense purposes near important population centers in order to preserve lives in event of national disaster, and will operate them so as not to depress farm prices. we will expand research into new industrial uses of agricultural products. we will increase consumption abroad. the democratic party believes our nation's capacity to produce food and fiber is one of the great weapons for waging war against hunger and want throughout the world. with wise management of our food abundance we will expand trade between nations, support economic and human development programs, and combat famine. unimaginative, outmoded republican policies which fail to use these productive capacities of our farms have been immensely costly to our nation. they can and will be changed. achieving income parity while farmers have raised their productive efficiency to record levels, republican farm policies have forced their income to drop by percent. tens of thousands of farm families have been bankrupted and forced off the land. this has happened despite the fact that the secretary of agriculture has spent more on farm programs than all previous secretaries in history combined. farmers acting individually or in small groups are helpless to protect their incomes from sharp declines. their only recourse is to produce more, throwing production still further out of balance with demand and driving prices down further. this disastrous downward cycle can be stopped only by effective farm programs sympathetically administered with the assistance of demo elected farmer committees. the democratic administration will work to bring about full parity income for farmers in all segments of agriculture by helping them to balance farm production with the expanding needs of the nation and the world. measures to this end include production and marketing quotas measured in terms of barrels, bushels and bales, loans on basic commodities at not less than percent of parity, production payments, commodity purchases, and marketing orders and agreements. we repudiate the republican administration of the soil bank program, which has emphasized the retirement of whole farm units, and we pledge an orderly land retirement and conservation program. we are convinced that a successful combination of these approaches will cost considerably less than present republican programs which have failed. we will encourage agricultural cooperatives by expanding and liberalizing existing credit facilities and developing new facilities if necessary to assist them in extending their marketing and purchasing activities, and we will protect cooperatives from punitive taxation. the democratic administration will improve the marketing practices of the family-type dairy farm to reduce risk of loss. to protect farmers' incomes in times of natural disaster, the federal crop insurance program, created and developed experimentally under democratic administrations, should be invigorated and expanded nationwide. improving working and living on farms garm families have been among those victimized most severely by republican tight-money policies. young people have been barred from entering agriculture. giant corporations and other non-farmers, with readier access to credit and through vertical integration methods, have supplanted hundreds of farm families and caused the bankruptcy of many others. the democratic party is committed by tradition and conviction to preservation of family agriculture. to this end, we will expand and liberalize farm credit facilities, especially to meet the needs of family farm agriculture and to assist beginning farmers. many families in america's rural counties are still living in poverty because of inadequate resources and opportunity. this blight and personal desperation should have received national priority attention long ago. the new democratic administration will begin at once to eradicate long neglected rural blight. we will help people help themselves with extended and supervised credit for farm improvement, local industrial development, improved vocational training and other assistance to those wishing to change to non farm employment, and with the fullest development of commercial and recreational possibilities. this is one of the major objectives of the area redevelopment program, twice vetoed by the republican president. the rural electric cooperatives celebrate this year the twenty-fifth anniversary of the creation of the rural electrification administration under president franklin d. roosevelt. the democratic congress has successfully fought the efforts of the republican administration to cut off rea loans and force high interest rate policies on this great rural enterprise. we will maintain interest rates for rea co-ops and public power districts at the levels provided in present law. we deplore the administration's failure to provide the dynamic leadership necessary for encouraging loans to rural users for generation of power where necessary. we promise the co-ops active support in meeting the ever growing demand for electric power and telephone service, to be filled on a complete area coverage basis without requiring benefits for special interest power groups. in every way we will seek to help the men, women, and children whose livelihood comes from the soil to achieve better housing, education, health, and decent earnings and working conditions. all these goals demand the leadership of a secretary of agriculture who is conversant with the technological and economic aspects of farm problems, and who is sympathetic with the objectives of effective farm legislation not only for farmers but for the best interest of the nation as a whole. small business . ""the right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home and abroad."" the new democratic administration will act to make our free economy really free, free from the oppression of monopolistic power, and free from the suffocating impact of high interest rates. we will help create an economy in which small businesses can take root, grow and flourish. we democrats pledge: . action to aid small business in obtaining credit and equity capital at reasonable rates. small business which must borrow to stay alive has been a particular victim of the high interest policies of the republican administration. the loan program of the small business administration should be accelerated, and the independence of that agency preserved. the small business investment act of must be administered with a greater sense of its importance and possibilities. . protection of the public against the growth of monopoly. the last seven and one-half years of republican government has been the greatest period of merger and amalgamation in industry and banking in american history. democratic congresses have enacted numerous important measures to strengthen our anti trust laws. since the four democratic congresses have enacted laws like the celler-kefauver anti-merger act, and improved the laws against price discriminations and tie in sales. when the republicans were in control of the 80th and 83rd congresses they failed to enact a single measure to strengthen or improve the anti-trust laws. the democratic party opposes this trend to monopoly. we pledge vigorous enforcement of the anti-trust laws. we favor requiring corporations to file advance notice of mergers with the anti-trust enforcement agencies. we favor permitting all firms to have access at reasonable rates to patented inventions resulting from government financed research and development contracts. we favor strengthening the robinson-patman act to protect small business against price discrimination. we favor authorizing the federal trade commission to obtain temporary injunctions during the pendency of administrative proceedings. . a more equitable share of government contracts to small and independent business. we will move from almost complete reliance on negotiation in the award of government contracts toward open, competitive bidding. housing . ""the right of every family to a decent home."" today our rate of home building is less than that of ten years ago. a healthy, expanding economy will enable us to build two million homes a year, in wholesome neighborhoods, for people of all incomes. at this rate, within a single decade we can clear away our slums and assure every american family a decent place to live. republican policies have led to a decline of the home building industry and the production of fewer homes. republican high-interest policies have forced the cost of decent housing beyond the range of many families. republican indifference has perpetuated slums. we record the unpleasant fact that in at least million americans live in substandard housing. one million new families are formed each year and need housing, and , existing homes are lost through demolition or other causes and need to be replaced. at present, construction does not even meet these requirements, much less permit reduction of the backlog of slum units. we support a housing construction goal of more than two million homes a year. most of the increased construction will be priced to meet the housing needs of middle-income and low-income families who now live in substandard housing and are priced out of the market for decent homes. our housing programs will provide for rental as well as sales housing. they will permit expanded cooperative housing programs and sharply stepped up rehabilitation of existing homes. to make possible the building of two million homes a year in wholesome neighborhoods, the home building industry should be aided by special mortgage assistance, with low interest rates, long-term mortgage periods and reduced down payments. where necessary, direct government loans should be provided. even with this new and flexible approach, there will still be need for a substantial low-rent public housing program authorizing as many units as local communities require and are prepared to build. health . ""the right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health."" illness is expensive. many americans have neither incomes nor insurance protection to enable them to pay for modern health care. the problem is particularly acute with our older citizens, among whom serious illness strikes most often. we shall provide medical care benefits for the aged as part of the time-tested social security insurance system. we reject any proposal which would require such citizens to submit to the indignity of a means test, a ""pauper's oath"". for young and old alike, we need more medical schools, more hospitals, more research laboratories to speed the final conquest of major killers. medical care for older persons fifty million americans, more than a fourth of our people, have no insurance protection against the high cost of illness. for the rest, private health insurance pays, on the average, only about one-third of the cost of medical care. the problem is particularly acute among the million americans over years old, and among disabled workers, widows and orphans. most of these have low-incomes and the elderly among them suffer two to three times as much illness as the rest of the population. the republican administration refused to acknowledge any national responsibility for health care for elder citizens until forced to do so by an increasingly outraged demand. then, its belated proposal was a cynical sham built around a degrading test based on means or income, a ""pauper's oath"". the most practicable way to provide health protection for older people is to use the contributory machinery of the social security system for insurance covering hospital bills and other high-cost medical services. for those relatively few of our older people who have never been eligible for social security coverage we shall provide corresponding benefits by appropriations from the general revenue. research we will step up medical research on the major killers and crippling diseases, cancer, heart disease, arthritis, mental illness. expenditures for these purposes should be limited only by the availability of personnel and promising lines of research. today such illness costs us billion dollars annually, much of which could be avoided. federal appropriations for medical research are barely one percent of this amount. heart disease and cancer together account for two out of every three deaths in this country. the democratic president will summon to a white house conference the nation's most distinguished scientists in these fields to map a coordinated long run program for the prevention and control of these diseases. we will also support a cooperative program with other nations on international health research. hospitals we will expand and improve the hill-burton hospital construction program. health manpower to ease the growing shortage of doctors and other medical personnel we propose federal aid for constructing, expanding and modernizing schools of medicine, dentistry, nursing and public health. we are deeply concerned that the high cost of medical education is putting this profession beyond the means of most american families. we will provide scholarships and other assistance to break through the financial barriers to medical education. mental health mental patients fill more than half the hospital beds in the country today. we will provide greatly increased federal support for psychiatric research and training, and community mental health programs, to help bring back thousands of our hospitalized mentally ill to full and useful lives in the community. . ""the right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accidents, and unemployment."" a program for the aging the democratic administration will end the neglect of our older citizens. they deserve lives of usefulness, dignity, independence, and participation. we shall assure them not only health care but employment for those who want work, decent housing, and recreation. already million americans, about one in ten, are over , with the prospect of million by . health as stated, we will provide an effective system for paid up medical insurance upon retirement financed during working years through the social security mechanism and available to all retired persons without a means test. this has first priority. income half of the people over have incomes inadequate for basic nutrition, decent housing, minimum recreation and medical care. older people who do not want to retire need employment opportunity and those of retirement age who no longer wish to or cannot work need better retirement benefits. we pledge a campaign to eliminate discrimination in employment due to age. as a first step we will prohibit such discrimination by government contractors and subcontractors. we will amend the social security act to increase the retirement benefit for each additional year of work after , thus encouraging workers to continue on the job full time. to encourage part time work by others, we favor raising the dollar-a-year ceiling on what a worker may earn while still drawing social security benefits. retirement benefits must be increased generally, and minimum benefits raised from dollars a month to dollars. housing we shall provide decent and suitable housing which older persons can afford. specifically we shall move ahead with the program of direct government loans for housing for older people initiated in the housing act of , a program which the republican administration has sought to kill. special services we shall take federal action in support of state efforts to bring standards of care in nursing homes and other institutions for the aged up to desirable minimums. we shall support demonstration and training programs to translate proven research into action in such fields as health, nutritional guidance, home care, counseling, recreational activity. taken together, these measures will affirm a new charter of rights for the older citizens among us, the right to a life of usefulness, health, dignity, independence and participation. welfare disability insurance we shall permit workers who are totally and permanently disabled to retire at any age, removing the arbitrary requirement that the worker be years of age. we shall also amend the law so that after six months of total disability, a worker will be eligible for disability benefits, with restorative services to enable him to return to work. physically handicapped we pledge continued support of legislation for the rehabilitation of physically handicapped persons and improvement of employment opportunity for them. public assistance persons in need who are inadequately protected by social insurance are cared for by the states and local communities under public assistance programs. the federal government, which now shares the cost of aid to some of these, should share in all, and benefits should be made available without regard to residence. unemployment benefits we will establish uniform minimum standards throughout the nation for coverage, duration, and amount of unemployment insurance benefits. equality for women we support legislation which will guarantee to women equality of rights under the law, including equal pay for equal work. child welfare the child welfare program and other services already established under the social security act should be expanded. federal leadership is required in the nationwide campaign to prevent and control juvenile delinquency. intergroup relations we propose a federal bureau of intergroup relations to help solve problems of discrimination in housing, education, employment, and community opportunities in general. the bureau would assist in the solution of problems arising from the resettlement of immigrants and migrants within our own country, and in resolving religious, social and other tensions where they arise. education . ""the right to a good education."" america's young people are our greatest resource for the future. each of them deserves the education which will best develop his potentialities. we shall act at once to help in building the classrooms and employing the teachers that are essential if the right to a good education is to have genuine meaning for all the youth of america in the decade ahead. as a national investment in our future we propose a program of loans and scholarship grants to assure that qualified young americans will have full opportunity for higher education, at the institutions of their choice, regardless of the income of their parents. the new democratic administration will end eight years of official neglect of our educational system. america's education faces a financial crisis. the tremendous increase in the number of children of school and college age has far outrun the available supply of educational facilities and qualified teachers. the classroom shortage alone is interfering with the education of ten million students. america's teachers, parents and school administrators have striven courageously to keep up with the increased challenge of education. so have states and local communities. education absorbs two fifths of all their revenue. with limited resources, private educational institutions have shouldered their share of the burden. only the federal government is not doing its part. for eight years, measures for the relief of the educational crisis have been held up by the cynical maneuvers of the republican party in congress and the white house. we believe that america can meet its educational obligations only with generous federal financial support, within the traditional framework of local control. the assistance will take the form of federal grants to states for educational purposes they deem most pressing including classroom construction and teachers salaries. it will include aid for the construction of academic facilities as well as dormitories at colleges and universities. we pledge further federal support for all phases of vocational education for youth and adults, for libraries and adult education for realizing the potential of educational television, and for exchange of students and teachers with other nations. as part of a broader concern for young people we recommend establishment of a youth conservation corps, to give underprivileged young people a rewarding experience in a healthful environment. the pledges contained in this economic bill of rights point the way to a better life for every family in america. they are the means to a goal that is now within our reach, the final eradication in america of the age-old evil of poverty. yet there are other pressing needs on our national agenda. natural resources a thin layer of earth, a few inches of rain, and a blanket of air make human life possible on our planet. sound public policy must assure that these essential resources will be available to provide the good life for our children and future generations. water, timber and grazing lands, recreational areas in our parks, shores, forests and wildernesses, energy, minerals, even pure air, all are feeling the press of enormously increased demands of a rapidly growing population. natural resources are the birthright of all the people. the new democratic administration, with the vision that built a tva and a grand coulee, will develop and conserve that heritage for the use of this and future generations. we will reverse republican policies under which america's resources have been wasted depleted underdeveloped and recklessly given away. we favor the best use of our natural resources, which generally means adoption of the multiple purpose principle to achieve full development for all the many functions they can serve. water and soil an abundant supply of pure water is essential to our economy. this is a national problem. water must serve domestic, industrial and irrigation needs and inland navigation. it must provide habitat for fish and wildlife, supply the base for much outdoor recreation, and generate electricity. water must also be controlled to prevent floods, pollution, salinity and silt. the new democratic administration will develop a comprehensive national water resource policy. in cooperation with state and local governments, and interested private groups, the democratic administration will will develop a balanced, multiple purpose plan for each major river basin, to be revised periodically to meet changing needs. we will erase the republican slogan of ""no new starts"" and will begin again to build multiple purpose dams, hydroelectric facilities, flood-control works, navigation facilities, and reclamation projects to meet mounting and urgent needs. we will renew the drive to protect every acre of farm land under a soil and water conservation plan, and we will speed up the small watershed program. we will support and intensify the research effort to find an economical way to convert salt and brackish water. the republicans discouraged this research, which holds untold possibilities for the whole world. water and air pollution america can no longer take pure water and air for granted. polluted rivers carry their dangers to everyone living along their courses, impure air does not respect boundaries. federal action is needed in planning, coordinating and helping to finance pollution control. the states and local communities cannot go it alone. yet president eisenhower vetoed a democratic bill to give them more financial help in building sewage treatment plants. a democratic president will sign such a bill. democrats will step up research on pollution control giving special attention to: . the rapidly growing problem of air pollution from industrial plants, automobile exhausts, and other sources, and . disposal of chemical and radioactive wastes, some of which are now being dumped off our coasts without adequate knowledge of the potential consequences. outdoor recreation as population grows and the work week shortens and transportation becomes easier and speedier, the need for outdoor recreation facilities mounts. we must act quickly to retain public access to the oceans gulfs rivers streams lakes and reservoirs areas while there is yet time. areas near major population centers are and their shorelines, and to reserve adequate camping and recreational particularly needed. the new democratic administration will work to improve and extend recreation opportunities in national parks and monuments, forests, and river development projects, and near metropolitan areas. emphasis will be on attractive low-cost facilities for all the people and on preventing undue commercialization. the national park system is still incomplete, in particular, the few remaining suitable shorelines must be included in it. a national wilderness system should be created for areas already set aside as wildernesses. the system should be extended but only after careful consideration by the congress of the value of areas for competing uses. recreational needs of the surrounding area should be given important consideration in disposing of federally owned lands. we will protect fish and game habitats from commercial exploitation and require military installations to conform to sound conservation practices. energy the republican administration would turn the clock back to the days before the new deal, in an effort to divert the benefits of the great natural energy resources from all the people to a favored few. it has followed for many years a ""no new starts"" policy. it has stalled atomic energy development, it has sought to cripple rural electrification. it has closed the pilot plant on getting oil from shale. it has harrassed and hampered the tva. we reject this philosophy and these policies. the people are entitled to use profitably what they already own. the democratic administration instead will foster the development of efficient regional giant power systems from all sources, including water, tidal, and nuclear power, to supply low cost electricity to all retail electric systems, public, private, and cooperative. the democratic administration will continue to develop ""yardsticks"" for measuring the rates of private utility systems. this means meeting the needs of rural electric cooperatives for low interest loans for distribution, transmission and generation facilities, federal transmission facilities, where appropriate, to provide efficient low-cost power supply, and strict enforcement of the public preference clauses in power marketing. the democratic administration will support continued study and research on energy fuel resources, including new sources in wind and sun. it will push forward with the passamaquoddy tidal power project with its great promise of cheaper power and expanded prosperity for the people of new england. we support the establishment of a national fuels policy. the billion dollar national investment in atomic energy should be protected as a part of the public domain. federal lands and forests the record of the republican administration in handling the public domain is one of complete lethargy. it has failed to secure existing assets. in some cases, it has given away priceless resources for plunder by private corporations, as in the al sarena mining incident and the secret leasing of game refuges to favored oil interests. the new democratic administration will develop balanced land and forest policies suited to the needs of a growing america. this means intensive forest management in a multiple-use and sustained-yield basis, reforestation of burnt-over lands, building public access roads, range reseeding and improvement, intensive work in watershed management, concern for small business operations, and insuring free public access to public lands for recreational uses. minerals america uses half the minerals produced in the entire free world. yet our mining industry is in what may be the initial phase of a serious long-term depression. sound policy requires that we strengthen the domestic mining industry without interfering with adequate supplies of needed materials at reasonable costs. we pledge immediate efforts toward the establishment of a realistic long-range minerals policy. the new democratic administration will begin intensive research on scientific prospecting for mineral deposits. we will speed up the geologic mapping of the country, with emphasis on alaska. we will resume research and development work on use of low grade mineral reserves, especially oil shale, lignites, iron ore taconite, and radio-active minerals. these efforts have been halted or cut back by the republican administration. the democratic party favors a study of the problem of non uniform seaward boundaries of the costal states. government machinery for managing resources long-range programming of the nation's resource development is essential. we favor creation of a council of advisors on resources and conservation, which will evaluate and report annually upon our resource needs and progress. we shall put budgeting for resources on a businesslike basis, distinguishing between operating expense and capital investment, so that the country can have an accurate picture of the costs and returns. we propose the incremental method in determining the economic justification of our river basin programs. charges for commercial use of public lands will be brought into line with benefits received. cities and their suburbs a new democratic administration will expand federal programs to help urban communities clear their slums, dispose of their sewage, educate their children, transport suburban commuters to and from their jobs, and combat juvenile delinquency. we will give the city dweller a voice at the cabinet table by bringing together within a single department programs concerned with urban and metropolitan problems. the united states is now predominantly an urban nation. the efficiency, comfort, and beauty of our cities and suburbs influence the lives of all americans. local governments have found increasing difficulty in coping with such fundamental public problems as urban renewal, slum clearance, water supply, mass transportation recreation, health, welfare, education and metropolitan planning. these problems are, in many cases, interstate and regional in scope. yet the republican administration has turned its back on urban and suburban america. the list of republican vetoes includes housing, urban renewal and slum clearance, area redevelopment, public works, airports and steam pollution control. it has proposed severe cutbacks in aid for hospital construction, public assistance, vocational education, community facilities and sewage disposal. the result has been to force communities to thrust an ever greater tax load upon the already overburdened property taxpayer and to forgo needed public services. the democratic party believes that state and local governments are strengthened, not weakened by financial assistance from the federal government. we will extend such aid without impairing local administration through unnecessary federal interference or red tape. we propose a ten year action program to restore our cities and provide for balanced suburban development, including the following: . the elimination of slums and blight and the restoration of cities and depressed areas within the next ten years. . federal aid for metropolitan area planning and community facility programs. . federal aid for comprehensive metropolitan transportation programs, including bus and rail mass transit, commuter railroads as well as highway programs, and construction of civil airports. . federal aid in combating air and water pollution. . expansion of park systems to meet the recreation needs of our growing population. the federal government must recognize the financial burdens placed on local governments, urban and rural alike, by federal installations and land holdings. transportation over the past seven years, we have watched the steady weakening of the nation's transportation system. railroads are in distress. highways are congested. airports and airways lag far behind the needs of the jet age. to meet this challenge we will establish a national transportation policy, designed to coordinate and modernize our facilities for transportation by road, rail, water, and air. air the jet age has made rapid improvement in air safety imperative. rather than ""an orderly withdrawal"" from the airport grant programs as proposed by the republican administration, we pledge to expand the program to accommodate growing air traffic. water development of our inland waterways, our harbors, and great lakes commerce has been held back by the republican president. we pledge the improvement of our rivers and harbors by new starts and adequate maintenance. a strong and efficient american-flag merchant marine is essential to peacetime commerce and defense emergencies. continued aid for ship construction and operation to offset cost differentials favoring foreign shipping is essential to these goals. roads the republican administration has slowed down, stretched out and greatly increased the costs of the interstate highway program. the democratic party supports the highway program embodied in the acts of and and the principle of federal-state partnership in highway construction. we commend the democratic congress for establishing a special committee which has launched an extensive investigation of this highway program. continued scrutiny of this multi-billion-dollar highway program can prevent waste, inefficiency and graft and maintain the public's confidence. rail the nation's railroads are in particular need of freedom from burdensome regulation to enable them to compete effectively with other forms of transportation. we also support federal assistance in meeting certain capital needs, particularly for urban mass transportation. science we will recognize the special role of our federal government in support of basic and applied research. space the republican administration has remained incredibly blind to the prospects of space exploration. it has failed to pursue space programs with a sense of urgency at all close to their importance to the future of the world. it has allowed the communists to hit the moon first, and to launch substantially greater payloads. the republican program is a catchall of assorted projects with no clearly defined, long range plan of research. the new democratic administration will press forward with our national space program in full realization of the importance of space accomplishments to our national security and our international prestige. we shall reorganize the program to achieve both efficiency and speedy execution. we shall bring top scientists into positions of responsibility. we shall undertake long-term basic research in space science and propulsion. we shall initiate negotiations leading toward the international regulation of space. atomic energy the united states became pre-eminent in the development of atomic energy under democratic administrations. the republican administration, despite its glowing promises of ""atoms for peace"" has permitted the gradual deterioration of united states leadership in atomic development both at home and abroad. in order to restore united states leadership in atomic development, the new democratic administration will: . restore truly nonpartisan and vigorous administration of the vital atomic energy program. . continue the development of the various promising experimental and prototype atomic power plants which show promise, and provide increasing support for longer-range projects at the frontiers of atomic energy application. . continue to preserve and support national laboratories and other federal atomic installations as the foundation of technical progress and a bulwark of national defense. . accelerate the rover nuclear rocket project and auxiliary power facilities so as to achieve world leadership in peaceful outer space exploration. . give reality to the united states international atoms-for peace programs and continue and expand technological assistance to underdeveloped countries. . consider measures for improved organization and procedure for radiation protection and reactor safety, including a strengthening of the role of the federal radiation council, and the separation of quasi-judicial functions in reactor safety regulations. . provide a balanced and flexible nuclear defense capability, including the augmentation of the nuclear submarine fleet. oceanography oceanographic research is needed to advance such important programs as food and minerals from our great lakes and the sea. the present administration has neglected this new scientific frontier. government operations we shall reform the processes of government in all branches, executive, legislative, and judicial. we will clean out corruption and conflicts of interest, and improve government services. the federal service two weeks before this platform was adopted, the difference between the democratic and republican attitudes toward government employees was dramatically illustrated. the democratic congress passed a fully justified pay increase to bring government pay scales more nearly into line with those of private industry. the republican president vetoed the pay raise. the democratic congress decisively overrode the veto. the heavy responsibilities of modern government require a federal service characterized by devotion to duty, honesty of purpose and highest competence. we pledge the modernization and strengthening of our civil service system. we shall extend and improve the employees appeals system and improve programs for recognizing the outstanding merits of individual employees. ethics in government we reject totally the concept of dual or triple loyalty on the part of federal officials in high places. the conflict-of-interest statutes should be revised and strengthened to assure the federal service of maximum security against unethical practices on the part of public officials. the democratic administration will establish and enforce a code of ethics to maintain the full dignity and integrity of the federal service and to make it more attractive to the ablest men and women. regulatory agencies the democratic party promises to clean up the federal regulatory agencies. the acceptance by republican appointees to these agencies of gifts, hospitality, and bribes from interests under their jurisdiction has been a particularly flagrant abuse of public trust. we shall bring all contacts with commissioners into the open, and will protect them from any form of improper pressure. we shall appoint to these agencies men of ability and independent judgment who understand that their function is to regulate these industries in the public interest. we promise a thorough review of existing agency practices, with an eye toward speedier decisions, and a clearer definition of what constitutes the public interest. the democratic party condemns the usurpation by the executive of the powers and functions of any of the independent agencies and pledges the restoration of the independence of such agencies and the protection of their integrity of action. the postal service the republican policy has been to treat the united states postal service as a liability instead of a great investment in national enlightenment, social efficiency and economic betterment. constant curtailment of service has inconvenienced every citizen. a program must be undertaken to establish the post office department as a model of efficiency and service. we pledge ourselves to: . restore the principle that the postal service is a public service. . separate the public service costs from those to be borne by the users of the mails. . continue steady improvement in working conditions and wage scales, reflecting increasing productivity. . establish a long range program for research and capital improvements compatible with the highest standards of business efficiency. law enforcement in recent years, we have been faced with a shocking increase in crimes of all kinds. organized criminals have even infiltrated into legitimate business enterprises and labor unions. the republican administration, particularly the attorney general's office, has failed lamentably to deal with this problem despite the growing power of the underworld. the new democratic administration will take vigorous corrective action. freedom of information we reject the republican contention that the workings of government are the special private preserve of the executive. the massive wall of secrecy erected between the executive branch and the congress as well as the citizen must be torn down. information must flow freely, save in those areas in which the national security is involved. clean elections the democratic party favors realistic and effective limitations on contributions and expenditures, and full disclosure of campaign financing in federal elections. we further propose a tax credit to encourage small contributions to political parties. the democratic party affirms that every candidate for public office has a moral obligation to observe and uphold traditional american principles of decency, honesty and fair play in his campaign for election. we deplore efforts to divide the united states into regional and ethnic groups. we denounce and repudiate campaign tactics that substitute smear and slander, bigotry and false accusations of bigotry, for truth and reasoned argument. district of columbia the capital city of our nation should be a symbol of democracy to people throughout the world. the democratic party reaffirms its long-standing support of home rule for the district of columbia, and pledges to enact legislation permitting voters of the district to elect their own local government. we urge the legislatures of the states to ratify the 23rd amendment passed by the democratic congress to give distict citizens the right to participate in presidential elections. we also support a constitutional amendment giving the district voting representation in congress. virgin islands we believe that the voters of the virgin islands should have the right to elect their own governor, to have a delegate in the congress of the united states and to have the right to vote in national elections for a president and vice president of the united states. puerto rico the social, economic, and political progress of the commonwealth of puerto rico is a testimonial to the sound enabling legislation, and to the sincerity and understanding with which the people of the states and puerto rico are meeting their joint problems. the democratic party, under whose administration the commonwealth status was established, is entitled to great credit for providing the opportunity which the people of puerto rico have used so successfully. puerto rico has become a show place of world-wide interest, a tribute to the benefits of the principles of self-determination. further benefits for puerto rico under these principles are certain to follow. congressional procedures in order that the will of the american people may be expressed upon all legislative proposals, we urge that action be taken at the beginning of the 87th congress to improve congressional procedures so that majority rule prevails and decisions can be made after reasonable debate without being blocked by a minority in either house. the rules of the house of representatives should be so amended as to make sure that bills reported by legislative committees reach the floor for consideration without undue delay. consumers in an age of mass production, distribution, and advertising, consumers require effective government representation and protection. the republican administration has allowed the food and drug administration to be weakened. recent senate hearings on the drug industry have revealed how flagrant profiteering can be when essential facts on costs, prices, and profits are hidden from scrutiny. the new democratic administration will provide the money and the authority to strengthen this agency for its task. we propose a consumer counsel, backed by a suitable staff, to speak for consumers in the formulation of government policies and represent consumers in administrative proceedings. the consumer also has a right to know the cost of credit when he borrows money. we shall enact federal legislation requiring to vendors of credit to provide a statement of specific credit charges and what these charges cost in terms of true annual interest. veterans affairs we adhere to the american tradition dating from the plymouth conony in new england in : ""any soldier injured in defense of the colony shall be maintained competently by the colony for the remainder of his life."" we pledge adequate compensation for those with service connected disabilities and for the survivors of those who died in service or from service-connected disabilities. we pledge pensions adequate for a full and dignified life for disabled and distressed veterans and for needy survivors of deceased veterans. veterans of world war i whose federal benefits have not matched those of veterans of subsequent service, will receive the special attention of the democratic party looking toward equitable adjustments. we endorse expanded programs of vocational rehabilitation for disabled veterans, and education for orphans of servicemen. the quality of medical care furnished to the disabled veterans has deteriorated under the republican administration. we shall work for an increased availability of facilities for all veterans in need and we shall move with particular urgency to fulfull the need for expanded domiciliary and nursing-home facilities. we shall continue the veterans home loan guarantee and direct loan programs and educational benefits patterned after the g.i. bill of rights. american indians we recognize the unique legal and moral responsibility of the federal government for indians in restitution for the injustice that has sometimes been done them. we therefore pledge prompt adoption of a program to assist indian tribes in the full development of their human and natural resources and to advance the health, education, and economic well-being of indian citizens while preserving their cultural heritage. free consent of the indian tribes concerned shall be required before the federal government makes any change in any federal indian treaty or other contractual relationship. the new democratic administration will bring competent, sympathetic, and dedicated leadership to the administration of indian affairs which will end practices that have eroded indian rights and resources, reduced the indians land base and repudiated federal responsibility. indian claims against the united states can and will be settled promptly, whether by negotiation or other means, in the best interests of both parties. the arts the arts flourish where there is freedom and where individual initiative and imagination are encouraged. we enjoy the blessings of such an atmosphere. the nation should begin to evaluate the possibilities for encouraging and expanding participation in and appreciation of our cultural life. we propose a federal advisory agency to assist in the evaluation, development, and expansion of cultural resources of the united-states. we shall support legislation needed to provide incentives for those endowed with extraordinary talent, as a worthy supplement to existing scholarship programs. civil liberties with democratic values threatened today by communist tyranny, we reaffirm our dedication to the bill of rights. freedom and civil liberties, far from being incompatible with security, are vital to our national strength. unfortunately, those high in the republican administration have all too often sullied the name and honor of loyal and faithful american citizens in and out of government. the democratic party will strive to improve congressional investigating and hearing procedures. we shall abolish useless disclaimer affidavits such as those for student educational loans. we shall provide a full and fair hearing, including confrontation of the accuser, to any person whose public or private employment or reputation is jeopardized by a loyalty or security proceeding. protection of rights of american citizens to travel, to pursue lawful trade and to engage in other lawful activities abroad without distinction as to race or religion is a cardinal function of the national sovereignty. we will oppose any international agreement or treaty which by its terms or practices differentiates among american citizens on grounds of race or religion. the list of unfinished business for america is long. the accumulated neglect of nearly a decade cannot be wiped out overnight. many of the objectives which we seek will require our best efforts over a period of years. although the task is far-reaching, we will tackle it with vigor and confidence. we will substitute planning for confusion, purpose for indifference, direction for drift and apathy. we will organize the policymaking machinery of the executive branch to provide vigor and leadership in establishing our national goals and achieving them. the new democratic president will sign, not veto, the efforts of a democratic congress to create more jobs, to build more homes, to save family farms, to clean up polluted streams and rivers, to help depressed areas, and to provide full employment for our people. fiscal responsibility we vigorously reject the notion that america, with a half trillion-dollar gross national product, and nearly half of the world's industrial resources, cannot afford to meet our needs at home and in our world relationships. we believe, moreover, that except in periods of recession or national emergency, these needs can be met with a balanced budget, with no increase in present tax rates, and with some surplus for the gradual reduction of our national debt. to assure such a balance we shall pursue a four-point program of fiscal responsibility. first, we shall end the gross waste in federal expenditures which needlessly raises the budgets of many government agencies. the most conspicuous unnecessary item is, of course, the excessive cost of interest on the national debt. courageous action to end duplication and competition among the armed services will achieve large savings. the cost of the agricultural program can be reduced while at the same time prosperity is being restored to the nation's farmers. second, we shall collect the billions in taxes which are owed to the federal government but not now collected. the internal revenue service is still suffering from the cuts inflicted upon its enforcement staff by the republican administration and the republican congress in . the administration's own commissioner of internal revenue has testified that billions of dollars in revenue are lost each year because of the service does not have sufficient agents to follow up on tax evasion. we will add enforcement personnel, and develop new techniques of enforcement, to collect tax revenue which is now being lost through evasion. third, we shall close the loopholes in the tax laws by which certain privileged groups legally escape their fair share of taxation. among the more conspicuous loopholes are depletion allowances which are inequitable, special consideration for recipients of dividend income, and deductions for extravagant ""business expenses"" which have reached scandalous proportions. tax reform can raise additional revenue and at the same time increase legitimate incentives for growth, and make it possible to ease the burden on the general taxpayer who now pays an unfair share of taxes because of special favors to the few. fourth, we shall bring in added federal tax revenues by expanding the economy itself. each dollar of additional production puts an additional cents in tax revenue in the national treasury. a five percent growth rate, therefore, will mean that at the end of four years the federal government will have had a total of nearly billion dollars in additional tax revenues above those presently received. by these four methods we can sharply increase the government funds available for needed services, for correction of tax inequities, and for debt or tax reduction. much of the challenge of the 1960s, however, remains unforeseen and unforeseeable. if, therefore, the unfolding demands of the new decade at home or abroad should impose clear national responsibilities that cannot be fulfilled without higher taxes, we will not allow political disadvantage to deter us from doing what is required. as we proceed with the urgent task of restoring america's productivity, confidence, and power we will never forget that our national interest is more than the sum total of all the group interests in america. when group interests conflict with the national interest, it will be the national interest which we serve. on its values and goals the quality of american life depends. here above all our national interest and our devotion to the rights of man coincide. democratic administrations under wilson, roosevelt, and truman led the way in pressing for economic justice for all americans. but man does not live by bread alone. a new democratic administration, like its predecessors, will once again look beyond material goals to the spiritual meaning of american society. we have drifted into a national mood that accepts payola and quiz scandals, tax evasion and false expense accounts, soaring crime rates, influence peddling in high government circles, and the exploitation of sadistic violence as popular entertainment. for eight long critical years our present national leadership has made no effective effort to reverse this mood. the new democratic administration will help create a sense of national purpose and higher standards of public behavior. civil rights we shall also seek to create an affirmative new atmosphere in which to deal with racial divisions and inequalities which threaten both the integrity of our democratic faith and the proposition on which our nation was founded, that all men are created equal. it is our faith in human dignity that distinguishes our open free society from the closed totalitarian society of the communists. the constitution of the united states rejects the notion that the rights of man means the rights of some men only. we reject it too. the right to vote is the first principle of self-government. the constitution also guarantees to all americans the equal protection of the laws. it is the duty of the congress to enact the laws necessary and proper to protect and promote these constitutional rights. the supreme court has the power to interpret these rights and the laws thus enacted. it is the duty of the president to see that these rights are respected and that the constitution and laws as interpreted by the supreme court are faithfully executed. what is now required is effective moral and political leadership by the whole executive branch of our government to make equal opportunity a living reality for all americans. as the party of jefferson, we shall provide that leadership. in every city and state in greater or lesser degree there is discrimination based on color, race, religion, or national origin. if discrimination in voting, education, the administration of justice or segregated lunch counters are the issues in one area, discrimination in housing and employment may be pressing questions elsewhere. the peaceful demonstrations for first-class citizenship which have recently taken place in many parts of this country are a signal to all of us to make good at long last the guarantees of our constitution. the time has come to assure equal access for all americans to all areas of community life, including voting booths, schoolrooms, jobs, housing, and public facilities. the democratic administration which takes office next january will therefore use the full powers provided in the civil rights acts of and to secure for all americans the right to vote. if these powers, vigorously invoked by a new attorney general and backed by a strong and imaginative democratic president prove inadequate, further powers will be sought. we will support whatever action is necessary to eliminate literacy tests and the payment of poll taxes as requirements for voting. a new democratic administration will also use its full powers, legal and moral, to ensure the beginning of good faith compliance with the constitutional requirement that racial discrimination be ended in public education. we believe that every school district affected by the supreme court's school desegregation decision should submit a plan providing for at least first step compliance by , the 100th anniversary of the emancipation proclamation. to facilitate compliance, technical and financial assistance should be given to school districts facing special problems of transition. for this and for the protection of all other constitutional rights of americans, the attorney general should be empowered and directed to file civil injunction suits in federal courts to prevent the denial of any civil right on grounds of race, creed, or color. the new democratic administration will support federal legislation establishing a fair employment practices commission to secure effectively for everyone the right of equal opportunity for employment. in the president's committee on civil rights recommended a permanent commission on civil rights. the new democratic administration will broaden the scope and strengthen the powers of the present commission and make it permanent. its functions will be to provide assistance to communities, industries, or individuals in the implementation of constitutional rights in education, housing, employment, transportation, and the administration of justice. in addition, the democratic administration will use its full executive powers to assure equal employment opportunities and to terminate racial segregation throughout federal services and institutions, and on all government contracts. the sucessful desegregation of the armed services took place through such decisive executive action under president truman. similarly the new democratic administration will take action to end discrimination in federal housing programs, including federally assisted housing. to accomplish these goals will require executive orders, legal actions brought by the attorney general, legislation, and improved congressional procedures to safeguard majority rule. above all, it will require the strong, active, persuasive, and inventive leadership of the president of the united states. the democratic president who takes office next january will face unprecedented challenges. his administration will present a new face to the world. it will be a bold, confident, affirmative face. we will draw new strength from the universal truths which the founder of our party asserted in the declaration of independence to be ""self evident"". emerson once spoke of an unending contest in human affairs, a contest between the party of hope and the party of memory. for seven and one-half years america, governed by the party of memory, has taken a holiday from history. as the party of hope it is our responsibility and opportunity to call forth the greatness of the american people. in this spirit, we hereby rededicate ourselves to the continuing service of the rights of man everywhere in america and everywhere else on god's earth.","['america', 'first', 'contested', 'national', 'election', 'party', 'leadership', 'thomas', 'jefferson', 'campaigned', 'principles', 'rights', 'man', 'ever',

Democratic Party,1964,1960,dem_1964.csv,CSV,"ONE NATION, ONE PEOPLE. America is One Nation, One People. The welfare, progress, security and survival of each of us reside in the common good, the sharing of responsibilities as well as benefits by all our people. Democracy in America rests on the confidence that people can be trusted with freedom. It comes from the conviction that we will find in freedom a unity of purpose stronger than all our differences. We have drawn upon that unity when the forces of ignorance, hate, and fear fired an assassin'sbullet at the nation's heart, incited violence in our land, and attacked the outposts of freedom around the world. Because of this unity, those who traffic in fear, hate, falsehood, and violence have failed to undermine our people's deep love of truth and quiet faith in freedom. Our program for the future is to make the national purpose,the human purpose of us all, fulfill our individual needs. Accordingly, we offer this platform as a convenant of unity. We invite all to join us who believe that narrow partisanship takes too small account of the size of our task, the penalties for failure and the boundless rewards to all our people for success. We offer as the goal of this covenant peace for all nations and freedom for all peoples. PEACE Peace should be the first concern of all governments as it is the prayer of all men. At the start of the third decade of the nuclear age, the preservation of peace requires the strength to wage war and the wisdom to avoid it. The search of peace requires the utmost intelligence, the clearest vision, and a strong sense of reality. Because for four years our nation has patiently demonstrated these qualities and persistently used them, the world is closer to peace today than it was in 1960. In 1960, freedom was on the defensive. The Communists, doubting both our strength and our will to use it, pressed forward in Southeast Asia, Latin-America, Central Africa and Berlin. President Kennedy and Vice-President Johnson set out to remove any question of our power or our will. In the Cuban crisis of 1962 the Communist offensive shattered on the rock of President Kennedy's determination, and our ability, to defend the peace. Two years later, President Johnson responded to another Communist challenge, this time in the Gulf of Tonkin. Once again power exercised with restraint repulsed Communist aggression and strengthened the cause of freedom. Responsible leadership, unafraid but refusing to take needless risk, has turned the tide in freedom's favor. No nation, old or new, has joined the Communist bloc since Cuba during the preceding Republican Administration. Battered by economic failures, challenged by recent American achievements in space, torn by the Chinese-Russian rift, and faced with American strength and courage, international Communism has lost its unity and momentum. NATIONAL DEFENSE By the end of 1960, military strategy was being shaped by the dictates of arbitrary budget ceilings instead of the real needs of national security. There were, for example, too few ground and air forces to fight limited war, although such wars were a means to continued Communist expansion. Since then, and at the lowest possible cost, we have created a balanced, versatile, powerful defense establishment, capable of countering aggression across the entire spectrum of conflict, from nuclear confrontation to guerrilla subversion. We have increased our intercontinental ballistic missiles and Polaris missiles from fewer than 100 to more than 1000, more than four times the force of the Soviet Union. We have increased the number of combat ready divisions from 11 to 16. Until such time as there can be an enforceable treaty providing for inspected and verified disarmament, we must, and we will, maintain our military strength, as the sword and shield of freedom and the guarantor of peace. Specifically, we must and we will: Continue the overwhelming supremacy of our Strategic Nuclear Forces. Strengthen further our forces for discouraging limited wars and fighting subversion. Maintain the world's largest research and development effort, which has initiated more than 200 new programs since 1961, to ensure continued American leadership in weapons systems and equipment. Continue the nationwide Civil Defense program as an important part of our national security. Pursue our examination of the Selective Service program to make certain that it is continued only as long as it is necessary and that we meet our military manpower needs without social or economic injustice. Attract to the military services the highest caliber of career men and women and make certain they are adequately paid and adequately housed. Maintain our Cost Reduction Program, to ensure a dollar's worth of defense for every dollar spent, and minimize the disruptive effect of changes in defense spending. BUILDING THE PEACE As citizens of the United States we are determined that it be the most powerful nation on earth. As citizens of the world we insist that this power be exercised with the utmost responsibility. Control of the use of nuclear weapons must remain solely with the highest elected official in the country, the President of the United States. Through our policy of never negotiating from fear but never fearing to negotiate, we are slowly but surely approaching the point where effective international agreements providing for inspection and control can begin to lift the crushing burden of armaments off the backs of the people of the world. In the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, signed now by over 100 nations, we have written our commitment to limitations on the arms race, consistent with our security. Reduced production of nuclear material for weapons purposes has been announded and nuclear weapons have been barred from outer space. Already the air we and our children breathe is freer of nuclear contamination. We are determined to continue all-out efforts through fully enforceable measures to halt and reverse the arms race and bring to an end the era of nuclear terror.  We will maintain our solemn commitment to the United Nations with its constituent agencies working to strengthen it as a more effective instrument for peace, for preventing or resolving international disputes, and for building free nations through economic, technical, and cultural development. We continue to oppose the admission of Red China to the United Nations. Be believe in increased partership with our friends and associates in the community which spans the North Atlantic. In every possible way we will work to strengthen our ties and increase our cooperation, building always more firmly on the sure foundation of the NATO treaty. We pledge unflagging devotion to our commitments to freedom from Berlin to South Vietnam. We will: Help the people of developing nations in Asia, Africa and Latin America raise their standards of living and create conditions in which freedom and independence can flourish. Place increased priority on private enterprise and development loans as we continue to improve our mutual assistance programs. Work for the attainment of peace in the Near East as an urgent goal, using our best efforts to prevent a military unbalance, to encourage arms reductions and the use of national resources for internal development and to encourage the resettlement of Arab refugees in lands where there is room and opportunity. The problems of political adjustment between Israel and the Arab countries can and must be peacefully resolved and the territorial integrity of every nation respected. Support the partnership of free American Republics in the Alliance for Progress.  Move actively to carry out the Resolution of the Organization of American States to further isolate Castroism and speed the restoration of freedom and responsibility in Cuba. Support our friends in and around the rim of the Pacific, and encourage a growing understanding among peoples, expansion of cultural exchanges, and strengthening of ties. Oppose aggression and the use of force or the threat of force against any nation. Encourage by all peaceful means the growing independence of the captive peoples living under Communism and hasten the day that Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Rumania and the other captive nations will achieve full freedom and self-determination. We deplore Communist oppression of Jews and other minorities. Encourage expansion of our economic ties with other nations of the world and eliminate unjustifiable tariff and nontariff barriers, under authority of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Expand the Peace Corps. Use even more of our Food for Peace. THE CONQUEST OF SPACE In four vigorous years we have moved to the forefront of space exploration. The United States must never again settle for second place in the race for tomorrow's frontiers. We will continue the rapid development of space technology for peaceful uses. We will encourage private industry to increase its efforts in space research. We will continue to ensure that any race in space is won for freedom and for peace. THE LEADERSHIP WE OFFER The complications and dangers in our restless, constantly changing world require of us consummate understanding and experience. One rash act, one thoughtless decision, one unchecked reaction and cities could become smouldering ruins and farms parched wasteland. The leadership we offer has already been tested in the crucible of crisis and challenge. To this nation and to all the world we reaffirm President Johnson's resolve to ""use every resource at the command of the government, and the people, to find the road to peace"". We offer this platform as a guide for that journey. FREEDOM AND WELL-BEING There can be full freedom only when all of our people have opportunity for education to the full extent of their ability to learn, followed by the opportunity to employ their learning in the creation of something of value to themselves and to the nation. The Individual Our task is to make the national purpose serve the human purpose: that every person shall have the opportunity to become all that he is capable of becoming. We believe that knowledge is essential to individual freedom and to the conduct of a free society. We believe that knowledge is essential to individual freedom and to the conduct of a free society. we believe that education is the surest and most profitable investment a nation can make. Regardless of family financial status therefore, education should be open to every boy or girl in America up to the highest level which he or she is able to master. In an economy which will offer fewer and fewer places for the unskilled, there must be a wide variety of educational opportunities so that every young American, on leaving school will have acquired the training to take a useful and rewarding place in our society. It is increasingly clear that more of our educational resources must be directed to pre-school training as well as to junior college, college and post-graduate study. The demands on the already inadequate sources of state and local revenues place a serious limitation on education. New methods of financial aid must be explored, including the channeling of federally collected revenues to all levels of education, and, to the extent permitted by the Constitution, to all schools. Only in this way can our educational programs achieve excellence throughout the nation, a goal that must be achieved without interfering with local control and direction of education. In order to insure that all students who can meet the requirements for college entrance can continue their education, we propose an expanded program of public scholarships, guaranteed loans, and work-study grants. We shall develop the potential of the Armed Forces for training young men who might otherwise be rejected for military service because their work skills are underdeveloped. The health of the people is important to the strength and purpose of our country and is a proper part of our common concern. In a nation that lacks neither compassion nor resources, the needless suffering of people who cannot afford adequate medical care is intolerable: We will continue to fight until we have succeeded in including hospital care for older Americans in the Social Security program and have insured adequate assistance to those elderly people suffering from mental illness and mental retardation. We will go forward with research into the causes and cures of disease, accidents, mental illness and mental retardation. We will further expand our health facilities, especially medical schools, hospitals, and research laboratories. America's veterans who served their Nation so well must, in turn, be served fairly by a grateful Nation. First rate hospitals and medical care must be provided veterans with service connected injuries and disabilities, and their compensation rates must insure an adequate standard of living. The National Service Life Insurance Program should be reopened for those who have lost their insurance coverage, and an equitable and just pension system must help meet the need of those disabled veterans and their survivors who require financial assistance. Democracy of Opportunity The variety of our people is the source of our strength and ought not to be a cause of disunity or discord. The rights of all our citizens must be protected and all the laws of our land obeyed if america is to be safe for democracy. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 deserves and requires full observance by every American and fair, effective enforcement if there is any default. Resting upon a national consensus expressed by the overwhelming support of both parties, this new law impairs the rights of no American, it affirms the rights of all Americans. Its purpose is not to divide, but to end division, not to curtail the opportunities of any, but to increase opportunities for all, not to punish, but to promote further our commitment to freedom, the pursuit of justice, and a deeper respect for human dignity. We reaffirm our belief that lawless disregard for the rights of others is wrong, whether used to deny equal rights or to obtain equal rights. We cannot and will not tolerate lawlessness. We can and will seek to eliminate its economic and social causes. True democracy of opportunity will not be served by establishing quotas based on the same false distinctions we seek to erase nor can the effects of prejudice be neutralized by the expedient of preferential practices. The immigration laws must be revised to permit families to be reunited, to welcome the persecuted and oppressed, and to eliminate the discriminatory provisions which base admission upon national origins. We will support legislation to carry forward the progress already made toward full equality of opportunity for women as well as men. We will strive to eliminate discrimination against older Americans, especially in their employment. Ending discrimination based on race, age, sex, or national origin demands not only equal opportunity but the opportunity to be equal. We are concerned not only with people's right to be free, but also with their ability to use their freedom. We will: Carry the War on Poverty forward as a total war against the causes of human want. Move forward with programs to restore those areas, such as Appalachia, which the nation's progress has by-passed. Help the physically handicapped and mentally disadvantaged develop to the full limit of their capabilities. Enhance the security of older Americans by encouraging private retirement and welfare programs, offering opportunities like those provided for the young under the Economic Opportunities Act of 1964, and expanding decent housing which older citizens can afford. Assist our Indian people to improve their standard of living and attain self-sufficiency, the privileges of equal citizenship, and full participation in American life. The Social Security program initiated and developed under the National leadership of the Democratic Party and in the face of ceaseless partisan opposition, contributes greatly to the strength of the Nation. We must insure that those who have contributed to the system shall share in the steady increase in our standard of living by adjusting benefit levels. We hold firmly to the conviction long embraced by Democratic Administrations, that the advancing years of life should bring not fear and loneliness, but security, meaning, and satisfaction. We will encourage further support for the arts, giving people a better chance to use increased leisure and recognizing that the achievements of art are an index of the greatness of a civilization. We will encourage the advance of science and technology for its material rewards, and for its contribution to an understanding of the universe and ourselves. The Economy The Smerican free enterprise system is one of the great achievements of the human mind and spirit. It has developed by a combination of the energetic efforts of working men and women, bold private initiative, the profit motive and wise public policy, until it is now the productive marvel of mankind. In spite of this, at the outset of 1961, America was in the depths of the fourth postwar recession. Since then, in 42 months of uninterrupted expansion under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, we have achieved the longest and strongest peacetime prosperity in modern history: Almost four million jobs have been added to the economy, almost one and one half million since last December. Workers earnings and corporate profits are at the highest level in history. Prices have been more stable than in any other industrial nation in the free world. This did not just happen. It has come about because we have wisely and prudently used our increasing understanding of how the economy works. It is the national purpose, and our commitment, to continue this expansion of the American economy toward its potential, without a recession, with continued stability, and with an extension of the benefits of this growth and prosperity to those who have not fully shared in them. This will require continuation of flexible and innovative fiscal, monetary, and debt management policies, recognizing the importance of low interest rates. We will seek further tax reduction and in the process we need to remove inequities in our present tax laws. In particular we should carefully review all our excise taxes and eliminate those that are obsolete. Consideration should be given to the development of fiscal policies which would provide revenue sources to hard-pressed state and local governments to assist them with their responsibilities. Every penny of Federal spending must be accounted for in terms of the strictest economy, efficiency and integrity. We pledge to continue a frugal government, getting a dollar's value for a dollar spent, and a government worthy of the citizen's confidence. Our goal is a balanced budget in a balanced economy. Our enviable record of price stability must be maintained through sound fiscal and monetary policies and the encouragement of responsible private wage and price policies. Stability is essential to protect our citizens, particularly the retired and handicapped from the ravages of inflation. It is also essential to maintain confidence in the American dollar this confidence has been restored in the past four years through sound policies. Radical changes in technology and automation contribute to increased productivity and a higher standard of living. They must not penalize the few while benefiting the many. We maintain that any man or woman displaced by a machine or by technological change should have the opportunity, without penalty, to another job. Our common responsibility is to see that this right is fulfilled. Full employment is an end in itself and must be insisted upon as a priority objective. It is the national purpose, and our commitment, that every man or woman who is willing and able to work is entitled to a job and to a fair wage for doing it. The coverage of the Fair Labor Standards Act must be extended to all workers employed in industries affecting interstate commerce, and the minimum wage level and coverage increased to assure those at the bottom of the economic scale a fairer share in the benefits of an ever-rising standard of American living. Overtime payment requirements must be increased to assure maximum employment consistent with business efficiency. The matter of the length of work periods should be given continuing consideration. The unemployment insurance program must be basically revised to meet the needs of the unemployed and of the economy, and to assure that this program meets the standards the nation's experience dictates. Agricultural and migratory workers must be given legal protection and economic encouragement. We must develop fully our most precious resource, our manpower. Training and retraining programs must be expanded. A broad-guage manpower program must be developed which will not only satisfy the needs of the economy but will also give work its maximum meaning in the pattern of human life. We will stimulate as well as protect small business, the seed-bed of free enterprise and a major source of employment in our economy. The antitrust laws must be vigorously enforced. Our population, which is growing rapidly and becoming increasingly mobile, and our expanding economy are placing greater demands upon our transportation system than ever before. We must have fast, safe, and economic modes of transportation. Each mode should be encouraged to develop in accordance with its maximum utility, available at the lowest cost under the principles of fair competition. A strong and efficient American Flag merchant marine is essential to peacetime commerce and defense emergencies. The industrial democracy of free private collective bargaining and the security of American trade unions must be strengthened by repealing Section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act. The present inequitable restrictions on the right to organize and to strike and picket peaceably must also be eliminated. In order to protect the hard-earned dollars of American consumers, as well as promote their basic consumer rights, we will make full use of existing authority, and continue to promote efforts on behalf of consumers by industry, voluntary organizations, and state and local governments. Where protection is essential, we will enact legislation to protect the safety of consumers and to provide them with essential information. We will continue to insist that our drugs and medicines are safe and effective, that our food and cosmetics are free from harm, that merchandise is labeled and packaged honestly and that the true cost of credit is disclosed. It is the national purpose, and our commitment to increase the freedom and effectiveness of the essential private forces and processes in the economy. RURAL AMERICA The roots of our economy and our life as a people lie deep in the soil of America's farm land. Our policies and programs must continue to recognize the significant role of agricultural and rural life. To achieve the goals of higher incomes to the farm and ranch, particularly the family-sized farm, lower prices for the consumer, and lower costs to the government, we will continue to carry forward this three-dimensional program. 1. Commodity Programs to strengthen the farm income structure and reach the goal of parity of income in every aspect of American agriculture. We will continue to explore and develop new domestic and foreign markets for the products of our farms and ranches. 2. Consumer Programs including expansion of the Food Stamp Program and the school lunch and other surplus food programs, and acceleration of research into new industrial uses of farm products, in order to assure maximum use of and abundance of wholesome foods at fair prices here and abroad. We will also study new low-cost methods and techniques of food distribution for the benefit of our housewives to better feed their families. 3. Community Programs and agricultural cooperatives to assure rural America decent housing, economic security and full partnership in the building of the great society. We pledge our continued support of the rural telephone program and the Rural Electrification Administration, which are among the great contributions of the Democratic Party to the well-being and comfort of rural America. THE NATION'S NATURAL RESOURCES America's bountiful supply of natural resources has been one of the major factors in achieving our position of world leadership, in developing the greatest industrial machine in the world's history, and in providing a richer and more complete life for every American. But these resources are not inexhaustible. With our vastly expanding population, an estimated 325 million people by the end of the century, there is an ever increasing responsibility to use and conserve our resources wisely and prudently if we are to fulfill our obligation to the trust we hold for future generations. Building on the unsurpassed conservation record of the past four years, we shall: Continue the quickened pace of comprehensive development of river basins in every section of the country, employing multi purpose projects such as flood-control irrigation and reclamation power generation, navigation, municipal water supply, fish and wildlife enhancement and recreation, where appropriate to realize the fullest possible benefits. Provide the people of this nation a balanced outdoor recreation program to add to their health and well-being, including the addition or improved management of national parks, forests, lake shores, seashores and recreation areas. Preserve for us and our posterity through the means provided by the Wilderness Act of 1964 millions of acres of primitive and wilderness areas, including countless beautiful lakes and streams. Increase our stock of wildlife and fish. Continue and strengthen the dynamic program inaugurated to assure fair treatment for american fishermen and the preservation of fishing rights. continue to support balanced land and forest development through intensive forest management on a multiple use and sustained yield basis, reforestation of burned land, providing public access roads, range improvement, watershed management, concern for small business operations and recreational uses. Unlock the resources of the sea through a strong oceanography program. Continue the attack we have launched on the polluted air that envelopes our cities and on eliminating the pollution of our rivers and streams. Intensify our efforts to solve the critical water problems of many sections of this country by desalinization. Sustain and promote strong, vigorous domestic minerals, metals, petroleum and fuels industries. Increase the efficient use of electrical power through regional inter-ties and more extensive use of high voltage transmission. Continue to promote the development of new and improved methods of generating electric power, such as the recent important gains in the field of atomic energy and the Passamaquoddy tidal power project. Preserve the tva which has played such an instrumental role in the revitalization of the area it serves and which has been the inspiration for regional development programs throughout the world. THE CITY The vitality of our cities is essential to the healthy growth of American civilization. In the next 40 years urban populations will double, the area of city land will double and we will have to construct houses, highways and facilities equal to all those built since this country was first settled. Now is the time to redouble our efforts, with full cooperation among local, state and federal governments, for these objectives: The goal of our housing program must be a decent home for every American family.  Special effort must be made in our cities to provide wholesome living for our young people. We must press the fight against narcotics and, through the war against poverty, increase educational and employment opportunities, turning juvenile delinquents into good citizens and tax users into tax payers. We will continue to assist broad community and regional development, urban renewal, mass transit, open space and other programs for our metropolitan areas. We will offer such aid without impairing local Administration through unnecessary Federal interference. Because our cities and suburbs are so important to the welfare of all our people, we believe a department devoted urban affairs should be added to the President's cabinet. THE GOVERNMENT We, the people, are the government. The Democratic Party believes, as Thomas Jefferson first stated that ""the care of human life and happiness is the first and only legitimate object of good government"". The government's business is the people's business. information about public affairs must continue to be freely available to the Congress and to the public. Every person who participates in the government must be held to a standard of ethics which permits no compromise with the principles of absolute honesty and the maintenance of undivided loyalty to the public interest. The Congress of the United States should revise its rules and procedures to assure majority rule after reasonable debate and to guarantee that major legislative proposals of the President can be brought to a vote after reasonable consideration in committee. We support home rule for the District of Columbia. The seat of our government shall be a workshop for democracy, a pilot-plant for freedom, and a place of incomparable beauty. We also support a constitutional amendment giving the District voting representation in Congress and, pending such action, the enactment of legislation providing for a non-voting delegate from District of Columbia to the House of Representatives. We support the right of the people of the Virgin Islands to the fullest measure of self-government, including the right to elect their Governor. The people of Puerto Rico and the people of the United States enjoy a unique relationship that has contributed greatly to the remarkable economic and political development of Puerto Rico. We look forward to the report on that relationship by a commission composed of members from Puerto Rico and the United States and we are confident that it will contribute to the further enhancement of Puerto Rico and the benefit that flows from the principles of self-determination. The Democratic Party holds to the belief that government in the United States local state federal was created in order to serve the people. Each level of government has appropriate powers and each has specific responsibilities. The first responsibility of government at every level is to protect the basic freedoms of the people. No government at any level can properly complain of violation of its power, if it fails to meet its responsibilities. The federal government exists not to grow larger, but to enlarge the individual potential and achievement of the people. The federal government exists not to subordinate the states, but to support them. All of us are Americans. All of us are free men. Ultimately there can be no effective restraint on the powers of government at any level save as Americans exercising their duties as citizens insist upon and maintain free, demo processes of our constitutional system. ONE NATION, ONE PEOPLE On November 22,1963, John Fitzgerald Kennedy was shot down in our land. We honor his memory best and as he would wish by devoting yourselves anew to the larger purposes for which he lived. Of first priority is our renewed commitments to the values and ideals of democracy. We are firmly pledged to continue the nation's march towards the goals of equal opportunity and equal treatment for all Americans regardless of race, creed, color or national origin. We cannot tolerate violence anywhere in our land--north, south, east or west. Resort to lawlessness is anarchy and must be opposed by the Government and all thoughtful citizens. We must expose, wherever it exists, the advocacy of hatred which creates the clear and present danger of violence. We condemn extremism, whether from the right or left, including the extreme tactics of such organizations as the Communist Party, the Ku Klux Klan and the John Birch Society. We know what violence and hate can do. we have seen the tragic consequences of misguided zeal and twisted logic. The time has come now for all of us to understand and respect one another, and to seek the unity of spirit and purpose from which our future greatness will grow, for only as we work together with the object of liberty and justice for all will peace and freedom of each of us be secured. These are the principles which command our cause and strengthen our effort as we cross the new frontier and enter upon the great society.",32946,5269,"one nation, one people. america is one nation, one people. the welfare, progress, security and survival of each of us reside in the common good, the sharing of responsibilities as well as benefits by all our people. democracy in america rests on the confidence that people can be trusted with freedom. it comes from the conviction that we will find in freedom a unity of purpose stronger than all our differences. we have drawn upon that unity when the forces of ignorance, hate, and fear fired an assassin'sbullet at the nation's heart, incited violence in our land, and attacked the outposts of freedom around the world. because of this unity, those who traffic in fear, hate, falsehood, and violence have failed to undermine our people's deep love of truth and quiet faith in freedom. our program for the future is to make the national purpose,the human purpose of us all, fulfill our individual needs. accordingly, we offer this platform as a convenant of unity. we invite all to join us who believe that narrow partisanship takes too

every resource at the command of the government, and the people, to find the road to peace"". we offer this platform as a guide for that journey. freedom and well-being there can be full freedom only when all of our people have opportunity for education to the full extent of their ability to learn, followed by the opportunity to employ their learning in the creation of something of value to themselves and to the nation. the individual our task is to make the national purpose serve the human purpose: that every person shall have the opportunity to become all that he is capable of becoming. we believe that knowledge is essential to individual freedom and to the conduct of a free society. we believe that knowledge is essential to individual freedom and to the conduct of a free society. we believe that education is the surest and most profitable investment a nation can make. regardless of family financial status therefore, education should be open to every boy or girl in america up to the highest level which he or she is able to master. in an economy which will offer fewer and fewer places for the unskilled, there must be a wide variety of educational opportunities so that every young american, on leaving school will have acquired the training to take a useful and rewarding place in our society. it is increasingly clear that more of our educational resources must be directed to pre-school training as well as to junior college, college and post-graduate study. the demands on the already inadequate sources of state and local revenues place a serious limitation on education. new methods of financial aid must be explored, including the channeling of federally collected revenues to all levels of education, and, to the extent permitted by the constitution, to all schools. only in this way can our educational programs achieve excellence throughout the nation, a goal that must be achieved without interfering with local control and direction of education. in order to insure that all students who can meet the requirements for college entrance can continue their education, we propose an expanded program of public scholarships, guaranteed loans, and work-study grants. we shall develop the potential of the armed forces for training young men who might otherwise be rejected for military service because their work skills are underdeveloped. the health of the people is important to the strength and purpose of our country and is a proper part of our common concern. in a nation that lacks neither compassion nor resources, the needless suffering of people who cannot afford adequate medical care is intolerable: we will continue to fight until we have succeeded in including hospital care for older americans in the social security program and have insured adequate assistance to those elderly people suffering from mental illness and mental retardation. we will go forward with research into the causes and cures of disease, accidents, mental illness and mental retardation. we will further expand our health facilities, especially medical schools, hospitals, and research laboratories. america's veterans who served their nation so well must, in turn, be served fairly by a grateful nation. first rate hospitals and medical care must be provided veterans with service connected injuries and disabilities, and their compensation rates must insure an adequate standard of living. the national service life insurance program should be reopened for those who have lost their insurance coverage, and an equitable and just pension system must help meet the need of those disabled veterans and their survivors who require financial assistance. democracy of opportunity the variety of our people is the source of our strength and ought not to be a cause of disunity or discord. the rights of all our citizens must be protected and all the laws of our land obeyed if america is to be safe for democracy. the civil rights act of deserves and requires full observance by every american and fair, effective enforcement if there is any default. resting upon a national consensus expressed by the overwhelming support of both parties, this new law impairs the rights of no american, it affirms the rights of all americans. its purpose is not to divide, but to end division, not to curtail the opportunities of any, but to increase opportunities for all, not to punish, but to promote further our commitment to freedom, the pursuit of justice, and a deeper respect for human dignity. we reaffirm our belief that lawless disregard for the rights of others is wrong, whether used to deny equal rights or to obtain equal rights. we cannot and will not tolerate lawlessness. we can and will seek to eliminate its economic and social causes. true democracy of opportunity will not be served by establishing quotas based on the same false distinctions we seek to erase nor can the effects of prejudice be neutralized by the expedient of preferential practices. the immigration laws must be revised to permit families to be reunited, to welcome the persecuted and oppressed, and to eliminate the discriminatory provisions which base admission upon national origins. we will support legislation to carry forward the progress already made toward full equality of opportunity for women as well as men. we will strive to eliminate discrimination against older americans, especially in their employment. ending discrimination based on race, age, sex, or national origin demands not only equal opportunity but the opportunity to be equal. we are concerned not only with people's right to be free, but also with their ability to use their freedom. we will: carry the war on poverty forward as a total war against the causes of human want. move forward with programs to restore those areas, such as appalachia, which the nation's progress has by-passed. help the physically handicapped and mentally disadvantaged develop to the full limit of their capabilities. enhance the security of older americans by encouraging private retirement and welfare programs, offering opportunities like those provided for the young under the economic opportunities act of , and expanding decent housing which older citizens can afford. assist our indian people to improve their standard of living and attain self-sufficiency, the privileges of equal citizenship, and full participation in american life. the social security program initiated and developed under the national leadership of the democratic party and in the face of ceaseless partisan opposition, contributes greatly to the strength of the nation. we must insure that those who have contributed to the system shall share in the steady increase in our standard of living by adjusting benefit levels. we hold firmly to the conviction long embraced by democratic administrations, that the advancing years of life should bring not fear and loneliness, but security, meaning, and satisfaction. we will encourage further support for the arts, giving people a better chance to use increased leisure and recognizing that the achievements of art are an index of the greatness of a civilization. we will encourage the advance of science and technology for its material rewards, and for its contribution to an understanding of the universe and ourselves. the economy the smerican free enterprise system is one of the great achievements of the human mind and spirit. it has developed by a combination of the energetic efforts of working men and women, bold private initiative, the profit motive and wise public policy, until it is now the productive marvel of mankind. in spite of this, at the outset of , america was in the depths of the fourth postwar recession. since then, in months of uninterrupted expansion under presidents kennedy and johnson, we have achieved the longest and strongest peacetime prosperity in modern history: almost four million jobs have been added to the economy, almost one and one half million since last december. workers earnings and corporate profits are at the highest level in history. prices have been more stable than in any other industrial nation in the free world. this did not just happen. it has come about because we have wisely and prudently used our increasing understanding of how the economy works. it is the national purpose, and our commitment, to continue this expansion of the american economy toward its potential, without a recession, with continued stability, and with an extension of the benefits of this growth and prosperity to those who have not fully shared in them. this will require continuation of flexible and innovative fiscal, monetary, and debt management policies, recognizing the importance of low interest rates. we will seek further tax reduction and in the process we need to remove inequities in our present tax laws. in particular we should carefully review all our excise taxes and eliminate those that are obsolete. consideration should be given to the development of fiscal policies which would provide revenue sources to hard-pressed state and local governments to assist them with their responsibilities. every penny of federal spending must be accounted for in terms of the strictest economy, efficiency and integrity. we pledge to continue a frugal government, getting a dollar's value for a dollar spent, and a government worthy of the citizen's confidence. our goal is a balanced budget in a balanced economy. our enviable record of price stability must be maintained through sound fiscal and monetary policies and the encouragement of responsible private wage and price policies. stability is essential to protect our citizens, particularly the retired and handicapped from the ravages of inflation. it is also essential to maintain confidence in the american dollar this confidence has been restored in the past four years through sound policies. radical changes in technology and automation contribute to increased productivity and a higher standard of living. they must not penalize the few while benefiting the many. we maintain that any man or woman displaced by a machine or by technological change should have the opportunity, without penalty, to another job. our common responsibility is to see that this right is fulfilled. full employment is an end in itself and must be insisted upon as a priority objective. it is the national purpose, and our commitment, that every man or woman who is willing and able to work is entitled to a job and to a fair wage for doing it. the coverage of the fair labor standards act must be extended to all workers employed in industries affecting interstate commerce, and the minimum wage level and coverage increased to assure those at the bottom of the economic scale a fairer share in the benefits of an ever-rising standard of american living. overtime payment requirements must be increased to assure maximum employment consistent with business efficiency. the matter of the length of work periods should be given continuing consideration. the unemployment insurance program must be basically revised to meet the needs of the unemployed and of the economy, and to assure that this program meets the standards the nation's experience dictates. agricultural and migratory workers must be given legal protection and economic encouragement. we must develop fully our most precious resource, our manpower. training and retraining programs must be expanded. a broad-guage manpower program must be developed which will not only satisfy the needs of the economy but will also give work its maximum meaning in the pattern of human life. we will stimulate as well as protect small business, the seed-bed of free enterprise and a major source of employment in our economy. the antitrust laws must be vigorously enforced. our population, which is growing rapidly and becoming increasingly mobile, and our expanding economy are placing greater demands upon our transportation system than ever before. we must have fast, safe, and economic modes of transportation. each mode should be encouraged to develop in accordance with its maximum utility, available at the lowest cost under the principles of fair competition. a strong and efficient american flag merchant marine is essential to peacetime commerce and defense emergencies. the industrial democracy of free private collective bargaining and the security of american trade unions must be strengthened by repealing section (b) of the taft-hartley act. the present inequitable restrictions on the right to organize and to strike and picket peaceably must also be eliminated. in order to protect the hard-earned dollars of american consumers, as well as promote their basic consumer rights, we will make full use of existing authority, and continue to promote efforts on behalf of consumers by industry, voluntary organizations, and state and local governments. where protection is essential, we will enact legislation to protect the safety of consumers and to provide them with essential information. we will continue to insist that our drugs and medicines are safe and effective, that our food and cosmetics are free from harm, that merchandise is labeled and packaged honestly and that the true cost of credit is disclosed. it is the national purpose, and our commitment to increase the freedom and effectiveness of the essential private forces and processes in the economy. rural america the roots of our economy and our life as a people lie deep in the soil of america's farm land. our policies and programs must continue to recognize the significant role of agricultural and rural life. to achieve the goals of higher incomes to the farm and ranch, particularly the family-sized farm, lower prices for the consumer, and lower costs to the government, we will continue to carry forward this three-dimensional program. . commodity programs to strengthen the farm income structure and reach the goal of parity of income in every aspect of american agriculture. we will continue to explore and develop new domestic and foreign markets for the products of our farms and ranches. . consumer programs including expansion of the food stamp program and the school lunch and other surplus food programs, and acceleration of research into new industrial uses of farm products, in order to assure maximum use of and abundance of wholesome foods at fair prices here and abroad. we will also study new low-cost methods and techniques of food distribution for the benefit of our housewives to better feed their families. . community programs and agricultural cooperatives to assure rural america decent housing, economic security and full partnership in the building of the great society. we pledge our continued support of the rural telephone program and the rural electrification administration, which are among the great contributions of the democratic party to the well-being and comfort of rural america. the nation's natural resources america's bountiful supply of natural resources has been one of the major factors in achieving our position of world leadership, in developing the greatest industrial machine in the world's history, and in providing a richer and more complete life for every american. but these resources are not inexhaustible. with our vastly expanding population, an estimated million people by the end of the century, there is an ever increasing responsibility to use and conserve our resources wisely and prudently if we are to fulfill our obligation to the trust we hold for future generations. building on the unsurpassed conservation record of the past four years, we shall: continue the quickened pace of comprehensive development of river basins in every section of the country, employing multi purpose projects such as flood-control irrigation and reclamation power generation, navigation, municipal water supply, fish and wildlife enhancement and recreation, where appropriate to realize the fullest possible benefits. provide the people of this nation a balanced outdoor recreation program to add to their health and well-being, including the addition or improved management of national parks, forests, lake shores, seashores and recreation areas. preserve for us and our posterity through the means provided by the wilderness act of millions of acres of primitive and wilderness areas, including countless beautiful lakes and streams. increase our stock of wildlife and fish. continue and strengthen the dynamic program inaugurated to assure fair treatment for american fishermen and the preservation of fishing rights. continue to support balanced land and forest development through intensive forest management on a multiple use and sustained yield basis, reforestation of burned land, providing public access roads, range improvement, watershed management, concern for small business operations and recreational uses. unlock the resources of the sea through a strong oceanography program. continue the attack we have launched on the polluted air that envelopes our cities and on eliminating the pollution of our rivers and streams. intensify our efforts to solve the critical water problems of many sections of this country by desalinization. sustain and promote strong, vigorous domestic minerals, metals, petroleum and fuels industries. increase the efficient use of electrical power through regional inter-ties and more extensive use of high voltage transmission. continue to promote the development of new and improved methods of generating electric power, such as the recent important gains in the field of atomic energy and the passamaquoddy tidal power project. preserve the tva which has played such an instrumental role in the revitalization of the area it serves and which has been the inspiration for regional development programs throughout the world. the city the vitality of our cities is essential to the healthy growth of american civilization. in the next years urban populations will double, the area of city land will double and we will have to construct houses, highways and facilities equal to all those built since this country was first settled. now is the time to redouble our efforts, with full cooperation among local, state and federal governments, for these objectives: the goal of our housing program must be a decent home for every american family. special effort must be made in our cities to provide wholesome living for our young people. we must press the fight against narcotics and, through the war against poverty, increase educational and employment opportunities, turning juvenile delinquents into good citizens and tax users into tax payers. we will continue to assist broad community and regional development, urban renewal, mass transit, open space and other programs for our metropolitan areas. we will offer such aid without impairing local administration through unnecessary federal interference. because our cities and suburbs are so important to the welfare of all our people, we believe a department devoted urban affairs should be added to the president's cabinet. the government we, the people, are the government. the democratic party believes, as thomas jefferson first stated that ""the care of human life and happiness is the first and only legitimate object of good government"". the government's business is the people's business. information about public affairs must continue to be freely available to the congress and to the public. every person who participates in the government must be held to a standard of ethics which permits no compromise with the principles of absolute honesty and the maintenance of undivided loyalty to the public interest. the congress of the united states should revise its rules and procedures to assure majority rule after reasonable debate and to guarantee that major legislative proposals of the president can be brought to a vote after reasonable consideration in committee. we support home rule for the district of columbia. the seat of our government shall be a workshop for democracy, a pilot-plant for freedom, and a place of incomparable beauty. we also support a constitutional amendment giving the district voting representation in congress and, pending such action, the enactment of legislation providing for a non-voting delegate from district of columbia to the house of representatives. we support the right of the people of the virgin islands to the fullest measure of self-government, including the right to elect their governor. the people of puerto rico and the people of the united states enjoy a unique relationship that has contributed greatly to the remarkable economic and political development of puerto rico. we look forward to the report on that relationship by a commission composed of members from puerto rico and the united states and we are confident that it will contribute to the further enhancement of puerto rico and the benefit that flows from the principles of self-determination. the democratic party holds to the belief that government in the united states local state federal was created in order to serve the people. each level of government has appropriate powers and each has specific responsibilities. the first responsibility of government at every level is to protect the basic freedoms of the people. no government at any level can properly complain of violation of its power, if it fails to meet its responsibilities. the federal government exists not to grow larger, but to enlarge the individual potential and achievement of the people. the federal government exists not to subordinate the states, but to support them. all of us are americans. all of us are free men. ultimately there can be no effective restraint on the powers of government at any level save as americans exercising their duties as citizens insist upon and maintain free, demo processes of our constitutional system. one nation, one people on november ,, john fitzgerald kennedy was shot down in our land. we honor his memory best and as he would wish by devoting yourselves anew to the larger purposes for which he lived. of first priority is our renewed commitments to the values and ideals of democracy. we are firmly pledged to continue the nation's march towards the goals of equal opportunity and equal treatment for all americans regardless of race, creed, color or national origin. we cannot tolerate violence anywhere in our land--north, south, east or west. resort to lawlessness is anarchy and must be opposed by the government and all thoughtful citizens. we must expose, wherever it exists, the advocacy of hatred which creates the clear and present danger of violence. we condemn extremism, whether from the right or left, including the extreme tactics of such organizations as the communist party, the ku klux klan and the john birch society. we know what violence and hate can do. we have seen the tragic consequences of misguided zeal and twisted logic. the time has come now for all of us to understand and respect one another, and to seek the unity of spirit and purpose from which our future greatness will grow, for only as we work together with the object of liberty and justice for all will peace and freedom of each of us be secured. these are the principles which command our cause and strengthen our effort as we cross the new frontier and enter upon the great society.","['one', 'nation', 'one', 'people', 'america', 'one', 'nation', 'one', 'people', 'welfare', 'progress', 'security', 'survival', 'reside', 'common', 'good', 'sharing', 'responsibilities',

Republican Party,1964,1960,rep_1964.csv,CSV,"""FOR THE PEOPLE"" SECTION ONE For a Free People Humanity is tormented once again by an age-old issue, is man to live in dignity and freedom under God or be enslaved, are men in government to serve, or are they to master, their fellow men? It befalls us now to resolve this issue anew, perhaps this time for centuries to come. Nor can we evade the issue here at home. Even in this Constitutional Republic, for two centuries the beacon of liberty the world over, individual freedom retreats under the mounting assault of expanding centralized power. Fiscal and economic excesses, too long indulged, already have eroded and threatened the greatest experiment in self-government mankind has known. We Republicans claim no monopoly of love of freedom. But we challenge as unwise the course the Democrats have charted we challenge as dangerous the steps they plan along the way and we deplore as self-defeating and harmful many of the moves already taken. Dominant in their council are leaders whose words extol human liberty, but whose deeds have persistently delimited the scope of liberty and sapped its vitality. Year after year, in the name of benevolence, these leaders have sought the enlargement of Federal power. Year after year, in the guise of concern for others, they have lavishly expended the resources of their fellow citizens. And year after year freedom, diversity and individual, local and state responsibility have given way to regimentation, conformity and subservience to central power. We Republicans hold that a leadership so misguided weakens liberty in America and the world. We hold that the glittering enticements so invitingly proffered the people, at their own expense will inevitably bring disillusionment and cruel disappointment in place of promised happiness. Such leaders are Federal extremists, impulsive in the use of national power, improvident in the management of public funds, thoughtless as to the long-term effects of their acts on individual freedom and creative, competitive enterprise. Men so recklessly disposed cannot be safely entrusted with authority over their fellow citizens. To Republicans, liberty is still today man's most precious possession. For every citizen, and for the generations to come, we Republicans vow, that it shall be preserved. In substantiation of this belief the Republican Party submits this platform. To the American people it is our solemn bond. To Stay Free The shape of the future is our paramount concern. Much of today's moral decline and drift, much of the prevailing preoccupation with physical and material comforts of life, much of today's crass political appeals to the appetites of the citizenry can be traced to a leadership grown demagogic and materialistic through indifference to national ideals founded in devoutly held religious faith. The Republican Party seeks not to renounce this heritage of faith and high purpose rather, we are determined to reaffirm and reapply it. so doing, these will be our guides: 1. Every person has the right to govern himself, to fix his own goals, and to make his own way with a minimum of governmental interference. 2. It is for government to foster and maintain an environment of freedom encouraging every individual to develop to the fullest his God-given powers of mind, heart and body and, beyond this, government should undertake only needful things, rightly of public concern, which the citizen cannot himself accomplish. We Republicans hold that these two principles must regain their primacy in our government's relations, not only with the American people, but also with nations and peoples everywhere in the world. 3. Within our Republic the Federal Government should act only in areas where it has Constitutional authority to act, and then only in respect to proven needs where individuals and local or state governments will not or cannot adequately perform. Great power, whether governmental or private, political or economic, must be so checked balanced and restrained and where necessary, so dispersed as to prevent it from becoming a threat to freedom any place in the land. 4. It is a high mission of government to help assure equal opportunity for all, affording every citizen an equal chance at the starting line but never determining who is to win or lose. but government must also reflect the nation's compassionate concern for those who are unable, through no fault of their own, to provide adequately for themselves. 5. Government must be restrained in its demands upon and its use of the resources of the people, remembering that it is not the creator but the steward of the wealth it uses that its goals must over discipline its means and that service to all the people, never to selfish or partisan ends, must be the abiding purpose of men entrusted with public power. Deeds Not Words The future we pledge, then, for freedom, by faithful adherence to these guides. Let the people compare these guides with those of the Democratic Party, then test not the words of the two Parties but their performance during the past four years of Democratic control. Let the people ask: Is the Republic stronger today or wiser than when the present Administration took office four years ago? Is its guardianship of freedom more respected at home and throughout the world? For these four years the leaders of the Democratic Party have been entrusted with the nation's executive power and overwhelmingly in control of the Congress. The question must be asked: Have these leaders successfully advanced the purposes of this mightiest nation mankind has known? Tragically, in each instance, the answer must be ""no"". Let the Democratic Party stand accused. SECTION TWO Failures of Foreign Policy This Democratic Administration has been, from its beginning, not the master but the prisoner of major events. The will and dependability of its leadership, even for the defense of the free world, come to be questioned in every area of the globe. DISREGARD OF ALLIES This Administration has neglected to consult with America's allies on critical matters at critical times, leading to lack of confidence, lack of respect and disintergrating alliances. It has permitted an erosion of NATO force and unity, alienating most of its member nations by negotiating with the common foe behind their backs. It has offered concessions to the Communists while according our allies little understanding, patience, or cooperation. This Administration has created discord and distrust by failing to develop a nuclear policy for NATO. It has provoked crises of confidence with our oldest friends, including England and France, by bungling such major projects as Skybolt and NATO's nuclear needs.  It has allowed other great alliances, SEATO and CENTO, also to deteriorate, by failing to provide the leadership required for their revitalization and by neglecting their cooperation in keeping the peace. WEAKNESS BEFORE COMMUNISM This Administration has sought accommodations with Communism without adequate safeguards and compensating gains for freedom. It has alienated proven allies by opening a ""hot line"" first with a sworn enemy rather than with a proven friend, and in general pursued a risky path such as began at Munich a quarter century ago. It has misled the American people and forfeited a priceless opportunity to win concessions for freedom by mishandling sales of farm commodities to communists. At first it disavowed any intent to subsidize prices or use credit later it demanded such authority and forced the Democrats in Congress to acquiesce. At first it hinted at concessions for freedom in return for wheat sold to Russia later it obtained no concessions at all. At first it pledged not to breach retraints on trade with Communist countries in other parts of the world later it stimulated such trade itself, and thus it encouraged trade with Cuba by America's oldest friends. This Administration has collaborated with Indonesian imperialism by helping it to acquire territory belonging to the Netherlands and control over the Papuan people. It has abetted further Communist take-over in Laos, weakly accepted Communist violations of the Geneva Agreement, which the present Administration perpetrated, and increased Soviet influence in Southeast Asia. It has encouraged an increase of aggression in South Vietnam by appearing to set limits on America's willingness to act and then, in the deepening struggle it has sacrificed the lives of American and allied fighting men by denial of modern equipment. This Administration has permitted the shooting down of American pilots, the mistreatment of American citizens, and the destruction of American property to become hallmarks of Communist arrogance. It has stood by as a wire barricade in Berlin became a wall of shame, defacing that great city, humiliating every American, and disgracing free men everywhere.  It has turned its back on the captive peoples of Eastern Europe abandoning their cause in the United Nations and in the official utterances of our government. This Administration has forever blackened our nation's honor at the Bay of Pigs, bungling the invasion plan and leaving brave men on Cuban beaches to be shot down. Later the forsaken survivors were ransomed, and Communism was allowed to march deeper into Latin America. It has turned a deaf ear to pleas from throughout the Western Hemisphere for decisive American leadership to seal off subversion from the Soviet base just off our shore. It has increased the long term troubles for America by retreating from its pledge to obtain on-the-spot proof of the withdrawal of Soviet offensive weapons from Cuba. It left vacant for many critical months the high posts of ambassador in Panama and with the Organization of American States and thus it failed to anticipate and forestall the anti-American violence that burst forth in Panama. UNDERMINING THE UNITED NATIONS This Administration has failed to provide forceful, effective leadership in the United Nations. It has weakened the power and influence of this world organization by failing to demand basic improvements in its procedures and to guard against its becoming merely a forum of anti-Western insult and abuse. It has refused to insist upon enforcement of the United Nations' rules governing financial support though such enforcement is supported by an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice. It has shouldered virtually the full costs of the United Nations' occupation of the Congo, only to have the ousted leadership asked back when United Nations forces had withdrawn. FORSAKING AMERICA'S INTERESTS This Administration has subsidized various forms of socialism throughout the world, to the jeopardy of individual freedom and private enterprise. It has proved itself inept and weak in international trade negotiations, allowing the loss of opportunities historically open to American enterprise and bargaining away markets indispensable to prosperity on American farms. Failure of National Security Planning LOSING A CRITICAL LEAD This Administration has delayed research and development in advanced weapons systems and thus confronted the American people with the fearsome possibility that Soviet advances, in the decade of the nineteen seventies, may surpass America's present lead. Its misuse of ""cost effectiveness"" has stifled the creativity of the nation's military, scientific and industrial communities. It has failed to originate a single new major strategic weapons system after inheriting from a Republican Administration the most powerful military force of all time. It has concealed a lack of qualitative advance for the nineteen seventies by speaking of a quantitative strength which by then will be obsolete. It has not demonstrated the foresight necessary to prepare a strategic strength which in future years will deter war. It has endangered security by downgrading efforts to prepare defenses against enemy ballistic missiles. It has retarded our own military development for near and outer space, while the enemy's development moves on. INVITATIONS TO DISASTER This Administration has adopted policies which will lead to a potentially fatal parity of power with Communism instead of continued military superiority for the United States. It has permitted disarmament negotiations to proceed without adequate consideration of military judgment of procedure which tends to bring about, in effect, a unilateral curtailment of American arms rendered the more dangerous by the Administration's discounting known Soviet's advances in nuclear weaponry. It has failed to take minimum safeguards against possible consequences of the limited nuclear test ban treaty, including advanced underground tests where permissible and full readiness to test elsewhere should the need arise. DISTORTIONS AND BLACKOUTS This Administration has adopted the policies of news management and unjustifiable secrecy, in the guise of guarding the nation's security it has shown a contempt of the right of the people to know the truth. This Administration, while claiming major defense savings, has in fact raised defense spending by billions of dollars a year, and yet has shortchanged critical areas. UNDERMINING MORALE This Administration has weakened the bonds of confidence and understanding between civilian leaders and the nations top military professionals. It has by-passed seasoned military judgment in vital national security policy decisions. It has permitted nonmilitary considerations, political as well as economic, to reverse professional judgment on major weapons and equipment such as the controversial TFX, the X-22, and the nuclear carrier. In sum, both in military and foreign affairs, the Democratic record all the world around is one of disappointment and reverses for freedom. And this record is no better at home. Failures Aa Home INABILITY TO CREATE JOBS This Administration has failed to honor its pledges to assure good jobs, full prosperity and a rapidly growing economy for all the American people: --failing to reduce unemployment to 4 percent falling far short of its announced goal every single month of its tenure in office; and --despite glowing promises, allowing a disheartening increase in long-term and youth unemployment. This Administration has failed to apply Republican-initiated retraining programs where most needed, particularly where they could afford new economic opportunities to Negro citizens. It has preferred instead, divisive political proposals. It has demonstrated its inability to measure up to the challenge of automation which, wisely guided, will enrich the lives of all people. Administration approaches have been negative and unproductive, as for example the proposed penalties upon the use of overtime. Such penalties would serve only to spread existing unemployment and injure those who create jobs. It has failed to perform its responsibility under Republican amendments to the Manpower Training Act. It has neglected, for example, the basic requirement of developing a dictionary of labor skills which are locally, regionally and nationally in short supply, even though many thousands of jobs are unfilled today for lack of qualified applicants. FAILING THE POOR This Administration has refused to take practical free enterprise measures to help the poor. Under the last Republican Administration, the percentage of poor in the country dropped encouragingly from 28 percent to 21 percent. By contrast the present Administration despite a massive increase in the Federal bureaucracy, has managed a mere two percentage point reduction. This Administration has proposed a so-called war on poverty which characteristically overlaps, and often contradicts, the 42 existing Federal poverty programs. It would dangerously centralize Federal controls and by-pass effective state, local and private programs. It has demonstrated little concern for the acute problems created for the poor by inflation. Consumer prices have increased in the past three and a half years by almost 5 percent amounting in effect to a 5 percent national sales tax on the purchases of a family living on fixed income. Under housing and urban renewal programs, notably in the Nation's Capital, it has created new slums by forcing the poor from their homes to make room for luxury apartments, while neglecting the vital need for adequate relocation assistance. RETARDING ENTERPRISES This Administration has violently thrust Federal power into the free market in such areas as steel prices, thus establishing precedents which in future years could critically wound free enterprise in the United States. It has so discouraged private enterprise that the annual increase in the number of businesses has plummeted from the Republican level of 70,000 a year to 47,000 a year. It has allowed the rate of business failures to rise higher under its leadership than in any period since depression days. It has aggravated the problems of small business by multiplying Federal record-keeping requirements and has hurt thousands of small businessmen by forcing up their costs. This Administration has curtailed, through such agencies as the National Labor Relations Board, the simple, basic right of Americans voluntarily to go out of business. It has failed to stimulate new housing and attract more private capital into the field. In the past years it has fallen short by one million five hundred thousand units of meeting its pledge of two million new homes each year. It has sought to weaken the patent system which is so largely responsible for America's progress in technology, medicine and science. It has required private electric power companies to submit to unreasonable Federal controls as a condition to the utilization of rights-of-way over public lands. It has sought to advance, without Congressional authorization, a vastly expensive nationwide electrical transmission grid. BETRAYAL OF THE FARMER This Administration has refused, incredibly, to honor the clear mandate of American wheat farmers, in the largest farm referendum ever held, to free them of rigid Federal controls and to restore their birthright to make their own management decisions. It has strangled the Republican rural development program with red tape and neglected its most essential ingredient, local initiative. It has broken its major promises to farm people, dropping the parity ratio to its lowest level since 1939. It has dumped surplus stocks so as to lower farm income and increase the vicious cost-price squeeze of the farmer. It has evidenced hostility toward American livestock producers by proposals to establish mandatory marketing quotas on livestocks, to fine and imprison dairy farmers failing to maintain Federally acceptable records, and to establish a subsidized grazing cropland conversion program. It has allowed imports of beef and other meat products to rise to an all-time high during a slump in cattle prices which was aggravated by government grain sales. NEGLECT OF NATURAL RESOURCES This Administration has delayed the expeditious handling of oil shale patent applications and the early development of a domestic oil shale industry. It has allowed the deterioration of the domestic mining and petroleum industries including displacement of domestic markets by foreign imports. It has failed to protect the American fishing industry and has retreated from policies providing equitable sharing of internation fishing grounds. FISCAL IRRESPONSIBILITY This Administration has misled the American people by such budget manipulations as crowding spending into the previous fiscal year, presenting a proposal to sell off two and one-third billion dollars in government assets as a cut in spending, and using bookkeeping devices to make expenditures seem smaller than they actually are. It has, despite pledges of economy, burdened this nation with four unbalanced budgets in a row, creating deficits totaling 26 billion dollars, with still more debt to come, reflecting a rate of sustained deficit spending unmatched in peacetime. It has failed to establish sensible priorities for Federal funds. In consequence it has undertaken needlessly expensive crash programs, as for example accelerating a trip to the moon, to the neglect of other critical needs such as research into health and the increasingly serious problems of air and water pollution and urban crowding. This Administration has continued to endanger retirement under Social Security for millions of citizens; it has attempted to overload the System with costly, unrelated programs which ignore the dangers of overly regressive taxation and the unfairness of forcing the poor to finance such programs for the rich. It has demanded the elimination of a substantial portion of personal income tax deductions for charitable and church contributions, for real property taxes paid by home owners, and for interest payments. Elimination of these deductions would impose great hardship upon millions of our citizens and discourage the growth of some of the finest organizations in America. This Administration has impeded investigations of suspected wrongdoing which might implicate public officials in the highest offices in the land. It has thus aroused justifiable resentment against those who use the high road of public service as the low road to illicitly acquired wealth. It has permitted the quality and morale of the postal system to deteriorate and drastically restricted its service. It has made the Post Office almost inaccessible to millions of working people, reduced the once admired Parcel Post System to a national laughing stock, and yet it is intimated that American may soon have to pay eight cents for a first-class postage stamp. It has resisted personal income tax credits for education, always preferring the route leading to Federal control over our schools. Some leading Democrats have even campaigned politically in favor of such tax credits while voting against them in Congress. Contrary to the intent of the Manpower Training Act, it has sought to extend department of labor influence over vocational education. DISCORD AND DISCONTENT This Administration has exploited interracial tensions by extravagant campaign promises, without fulfillment, playing on the just aspirations of the minority groups, encouraging disorderly and lawless elements, and ineffectually administering the laws. It has subjected career civil servants and part-time Federal employees including employees of the Agriculture Department to political pressures harmful to the integrity of the entire Federal service. It has weakened veterans preference in federal jobs. It has made Federal intervention, even on the Presidential level, a standard operating practice in labor disputes, thus menacing the entire system of free collective-bargaining. It has resorted to police state tactics using the great power of Federal Departments and agencies, to compel compliance with Administration desires, notably in the steel price dispute. The Department of Justice, in particular, has been used improperly to achieve partisan political, economic and legislative goals. This abuse of power should be the subject of a Congressional investigation. WEAKENING RESPONSIBILITY This Administration has moved, through such undertakings as its so-called war on poverty, accelerated public works and the New Communities Program in the 1964 housing proposal to establish new Federal offices duplicating existing agencies, by-passing the state capitols, thrusting aside local government, and siphoning off to Washington the administration of private citizen and community affairs. It has undermined the Federally assisted, State-operated medical and hospital assistance program, while using, and abusing, Federal authority to force a compulsory hospital program upon the people and the Congress. This enumeration is necessarily incomplete. It does not exhaust the catalogue of misdeeds and failures of the present Administration. And let the nation realize that the full impact of these many ill-conceived and ill-fated activities of the Democratic administration is yet to come. SECTION THREE The Republican Alternative We Republicans are not content to record Democratic misdeeds and failures. We now offer policies and programs new in conception and dynamic in operation. These we urge to recapture initiative for freedom at home and abroad and to rebuild our strength at home. Nor is this a new role. Republican Presidents from Abraham Lincoln to Dwight D. Eisenhower stand as witness that Republican leadership is steadfast in principle, clear in purpose, and committed to progress. The many achievements of the Eisenhower Administration in strengthening peace abroad and the well-being of all at home have been unmatched in recent times. A new Republican Administration will stand proudly on this record. We do not submit, in this platform, extravagant promises, to be cynically cast aside after election day. Rather, we offer examples of Republican initiatives in areas of overriding concern to the whole nation, North, South, East and West which befit a truly national party. In the interest of brevity we do not repeat the commitments of the 1960 Republican Platform. ""Building a Better America"" and the 1962 ""Declaration of Republican Principle and Policy"". We incorporate into this Platform as pledges renewed those commitments which are relevant to the problems of 1964. These, then, will be our guides, and these our additional pledges in meeting the nation's needs. Faith in the Individual 1. We Republicans shall rely on the individual's rights and capacities to advance his own economic well-being, to control the fruits of his efforts and to plan his own and his family's future and, where government is rightfully involved, we shall assist the individual in surmounting urgent problems beyond his own power and responsibility to control. For instance, we pledge: --enlargement of employment opportunities for urban and rural citizens, with emphasis on training programs to equip them with needed skills improved job information and placement services and research and extension services channeled toward helping rural people improve their own opportunities; --tax credits and other methods of assistance to help needy senior citizens meet the costs of medical and hospital insurance; --a strong, sound system of Social Security, with improved benefits to our people; --continued Federal support for a sound research program aimed at both the prevention and care of diseases and intensified efforts to secure prompt and effective application of the results of research. This will include emphasis on illness drug addiction alcoholism cancer heart disease and other diseases of increasing incidence; --revision of the Social Security laws to allow higher earnings without loss of benefits by our elderly people; --full coverage of all medical and hospital costs of needy elder people financed by general revenues through broader implementation of Federal-State plans, rather than the compulsory Democratic scheme covering only a small percentage of such costs, for everyone regardless of need; --adoption and implementation of a fair and adequate program for providing necessary supplemental farm labor for producing and harvesting agricultural commodities; --tax credits for those burdened by the expenses of college education; --vocational rehabilitation through cooperation between government, Federal and State, and industry, for the mentally and physically handicapped, the chronically unemployed and the poverty stricken; --incentives for employers to hire teen-agers, including broadening of temporary exemptions under the minimum wage law; --to repeal the Administration's wheat-certificate ""bread tax"" on consumers, so burdensome to low-income families and overwhelmingly rejected by farmers --revision of present nonservice-connected pension programs to provide increased benefits for low-income pensioners, with emphasis on rehabilitation nursing homes and World War I veterans; --re-evaluation of the armed forces' manpower procurement programs with the goal of replacing involuntary inductions as soon as possible by an efficient voluntary system offering real career incentives; --enactment of legislation, despite Democratic opposition, to curb the flow through the mails of obscene material which has flourished into a multimillion dollar obscenity racket; --support of a Constitutional amendment permitting those individuals and groups who choose to do so to exercise their religion freely in public places, provided religious exercises are not prepared or prescribed by the state or political subdivision thereof and no person's participation therein is coerced, thus preserving the traditional separation of church and state; --full implementation and faithful execution of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and all other civil rights statutes to assure equal rights and opportunities guaranteed by the Constitution to every citizen --improvements of civil rights statutes adequate to changing needs of our times;  --such additional administrative or legislative actions as may be required to end the denial, for whatever unlawful reason, of the right to vote; --immigration legislation seeking to reunite families and continuation of the ""Fair Share"" Refugee Program; --continued opposition to discrimination based on race, creed, national origin, or sex. We recognize that the elimination of any such discrimination is a matter of heart, conscience, and education as well as of equal rights under the law. In all such programs, where Federal initiative is properly involved, to relieve or prevent misfortune or meet overpowering need, it will be the Republican way to move promptly and energetically whenever possible to provide assistance of a kind enabling the individual to gain or regain the capability to make his own way and to have a fair chance to achieve his own goals. In all matters relating to human rights, it will be the Republican way fully to implement all applicable laws and never to lose sight of the intense need for advancing peaceful progress in human relations in our land. The Party of Abraham Lincoln will proudly and faithfully live up to its heritage of equal rights and equal opportunities for all. In furtherance of our faith in the individual we also pledge prudent, responsible management of the government's fiscal affairs to protect the individual against the evils of spendthrift government protecting most of all the needy and fixed-income families against the cruelest tax, inflation and protecting every citizen against the high taxes forced by excessive spending, in order that each individual may keep more of his earnings for his own and his family's use. For instance we pledge: --a reduction of not less than five billion dollars in the present level of Federal spending; --an end to chronic deficit financing, proudly reaffirming our belief in a balanced budget; --further reduction in individual and corporate tax rates as fiscal discipline is restored; --repayments on the public debt; --maintenance of an administrative, legislative and regulatory climate encouraging job building enterprise to help assure every individual of a real chance for a good job; --wise, firm and responsible conduct of the nation's foreign affairs, backed by military forces kept modern, strong and ready, thereby assuring every individual of a future promising peace. In all such matters it will be the Republican way so to conduct the affairs of government as to give the individual citizen the maximum assurance of a peaceful and prosperous future freed of the discouragement and hardship produced by wasteful and ineffectual government. In furtherance of our faith in the individual, we also pledge the maximum restraint of Federal intrusion into matters more productively left to the individual. For instance, we pledge: --to continue Republican sponsorship of practical Federal State-local programs which will effectively treat the needs of the poor, while resisting direct Federal handouts that erode away, individual self-reliance and self-respect and perpetuate dependency; --to continue the adancement of education on all levels, through such programs as selective aid to higher education, strengthened State and local tax resources, including tax credits for college education, while resisting the Democratic efforts which endanger local control of schools; --to help assure equal opportunity and a good education for all while opposing Federally sponsored ""inverse discrimination"" whether by the shifting of jobs, or the abandonment of neighborhood schools for reasons of race; --to provide our farmers, who have contributed so much to the strength of our nation, with the maximum opportunity to exercise their own management decisions of their own farms, while resisting all efforts to impose upon them further Federal controls; --to establish realistic priorities for the concentration of Federal spending in the most productive and creative areas such as education job training, vocation rehabilitation, educational research, oceanography, and the wise development and use of natural resources in the water as on land, while resisting Democratic efforts to spend wastefully and indiscriminately; --to open avenues of peaceful progress in solving racial controversies while discouraging lawlessness and violence; In all such matters, it will be the Republican way to assure the individual of maximum freedom as government meets its proper responsibility, while resisting the Democratic obsession to impose from above uniform and rigid schemes for meeting varied and complex human problems. Faith in the Competitive System 2. We Republicans shall vigorously protect the dynamo of economic growth, free, competitive enterprise, that has made America the envy of the world. For instance, we pledge: --removal of the wartime Federal excise taxes favored by the Democratic Administration on pens, pencils, jewelry, cosmetics, luggage, handbags, wallets, and toiletries; --assistance to small business by simplifying Federal and state tax and regulatory requirements, fostering the availability of longer term credit at fair terms and equity capital for small firms, encouraging strong State programs to foster small business, establishing more effective measures to assure a sharing of small business in Federal procurement, and promoting wider export opportunities; --an end to power grabbing regulatory actions, such as the reach by the Federal Trade Commission for injunctive powers and the ceaseless pressing by the White House, the Food and Drug Administration and Federal Trade Commission to dominate consumer decisions in the market place; --returning the consumer to the driver's seat as the chief regulator and chief beneficiary of a free economy, by resisting excessive concentration of power, whether public or private; --a drastic reduction in burdensome federal paper work and overlapping regulations which weigh heavily on small business men struggling to compete and to provide jobs; --a determined drive, through tough, realistic negotiations, to remove the many discriminatory and restrictive trade practices of foreign nations; --greater emphasis on overseas sales of surplus farm commodities to friendly countries through long-term credits repayable in dollars under the Republican Food for Peace Program --dedication to freedom of expression for all news media, to the right of access by such media to public proceedings, and to the independence of radio, television and other news gathering media from excessive government control; --improvement, and full and fair enforcement, of the antitrust statutes, coupled with long overdue clarification of Federal policies and interpretations relating thereto in order to strengthen competition and protect the consumer and small business; --constant opposition to any form of unregulated monopoly whether business or labor; --meaningful safeguards against irreparable injuries to any domestic industries by disruptive surges of imports, such as in the case of beef and other meat products, textiles, oil, glass, coal, lumber, and steel; --enactment of law, such as the Democratic Administration vetoed in the 88th Congress, requiring that labels of imported items clearly disclose their foreign origin; --complete reorganization of the National Labor Relations Board to assure impartial protection of the rights of the public, employees, and employers, ending the defiance of Congress by the present Board; --the redevelopment of an atmosphere of confidence throughout the government and across the nation, in which vigorous competition can flourish. In all such matters it will be the Republican way to support, not harass, to encourage, not restrain, to build confidence, not threaten, to provide stability, not unrest, to speed genuine growth, not conjure up statistical fantasies, and to assure that all actions of government apply fairly to every element of the nation's economy. In furtherance of our faith in the competitive system, we also pledge: --a continual re-examination and the reduction of government competition with private business, consistent with the recommendations of the second Hoover Commission; --elimination of excessive bureaucracy; --a full protection of the integrity of the career governmental services, military and civilian, coupled with adequate pay scales; --maximum reliance upon subordinate levels of government and individual citizens to meet the nation's needs in place of establishing even more Federal agencies to burden the people; In all such matters relating to Federal administration it will be the Republican way to provide maximum service for each tax dollar expended, watchfully superintend the size and scope of Federal activities, and assure an administration always fair, efficient and cooperatively disposed toward every element of our competitive system. Faith in Limited Government 2. We Republicans shall insist that the Federal Government have effective but limited powers, that it be frugal and efficient, and that it fully meet its Constitutional responsibilities to all the American people. For instance, we pledge: --restoration of collective-bargaining, responsibility to labor and management, minimizing third-party intervention and preventing any agency of government from becoming an advocate for any economic interest; --development of truly voluntary commodity programs for commercial agriculture, including payments in kind, out of government-owned surpluses, diversion of unneeded land to conservation uses, price supports free of political manipulation in order to stimulate and obtain fair market prices together with adequate credit facilities and continued support of farmer owned and operated cooperatives including rural electric and telephone facilities, while resisting all efforts to make the farmer dependent for his economic survival, upon either compensatory payments by the Federal Government or upon the whim of the Secretary of Agriculture; --full cooperation of all governmental levels and private enterprise in advancing the balanced use of the nation's natural resources to provide for man's multiple needs; --continuing review of public-land laws and policies to assure minimum opportunity for all beneficial uses of the public lands including the development of mineral resources; --comprehensive water-resource planning and development, including projects for our growing cities, expanded research and desalenization of water, and continued support of multipurpose reclamation projects; --support of sustained-yield management for our forests and expanded research for control of forest insects, disease, and forest fires; --protection of traditional domestic fishing grounds and other actions, including tax incentives, to encourage modernization of fishing vessels, and improved processing and marketing practices; --continued tax support to encourage exploration and developemnt of domestic sources of minerals and metals with reasonable depletion allowances; --stabilization of present oil programs, private development of atomic power, increased coal research and expansion of coal exports; --a replanning of the present space program to provide for a more orderly, yet agressively pursued, step-by-step, development, remaining alert to the dangers of overdiversion of skilled personnel in critical shortage from other vital areas such as health, industry, education and science. In furtherance of our faith in limited, frugal and efficient government we also pledge: --credit against Federal taxes for specified State and local taxes paid, and a transfer to the State of excise and other Federal tax sources to reinforce the fiscal strength of state and local government so they may better meet rising school costs and other pressing urban and suburban problems, such as transportation, housing, water systems and juvenile delinquency; --emphasis upon channeling more private capital into sound urban development projects and private housing; --critical re-examination and major overhaul of all Federal grant-in-aid programs with a view to channeling such programs through the States, discontinuing those no longer required and adjusting other in a determined effort to restore the unique balance and creative energy of the traditional American system of government; --revitalization of municipal and county governments throughout America by encouraging them, and private citizens as well to develop new solutions of their major concerns through a streamlining and modernizing of state and local processes of government, not through Federal action, but through their own capabilities; --support of a Constitutional amendment, as well as legislation, enabling States having bicameral legislatures to apportion on House on bases of their choosing including factors other than population; --complete reform of the tax structure, to include simplification as well as lower rates to strengthen individual and business incentives; --effective budgetary reform, improved Congressional appropriation procedures and full implementation of the antideficiency stature; --a wide range reform of other Congressional procedures, including the provision of adequate professional staff assistance for the minority membership on Congressional Committees, to insure that the power and prestige of Congress remain adequate to the needs of the time; --high priority for the solution of the nation's balance of payments difficulties to assure unquestioned confidence in the dollar maintenance of the competitiveness of American products in domestic and foreign markets expansion of exports, stimulation of foreign tourism in the United States greater foreign sharing of mutual security burdens abroad, a drastic reorganization and redirection of the entire foreign-aid effort gradual reductions in overseas United States forces as manpower can be replaced by increased firepower and strengthening of the international monetary system without sacrifice of our freedom of policy-making. In all such matters, it will be the Republican way to achieve not feigned but genuine savings, allowing a reduction of the public debt and additional tax reductions while meeting the proper responsibilities of government. We pledge an especially determined effort to help strengthen the ability of State and local governments to meet the broad range of needs facing the nation's urban and suburban communities. SECTION FOUR Freedom Abroad The Republican commitment to individual freedom applies no less abroad. America must advance freedom throughout the world as a vital condition of orderly human progress, universal justice, and the security of the American people. The supreme challenge to this policy is an atheistic imperialism-Communism. Our nation's leadership must be judged by, indeed, America's independence and even survival are dependent upon, the stand it takes toward Communism. That stand must be victory for freedom. there can be no peace, there can be no security, until this goal is won. As long as Communist leaders remain ideologically fixed upon ruling the world, there can be no lesser goal. This is the supreme test of America's foreign policy. It must not be defaulted. In the balance is human liberty every place on earth. Reducing the Risks of War A dynamic strategy aimed at victory, pressing always for initiatives for freedom, rejecting always appeasement and withdrawal, reduces the risk of nuclear war. It is a nation's vacillation, not firmness, that tempts an aggressor into war. It is accommodation, not opposition, that encourages a hostile nation to remain hostile and to remain aggressive. The road to peace is a road not of fawning amiability but of strength and respect. Republicans judge foreign policy by its success in advancing freedom and justice, not by its effect on international prestige polls. In making foreign policy, these will be our guidelines: Trusting Ourselves and Our Friends 1. Secrecy in foreign policy must be at a minimum, public understanding at a maximum. Our own citizens, rather than those of other nations, should be accorded primary trust. 2. Consultation with our allies should take precedence over direct negotiations with Communist powers. The by-passing of our allies has contributed greatly to the shattering of free-world unity and to the loss of free-world continuity in opposing Communism. Communism's Course 3. We reject the notion that Communism has abandoned its goal of world domination, or that fat and well-fed Communists are less dangerous than lean and hungry ones. We also reject the notion that the United States should take sides in the Sino-Soviet rift. Republican foreign policy starts with the assumption that Communism is the enemy of this nation in every sense until it can prove that its enemity has been abandoned. 4. We hold that trade with Communist countries should not be directed toward the enhancement of their power and influence but could only be justified if it would serve to diminish their power. 5. We are opposed to the recognition of Red China. We oppose its admission into the United Nations. We steadfastly support free China. 6. In negotiations with Communists, Republicans will probe tirelessly for reasonable, practicable and trustworthy agreements. However, we will never abandon insistence on advantages for the free world. 7. Republicans will continue to work for the realization of the Open Skies policy proposed in 1955 by President Eisenhower. Only open societies offer real hope of confidence among nations. Communism's Captives 8. Republicans reaffirm their long-standing commitment to a course leading to eventual liberation of the Communist-dominated nations of Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America including the peoples of Hungary, Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Rumania, Albania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Armenia, Ukraine, Yugoslavia and its Serbian, Croatian, and Slovene peoples, Cuba, mainland China, and many others. We condemn the persecution of minorities, such as the Jews, within Communist borders. The United Nations 9. Republicans support the United Nations. However we will never rest in our efforts to revitalize its original purpose. We will press for a change in the method of voting in the General Assembly and in the specialized agencies that will reflect population disparities among the member states and recognize differing abilities and willingness to meet the obligations of the Charter. We will insist upon General Assembly acceptance of the International Court of Justice advisory opinion, upholding denial of the votes of member nations which refuse to meet properly levied assessments so that the United Nations will more accurately reflect the power realities of the world. Further, to assure the carrying out of these recommendations and to correct the above abuses, we urge the calling of an amending convention of the United Nations by the year 1967. Republicans will never surrender to any international group the responsibility of the United States for its sovereignty, its own security, and the leadership of the free world. NATO: The Great Shield 10. Republicans regard NATO as indispensable for the prevention of war and the protection of freedom. NATO's unity and vitality have alarmingly deteriorated under the present Administration. It is a keystone of Republican foreign policy to revitalize the Alliance. To hasten its restoration, Republican leadership will move immediately to establish an international commission, comprised of individuals of high competence in NATO affairs, whether in or out of government, to explore and recommend effective new ways to strengthen alliance participation and fulfillment. Freedom's Further Demands 11. To our nation's associates in SEATO and CENTO, Republicans pledge reciprocal dedication of purpose and revitalized interest. These great alliances, with NATO, must be returned to the forefront of foreign policy planning. A strengthened alliance system is equally necessary in the Western Hemisphere. This will remain our constant purpose: Republicans will labor tirelessly with free men everywhere and in every circumstance toward the defeat of Communism and victory for freedom. The Geography of Freedom 12. In diverse regions of the world, Republicans will make clear to any hostile nation that the United States will increase the costs and risks of aggression to make them outweigh hopes for gain. It was just such a communication and determination by the Eisenhower Republican Administration that produced the 1953 Korean Armistice. The same strategy can win victory for freedom and stop further aggression in Southeast Asia. We will move decisively to assure victory in South Vietnam. While confining the conflict as closely as possible America must move to end the fighting in a reasonable time and provide guarantees against further aggression. We must make it clear to the Communist world that, when conflict is forced with America, it will end only in victory for freedom. We will demand that the Berlin Wall be taken down prior to the resumption of any negotiations with the Soviet Union on the status of forcess in, or treaties affecting, Germany. We will reassure our German friends that the United States will not accept any plan for the future of Germany which lacks firm assurance of a free election on reunification. We will urge the immediate implementation of the Caracas Declaration of Solidarity against international Communist intervention endorsed in 1954 by the Organization of American States during the Eisenhower Administration which Declaration, in accordance with the historic Monroe Doctrine, our nation's official policy since 1823, opposes domination of any of our neighbor-nations by any power outside this Hemisphere. We will vigorously press our OAS partners to join the United States in restoring a free and independent government in Cuba stopping the spread of Sino-Soviet subversion, forcing the withdrawal of the foreign military presence now in the Latin America and preventing further intrusions. We Reublicans will recognize a Cuban government in exile; we will support its efforts to regain the independence of its homeland; we will assist Cuban freedom fighters in carrying on guerrilla warfare against the Communist regime; we will work for an economic boycott by all nations of the free world in trade with Cuba; and we will encourage free elections in cuba after liberty and stability are restored. We will consider raising the economic participation of the Republic of panama in the operation of the Panama Canal and assure the safety of Americans in the area. We will reaffirm this nation's treaty rights and study the feasibility of a substitute, sea-level canal at an appropriate location including the feasibility of nuclear excavation. Republicans will make clear to all Communists now supporting or planning to support guerrilla and subversive activities, that henceforth there will be no privileged sanctuaries to protect those who disrupt the peace of the world. We will make clear that blockade, interception of logistical support, and diplomatic and economic pressure are appropriate United States counters to deliberate breaches of the peace. We will make clear to all Communist leaders everywhere that aggressive actions, including those in the German air corridors, will be grounds for re-evaluation of any and all trade or diplomatic relations currently to Communism's advantage. We will take the cold-war offensive on all fronts, including, for example, a reinvigorated USIA (United States Information Agency). It will broadcast not our weaknesses but our strengths. It will mount a psychological-warfare attack on behalf of freedom and against Communist doctrine and imperialism. Republicans will recast foreign-aid programs. We will see that all will serve the cause of freedom. We will see that none bolster and sustain anti-American regimes we will increase the use of private capital on a partnership basis with foreign nations, as a means of fostering independence and mutual respect but we assert that property of American Nationals must not be expropriated by any foreign government without prompt and adequate compensation as contemplated by international law. Tespecting the Middle East, and in addition to our reaffirmed pledges of 1960 concerning this area, we will so direct our economic and military assistance as to help maintain stability in this region and prevent an imbalance of arms. Finally, we will improve the efficiency and coordination of the career foreign service, and provide adequate allowances for foreign service personnel. The Development of Freedom 13. Freedom's wealth must never support freedom's decline, always its growth. America's tax revenues derived from free enterprise sources must never be employed in support of socialism. America must assist young and underdeveloped nations. In the process, however, we must not sacrifice the trust of old friends. Our assistance, also, must be conditional upon self-help and progress toward the development of free institutions. We favor the establishment in underdeveloped nations of an economic and political climate that will encourage the investment of local capital and attract the investment of foreign capital. Freedom's Shield--and Sword Finally, Republicans pledge to keep the nation's sword sharp, ready, and dependable. We will maintain a superior, not merely equal, military capability as long as the Communist drive for world domination continues. It will be a capability of balanced force, superior in all its arms, maintaining flexibility for effective performance in the rapidly changing science of war. Republicans will never unilaterally disarm America. We will demand that any arms-reduction plan worthy of consideration guarantee reliable inspection. We will demand that any such plan assure this nation of sufficient strength, step by step, to forestall and defend against possible violations. We will take every step necessary to carry forward the vital military research and development programs. We will pursue these programs as absolutely necessary to assure our nation of superior strength in the 1970s. We will revitalize research and development programs needed to enable the nation to develop advanced new weapons systems, strategic as well as tactical. We will include the fields of antisubmarine warfare, astronautics and aeronautics, special guerrilla forces, and such other defense systems required to keep America ready for any threat. We will fully implement such safeguards as our security requires under the limited nuclear-test-ban treaty. We will conduct advanced tests in permissible areas, maintain facilities to test elsewhere in case of violations, and develop to the fullest our ability to detect Communist transgressions. Additionally, we will regularly review the status of nuclear weaponry under the limited nuclear-test-ban to assure this nation's protection. We shall also provide sensible, continuing reviews of the treaty itself. We will end ""second best"" weapons policies. We will end the false economies which place price ahead of the performance upon which American lives may depend. Republicans will bring an end once again to the ""peak and valley"" defense planning, so costly in morale and strength as well as in dollars. We will prepare a practical civil-defense program. We will restore the morale of our armed forces by upgrading military professionalism, and we will allow professional dissent while insuring that strong and sound civilian authority controls objective decision-making. We will return the Joint Chiefs of Staff to their lawful status as the President's principal military advisors. We will insure that an effective planning and operations staff is restored to the National Security Council. We will reconsecrate this nation to human liberty, assuring the freedom of our own people, and rallying mankind to a new crusade for freedom all around the world. We Republicans, with the help of Almighty God, will keep those who would bury America aware that this nation has the strength and also the will to defend its every interest. Those interests, we shall make clear, include the preservation and expansion of freedom, and ultimately its victory every place on earth. We do not offer the easy way. We offer dedication and perseverance, leading to victory. This is our Platform. This is the Republican way.",57608,8739,"""for the people"" section one for a free people humanity is tormented once again by an age-old issue, is man to live in dignity and freedom under god or be enslaved, are men in government to serve, or are they to master, their fellow men? it befalls us now to resolve this issue anew, perhaps this time for centuries to come. nor can we evade the issue here at home. even in this constitutional republic, for two centuries the beacon of liberty the world over, individual freedom retreats under the mounting assault of expanding centralized power. fiscal and economic excesses, too long indulged, already have eroded and threatened the greatest experiment in self-government mankind has known. we republicans claim no monopoly of love of freedom. but we challenge as unwise the course the democrats have charted we challenge as dangerous the steps they plan along the way and we deplore as self-defeating and harmful many of the moves already taken. dominant in their council are leaders whose words extol human liberty, but whose deeds have persistently delimited the scope of liberty and sapped its vitality. year after year, in the name of benevolence, these leaders have sought the enlargement of federal power. year after year, in the guise of concern for others, they have lavishly expended the resources of their fellow citizens. and year after year freedom, diversity and individual, local and state responsibility have given way to regimentation, conformity and subservience to central power. we republicans hold that a leadership so misguided weakens liberty in america and the world. we hold that the glittering enticements so invitingly proffered the people, at their own expense will inevitably bring disillusionment and cruel disappointment in place of promised happiness. such leaders are federal extremists, impulsive in the use of national power, improvident in the management of public funds, thoughtless as to the long-term effects of their acts on individual freedom and creative, competitive enterprise. men so recklessly disposed cannot be safely entrusted with authority over their fellow citizens. to republicans, liberty is still today man's most precious possession. for every citizen, and for the generations to come, we republicans vow, that it shall be preserved. in substantiation of this belief the republican party submits this platform. to the american people it is our solemn bond. to stay free the shape of the future is our paramount concern. much of today's moral decline and drift, much of the prevailing preoccupation with physical and material comforts of life, much of today's crass political appeals to the appetites of the citizenry can be traced to a leadership grown demagogic and materialistic through indifference to national ideals founded in devoutly held religious faith. the republican party seeks not to renounce this heritage of faith and high purpose rather, we are determined to reaffirm and reapply it. so doing, these will be our guides: . every person has the right to govern himself, to fix his own goals, and to make his own way with a minimum of governmental interference. . it is for government to foster and maintain an environment of freedom encouraging every individual to develop to the fullest his god-given powers of mind, heart and body and, beyond this, government should undertake only needful things, rightly of public concern, which the citizen cannot himself accomplish. we republicans hold that these two principles must regain their primacy in our government's relations, not only with the american people, but also with nations and peoples everywhere in the world. . within our republic the federal government should act only in areas where it has constitutional authority to act, and then only in respect to proven needs where individuals and local or state governments will not or cannot adequately perform. great power, whether governmental or private, political or economic, must be so checked balanced and restrained and where necessary, so dispersed as to prevent it from becoming a threat to freedom any place in the land. . it is a high mission of government to help assure equal opportunity for all, affording every citizen an equal chance at the starting line but never determining who is to win or lose. but government must also reflect the nation's compassionate concern for those who are unable, through no fault of their own, to provide adequately for themselves. . government must be restrained in its demands upon and its use of the resources of the people, remembering that it is not the creator but the steward of the wealth it uses that its goals must over discipline its means and that service to all the people, never to selfish or partisan ends, must be the abiding purpose of men entrusted with public power. deeds not words the future we pledge, then, for freedom, by faithful adherence to these guides. let the people compare these guides with those of the democratic party, then test not the words of the two parties but their performance during the past four years of democratic control. let the people ask: is the republic stronger today or wiser than when the present administration took office four years ago? is its guardianship of freedom more respected at home and throughout the world? for these four years the leaders of the democratic party have been entrusted with the nation's executive power and overwhelmingly in control of the congress. the question must be asked: have these leaders successfully advanced the purposes of this mightiest nation mankind has known? tragically, in each instance, the answer must be ""no"". let the democratic party stand accused. section two failures of foreign policy this democratic administration has been, from its beginning, not the master but the prisoner of major events. the will and dependability of its leadership, even for the defense of the free world, come to be questioned in every area of the globe. disregard of allies this administration has neglected to consult with america's allies on critical matters at critical times, leading to lack of confidence, lack of respect and disintergrating alliances. it has permitted an erosion of nato force and unity, alienating most of its member nations by negotiating with the common foe behind their backs. it has offered concessions to the communists while according our allies little understanding, patience, or cooperation. this administration has created discord and distrust by failing to develop a nuclear policy for nato. it has provoked crises of confidence with our oldest friends, including england and france, by bungling such major projects as skybolt and nato's nuclear needs. it has allowed other great alliances, seato and cento, also to deteriorate, by failing to provide the leadership required for their revitalization and by neglecting their cooperation in keeping the peace. weakness before communism this administration has sought accommodations with communism without adequate safeguards and compensating gains for freedom. it has alienated proven allies by opening a ""hot line"" first with a sworn enemy rather than with a proven friend, and in general pursued a risky path such as began at munich a quarter century ago. it has misled the american people and forfeited a priceless opportunity to win concessions for freedom by mishandling sales of farm commodities to communists. at first it disavowed any intent to subsidize prices or use credit later it demanded such authority and forced the democrats in congress to acquiesce. at first it hinted at concessions for freedom in return for wheat sold to russia later it obtained no concessions at all. at first it pledged not to breach retraints on trade with communist countries in other parts of the world later it stimulated such trade itself, and thus it encouraged trade with cuba by america's oldest friends. this administration has collaborated with indonesian imperialism by helping it to acquire territory belonging to the netherlands and control over the papuan people. it has abetted further communist take-over in laos, weakly accepted communist violations of the geneva agreement, which the present administration perpetrated, and increased soviet influence in southeast asia. it has encouraged an increase of aggression in south vietnam by appearing to set limits on america's willingness to act and then, in the deepening struggle it has sacrificed the lives of american and allied fighting men by denial of modern equipment. this administration has permitted the shooting down of american pilots, the mistreatment of american citizens, and the destruction of american property to become hallmarks of communist arrogance. it has stood by as a wire barricade in berlin became a wall of shame, defacing that great city, humiliating every american, and disgracing free men everywhere. it has turned its back on the captive peoples of eastern europe abandoning their cause in the united nations and in the official utterances of our government. this administration has forever blackened our nation's honor at the bay of pigs, bungling the invasion plan and leaving brave men on cuban beaches to be shot down. later the forsaken survivors were ransomed, and communism was allowed to march deeper into latin america. it has turned a deaf ear to pleas from throughout the western hemisphere for decisive american leadership to seal off subversion from the soviet base just off our shore. it has increased the long term troubles for america by retreating from its pledge to obtain on-the-spot proof of the withdrawal of soviet offensive weapons from cuba. it left vacant for many critical months the high posts of ambassador in panama and with the organization of american states and thus it failed to anticipate and forestall the anti-american violence that burst forth in panama. undermining the united nations this administration has failed to provide forceful, effective leadership in the united nations. it has weakened the power and influence of this world organization by failing to demand basic improvements in its procedures and to guard against its becoming merely a forum of anti-western insult and abuse. it has refused to insist upon enforcement of the united nations' rules governing financial support though such enforcement is supported by an advisory opinion of the international court of justice. it has shouldered virtually the full costs of the united nations' occupation of the congo, only to have the ousted leadership asked back when united nations forces had withdrawn. forsaking america's interests this administration has subsidized various forms of socialism throughout the world, to the jeopardy of individual freedom and private enterprise. it has proved itself inept and weak in international trade negotiations, allowing the loss of opportunities historically open to american enterprise and bargaining away markets indispensable to prosperity on american farms. failure of national security planning losing a critical lead this administration has delayed research and development in advanced weapons systems and thus confronted the american people with the fearsome possibility that soviet advances, in the decade of the nineteen seventies, may surpass america's present lead. its misuse of ""cost effectiveness"" has stifled the creativity of the nation's military, scientific and industrial communities. it has failed to originate a single new major strategic weapons system after inheriting from a republican administration the most powerful military force of all time. it has concealed a lack of qualitative advance for the nineteen seventies by speaking of a quantitative strength which by then will be obsolete. it has not demonstrated the foresight necessary to prepare a strategic strength which in future years will deter war. it has endangered security by downgrading efforts to prepare defenses against enemy ballistic missiles. it has retarded our own military development for near and outer space, while the enemy's development moves on. invitations to disaster this administration has adopted policies which will lead to a potentially fatal parity of power with communism instead of continued military superiority for the united states. it has permitted disarmament negotiations to proceed without adequate consideration of military judgment of procedure which tends to bring about, in effect, a unilateral curtailment of american arms rendered the more dangerous by the administration's discounting known soviet's advances in nuclear weaponry. it has failed to take minimum safeguards against possible consequences of the limited nuclear test ban treaty, including advanced underground tests where permissible and full readiness to test elsewhere should the need arise. distortions and blackouts this administration has adopted the policies of news management and unjustifiable secrecy, in the guise of guarding the nation's security it has shown a contempt of the right of the people to know the truth. this administration, while claiming major defense savings, has in fact raised defense spending by billions of dollars a year, and yet has shortchanged critical areas. undermining morale this administration has weakened the bonds of confidence and understanding between civilian leaders and the nations top military professionals. it has by-passed seasoned military judgment in vital national security policy decisions. it has permitted nonmilitary considerations, political as well as economic, to reverse professional judgment on major weapons and equipment such as the controversial tfx, the x-, and the nuclear carrier. in sum, both in military and foreign affairs, the democratic record all the world around is one of disappointment and reverses for freedom. and this record is no better at home. failures aa home inability to create jobs this administration has failed to honor its pledges to assure good jobs, full prosperity and a rapidly growing economy for all the american people: --failing to reduce unemployment to percent falling far short of its announced goal every single month of its tenure in office; and --despite glowing promises, allowing a disheartening increase in long-term and youth unemployment. this administration has failed to apply republican-initiated retraining programs where most needed, particularly where they could afford new economic opportunities to negro citizens. it has preferred instead, divisive political proposals. it has demonstrated its inability to measure up to the challenge of automation which, wisely guided, will enrich the lives of all people. administration approaches have been negative and unproductive, as for example the proposed penalties upon the use of overtime. such penalties would serve only to spread existing unemployment and injure those who create jobs. it has failed to perform its responsibility under republican amendments to the manpower training act. it has neglected, for example, the basic requirement of developing a dictionary of labor skills which are locally, regionally and nationally in short supply, even though many thousands of jobs are unfilled today for lack of qualified applicants. failing the poor this administration has refused to take practical free enterprise measures to help the poor. under the last republican administration, the percentage of poor in the country dropped encouragingly from percent to percent. by contrast the present administration despite a massive increase in the federal bureaucracy, has managed a mere two percentage point reduction. this administration has proposed a so-called war on poverty which characteristically overlaps, and often contradicts, the existing federal poverty programs. it would dangerously centralize federal controls and by-pass effective state, local and private programs. it has demonstrated little concern for the acute problems created for the poor by inflation. consumer prices have increased in the past three and a half years by almost percent amounting in effect to a percent national sales tax on the purchases of a family living on fixed income. under housing and urban renewal programs, notably in the nation's capital, it has created new slums by forcing the poor from their homes to make room for luxury apartments, while neglecting the vital need for adequate relocation assistance. retarding enterprises this administration has violently thrust federal power into the free market in such areas as steel prices, thus establishing precedents which in future years could critically wound free enterprise in the united states. it has so discouraged private enterprise that the annual increase in the number of businesses has plummeted from the republican level of , a year to , a year. it has allowed the rate of business failures to rise higher under its leadership than in any period since depression days. it has aggravated the problems of small business by multiplying federal record-keeping requirements and has hurt thousands of small businessmen by forcing up their costs. this administration has curtailed, through such agencies as the national labor relations board, the simple, basic right of americans voluntarily to go out of business. it has failed to stimulate new housing and attract more private capital into the field. in the past years it has fallen short by one million five hundred thousand units of meeting its pledge of two million new homes each year. it has sought to weaken the patent system which is so largely responsible for america's progress in technology, medicine and science. it has required private electric power companies to submit to unreasonable federal controls as a condition to the utilization of rights-of-way over public lands. it has sought to advance, without congressional authorization, a vastly expensive nationwide electrical transmission grid. betrayal of the farmer this administration has refused, incredibly, to honor the clear mandate of american wheat farmers, in the largest farm referendum ever held, to free them of rigid federal controls and to restore their birthright to make their own management decisions. it has strangled the republican rural development program with red tape and neglected its most essential ingredient, local initiative. it has broken its major promises to farm people, dropping the parity ratio to its lowest level since . it has dumped surplus stocks so as to lower farm income and increase the vicious cost-price squeeze of the farmer. it has evidenced hostility toward american livestock producers by proposals to establish mandatory marketing quotas on livestocks, to fine and imprison dairy farmers failing to maintain federally acceptable records, and to establish a subsidized grazing cropland conversion program. it has allowed imports of beef and other meat products to rise to an all-time high during a slump in cattle prices which was aggravated by government grain sales. neglect of natural resources this administration has delayed the expeditious handling of oil shale patent applications and the early development of a domestic oil shale industry. it has allowed the deterioration of the domestic mining and petroleum industries including displacement of domestic markets by foreign imports. it has failed to protect the american fishing industry and has retreated from policies providing equitable sharing of internation fishing grounds. fiscal irresponsibility this administration has misled the american people by such budget manipulations as crowding spending into the previous fiscal year, presenting a proposal to sell off two and one-third billion dollars in government assets as a cut in spending, and using bookkeeping devices to make expenditures seem smaller than they actually are. it has, despite pledges of economy, burdened this nation with four unbalanced budgets in a row, creating deficits totaling billion dollars, with still more debt to come, reflecting a rate of sustained deficit spending unmatched in peacetime. it has failed to establish sensible priorities for federal funds. in consequence it has undertaken needlessly expensive crash programs, as for example accelerating a trip to the moon, to the neglect of other critical needs such as research into health and the increasingly serious problems of air and water pollution and urban crowding. this administration has continued to endanger retirement under social security for millions of citizens; it has attempted to overload the system with costly, unrelated programs which ignore the dangers of overly regressive taxation and the unfairness of forcing the poor to finance such programs for the rich. it has demanded the elimination of a substantial portion of personal income tax deductions for charitable and church contributions, for real property taxes paid by home owners, and for interest payments. elimination of these deductions would impose great hardship upon millions of our citizens and discourage the growth of some of the finest organizations in america. this administration has impeded investigations of suspected wrongdoing which might implicate public officials in the highest offices in the land. it has thus aroused justifiable resentment against those who use the high road of public service as the low road to illicitly acquired wealth. it has permitted the quality and morale of the postal system to deteriorate and drastically restricted its service. it has made the post office almost inaccessible to millions of working people, reduced the once admired parcel post system to a national laughing stock, and yet it is intimated that american may soon have to pay eight cents for a first-class postage stamp. it has resisted personal income tax credits for education, always preferring the route leading to federal control over our schools. some leading democrats have even campaigned politically in favor of such tax credits while voting against them in congress. contrary to the intent of the manpower training act, it has sought to extend department of labor influence over vocational education. discord and discontent this administration has exploited interracial tensions by extravagant campaign promises, without fulfillment, playing on the just aspirations of the minority groups, encouraging disorderly and lawless elements, and ineffectually administering the laws. it has subjected career civil servants and part-time federal employees including employees of the agriculture department to political pressures harmful to the integrity of the entire federal service. it has weakened veterans preference in federal jobs. it has made federal intervention, even on the presidential level, a standard operating practice in labor disputes, thus menacing the entire system of free collective-bargaining. it has resorted to police state tactics using the great power of federal departments and agencies, to compel compliance with administration desires, notably in the steel price dispute. the department of justice, in particular, has been used improperly to achieve partisan political, economic and legislative goals. this abuse of power should be the subject of a congressional investigation. weakening responsibility this administration has moved, through such undertakings as its so-called war on poverty, accelerated public works and the new communities program in the housing proposal to establish new federal offices duplicating existing agencies, by-passing the state capitols, thrusting aside local government, and siphoning off to washington the administration of private citizen and community affairs. it has undermined the federally assisted, state-operated medical and hospital assistance program, while using, and abusing, federal authority to force a compulsory hospital program upon the people and the congress. this enumeration is necessarily incomplete. it does not exhaust the catalogue of misdeeds and failures of the present administration. and let the nation realize that the full impact of these many ill-conceived and ill-fated activities of the democratic administration is yet to come. section three the republican alternative we republicans are not content to record democratic misdeeds and failures. we now offer policies and programs new in conception and dynamic in operation. these we urge to recapture initiative for freedom at home and abroad and to rebuild our strength at home. nor is this a new role. republican presidents from abraham lincoln to dwight d. eisenhower stand as witness that republican leadership is steadfast in principle, clear in purpose, and committed to progress. the many achievements of the eisenhower administration in strengthening peace abroad and the well-being of all at home have been unmatched in recent times. a new republican administration will stand proudly on this record. we do not submit, in this platform, extravagant promises, to be cynically cast aside after election day. rather, we offer examples of republican initiatives in areas of overriding concern to the whole nation, north, south, east and west which befit a truly national party. in the interest of brevity we do not repeat the commitments of the republican platform. ""building a better america"" and the ""declaration of republican principle and policy"". we incorporate into this platform as pledges renewed those commitments which are relevant to the problems of . these, then, will be our guides, and these our additional pledges in meeting the nation's needs. faith in the individual . we republicans shall rely on the individual's rights and capacities to advance his own economic well-being, to control the fruits of his efforts and to plan his own and his family's future and, where government is rightfully involved, we shall assist the individual in surmounting urgent problems beyond his own power and responsibility to control. for instance, we pledge: --enlargement of employment opportunities for urban and rural citizens, with emphasis on training programs to equip them with needed skills improved job information and placement services and research and extension services channeled toward helping rural people improve their own opportunities; --tax credits and other methods of assistance to help needy senior citizens meet the costs of medical and hospital insurance; --a strong, sound system of social security, with improved benefits to our people; --continued federal support for a sound research program aimed at both the prevention and care of diseases and intensified efforts to secure prompt and effective application of the results of research. this will include emphasis on illness drug addiction alcoholism cancer heart disease and other diseases of increasing incidence; --revision of the social security laws to allow higher earnings without loss of benefits by our elderly people; --full coverage of all medical and hospital costs of needy elder people financed by general revenues through broader implementation of federal-state plans, rather than the compulsory democratic scheme covering only a small percentage of such costs, for everyone regardless of need; --adoption and implementation of a fair and adequate program for providing necessary supplemental farm labor for producing and harvesting agricultural commodities; --tax credits for those burdened by the expenses of college education; --vocational rehabilitation through cooperation between government, federal and state, and industry, for the mentally and physically handicapped, the chronically unemployed and the poverty stricken; --incentives for employers to hire teen-agers, including broadening of temporary exemptions under the minimum wage law; --to repeal the administration's wheat-certificate ""bread tax"" on consumers, so burdensome to low-income families and overwhelmingly rejected by farmers --revision of present nonservice-connected pension programs to provide increased benefits for low-income pensioners, with emphasis on rehabilitation nursing homes and world war i veterans; --re-evaluation of the armed forces' manpower procurement programs with the goal of replacing involuntary inductions as soon as possible by an efficient voluntary system offering real career incentives; --enactment of legislation, despite democratic opposition, to curb the flow through the mails of obscene material which has flourished into a multimillion dollar obscenity racket; --support of a constitutional amendment permitting those individuals and groups who choose to do so to exercise their religion freely in public places, provided religious exercises are not prepared or prescribed by the state or political subdivision thereof and no person's participation therein is coerced, thus preserving the traditional separation of church and state; --full implementation and faithful execution of the civil rights act of , and all other civil rights statutes to assure equal rights and opportunities guaranteed by the constitution to every citizen --improvements of civil rights statutes adequate to changing needs of our times; --such additional administrative or legislative actions as may be required to end the denial, for whatever unlawful reason, of the right to vote; --immigration legislation seeking to reunite families and continuation of the ""fair share"" refugee program; --continued opposition to discrimination based on race, creed, national origin, or sex. we recognize that the elimination of any such discrimination is a matter of heart, conscience, and education as well as of equal rights under the law. in all such programs, where federal initiative is properly involved, to relieve or prevent misfortune or meet overpowering need, it will be the republican way to move promptly and energetically whenever possible to provide assistance of a kind enabling the individual to gain or regain the capability to make his own way and to have a fair chance to achieve his own goals. in all matters relating to human rights, it will be the republican way fully to implement all applicable laws and never to lose sight of the intense need for advancing peaceful progress in human relations in our land. the party of abraham lincoln will proudly and faithfully live up to its heritage of equal rights and equal opportunities for all. in furtherance of our faith in the individual we also pledge prudent, responsible management of the government's fiscal affairs to protect the individual against the evils of spendthrift government protecting most of all the needy and fixed-income families against the cruelest tax, inflation and protecting every citizen against the high taxes forced by excessive spending, in order that each individual may keep more of his earnings for his own and his family's use. for instance we pledge: --a reduction of not less than five billion dollars in the present level of federal spending; --an end to chronic deficit financing, proudly reaffirming our belief in a balanced budget; --further reduction in individual and corporate tax rates as fiscal discipline is restored; --repayments on the public debt; --maintenance of an administrative, legislative and regulatory climate encouraging job building enterprise to help assure every individual of a real chance for a good job; --wise, firm and responsible conduct of the nation's foreign affairs, backed by military forces kept modern, strong and ready, thereby assuring every individual of a future promising peace. in all such matters it will be the republican way so to conduct the affairs of government as to give the individual citizen the maximum assurance of a peaceful and prosperous future freed of the discouragement and hardship produced by wasteful and ineffectual government. in furtherance of our faith in the individual, we also pledge the maximum restraint of federal intrusion into matters more productively left to the individual. for instance, we pledge: --to continue republican sponsorship of practical federal state-local programs which will effectively treat the needs of the poor, while resisting direct federal handouts that erode away, individual self-reliance and self-respect and perpetuate dependency; --to continue the adancement of education on all levels, through such programs as selective aid to higher education, strengthened state and local tax resources, including tax credits for college education, while resisting the democratic efforts which endanger local control of schools; --to help assure equal opportunity and a good education for all while opposing federally sponsored ""inverse discrimination"" whether by the shifting of jobs, or the abandonment of neighborhood schools for reasons of race; --to provide our farmers, who have contributed so much to the strength of our nation, with the maximum opportunity to exercise their own management decisions of their own farms, while resisting all efforts to impose upon them further federal controls; --to establish realistic priorities for the concentration of federal spending in the most productive and creative areas such as education job training, vocation rehabilitation, educational research, oceanography, and the wise development and use of natural resources in the water as on land, while resisting democratic efforts to spend wastefully and indiscriminately; --to open avenues of peaceful progress in solving racial controversies while discouraging lawlessness and violence; in all such matters, it will be the republican way to assure the individual of maximum freedom as government meets its proper responsibility, while resisting the democratic obsession to impose from above uniform and rigid schemes for meeting varied and complex human problems. faith in the competitive system . we republicans shall vigorously protect the dynamo of economic growth, free, competitive enterprise, that has made america the envy of the world. for instance, we pledge: --removal of the wartime federal excise taxes favored by the democratic administration on pens, pencils, jewelry, cosmetics, luggage, handbags, wallets, and toiletries; --assistance to small business by simplifying federal and state tax and regulatory requirements, fostering the availability of longer term credit at fair terms and equity capital for small firms, encouraging strong state programs to foster small business, establishing more effective measures to assure a sharing of small business in federal procurement, and promoting wider export opportunities; --an end to power grabbing regulatory actions, such as the reach by the federal trade commission for injunctive powers and the ceaseless pressing by the white house, the food and drug administration and federal trade commission to dominate consumer decisions in the market place; --returning the consumer to the driver's seat as the chief regulator and chief beneficiary of a free economy, by resisting excessive concentration of power, whether public or private; --a drastic reduction in burdensome federal paper work and overlapping regulations which weigh heavily on small business men struggling to compete and to provide jobs; --a determined drive, through tough, realistic negotiations, to remove the many discriminatory and restrictive trade practices of foreign nations; --greater emphasis on overseas sales of surplus farm commodities to friendly countries through long-term credits repayable in dollars under the republican food for peace program --dedication to freedom of expression for all news media, to the right of access by such media to public proceedings, and to the independence of radio, television and other news gathering media from excessive government control; --improvement, and full and fair enforcement, of the antitrust statutes, coupled with long overdue clarification of federal policies and interpretations relating thereto in order to strengthen competition and protect the consumer and small business; --constant opposition to any form of unregulated monopoly whether business or labor; --meaningful safeguards against irreparable injuries to any domestic industries by disruptive surges of imports, such as in the case of beef and other meat products, textiles, oil, glass, coal, lumber, and steel; --enactment of law, such as the democratic administration vetoed in the 88th congress, requiring that labels of imported items clearly disclose their foreign origin; --complete reorganization of the national labor relations board to assure impartial protection of the rights of the public, employees, and employers, ending the defiance of congress by the present board; --the redevelopment of an atmosphere of confidence throughout the government and across the nation, in which vigorous competition can flourish. in all such matters it will be the republican way to support, not harass, to encourage, not restrain, to build confidence, not threaten, to provide stability, not unrest, to speed genuine growth, not conjure up statistical fantasies, and to assure that all actions of government apply fairly to every element of the nation's economy. in furtherance of our faith in the competitive system, we also pledge: --a continual re-examination and the reduction of government competition with private business, consistent with the recommendations of the second hoover commission; --elimination of excessive bureaucracy; --a full protection of the integrity of the career governmental services, military and civilian, coupled with adequate pay scales; --maximum reliance upon subordinate levels of government and individual citizens to meet the nation's needs in place of establishing even more federal agencies to burden the people; in all such matters relating to federal administration it will be the republican way to provide maximum service for each tax dollar expended, watchfully superintend the size and scope of federal activities, and assure an administration always fair, efficient and cooperatively disposed toward every element of our competitive system. faith in limited government . we republicans shall insist that the federal government have effective but limited powers, that it be frugal and efficient, and that it fully meet its constitutional responsibilities to all the american people. for instance, we pledge: --restoration of collective-bargaining, responsibility to labor and management, minimizing third-party intervention and preventing any agency of government from becoming an advocate for any economic interest; --development of truly voluntary commodity programs for commercial agriculture, including payments in kind, out of government-owned surpluses, diversion of unneeded land to conservation uses, price supports free of political manipulation in order to stimulate and obtain fair market prices together with adequate credit facilities and continued support of farmer owned and operated cooperatives including rural electric and telephone facilities, while resisting all efforts to make the farmer dependent for his economic survival, upon either compensatory payments by the federal government or upon the whim of the secretary of agriculture; --full cooperation of all governmental levels and private enterprise in advancing the balanced use of the nation's natural resources to provide for man's multiple needs; --continuing review of public-land laws and policies to assure minimum opportunity for all beneficial uses of the public lands including the development of mineral resources; --comprehensive water-resource planning and development, including projects for our growing cities, expanded research and desalenization of water, and continued support of multipurpose reclamation projects; --support of sustained-yield management for our forests and expanded research for control of forest insects, disease, and forest fires; --protection of traditional domestic fishing grounds and other actions, including tax incentives, to encourage modernization of fishing vessels, and improved processing and marketing practices; --continued tax support to encourage exploration and developemnt of domestic sources of minerals and metals with reasonable depletion allowances; --stabilization of present oil programs, private development of atomic power, increased coal research and expansion of coal exports; --a replanning of the present space program to provide for a more orderly, yet agressively pursued, step-by-step, development, remaining alert to the dangers of overdiversion of skilled personnel in critical shortage from other vital areas such as health, industry, education and science. in furtherance of our faith in limited, frugal and efficient government we also pledge: --credit against federal taxes for specified state and local taxes paid, and a transfer to the state of excise and other federal tax sources to reinforce the fiscal strength of state and local government so they may better meet rising school costs and other pressing urban and suburban problems, such as transportation, housing, water systems and juvenile delinquency; --emphasis upon channeling more private capital into sound urban development projects and private housing; --critical re-examination and major overhaul of all federal grant-in-aid programs with a view to channeling such programs through the states, discontinuing those no longer required and adjusting other in a determined effort to restore the unique balance and creative energy of the traditional american system of government; --revitalization of municipal and county governments throughout america by encouraging them, and private citizens as well to develop new solutions of their major concerns through a streamlining and modernizing of state and local processes of government, not through federal action, but through their own capabilities; --support of a constitutional amendment, as well as legislation, enabling states having bicameral legislatures to apportion on house on bases of their choosing including factors other than population; --complete reform of the tax structure, to include simplification as well as lower rates to strengthen individual and business incentives; --effective budgetary reform, improved congressional appropriation procedures and full implementation of the antideficiency stature; --a wide range reform of other congressional procedures, including the provision of adequate professional staff assistance for the minority membership on congressional committees, to insure that the power and prestige of congress remain adequate to the needs of the time; --high priority for the solution of the nation's balance of payments difficulties to assure unquestioned confidence in the dollar maintenance of the competitiveness of american products in domestic and foreign markets expansion of exports, stimulation of foreign tourism in the united states greater foreign sharing of mutual security burdens abroad, a drastic reorganization and redirection of the entire foreign-aid effort gradual reductions in overseas united states forces as manpower can be replaced by increased firepower and strengthening of the international monetary system without sacrifice of our freedom of policy-making. in all such matters, it will be the republican way to achieve not feigned but genuine savings, allowing a reduction of the public debt and additional tax reductions while meeting the proper responsibilities of government. we pledge an especially determined effort to help strengthen the ability of state and local governments to meet the broad range of needs facing the nation's urban and suburban communities. section four freedom abroad the republican commitment to individual freedom applies no less abroad. america must advance freedom throughout the world as a vital condition of orderly human progress, universal justice, and the security of the american people. the supreme challenge to this policy is an atheistic imperialism-communism. our nation's leadership must be judged by, indeed, america's independence and even survival are dependent upon, the stand it takes toward communism. that stand must be victory for freedom. there can be no peace, there can be no security, until this goal is won. as long as communist leaders remain ideologically fixed upon ruling the world, there can be no lesser goal. this is the supreme test of america's foreign policy. it must not be defaulted. in the balance is human liberty every place on earth. reducing the risks of war a dynamic strategy aimed at victory, pressing always for initiatives for freedom, rejecting always appeasement and withdrawal, reduces the risk of nuclear war. it is a nation's vacillation, not firmness, that tempts an aggressor into war. it is accommodation, not opposition, that encourages a hostile nation to remain hostile and to remain aggressive. the road to peace is a road not of fawning amiability but of strength and respect. republicans judge foreign policy by its success in advancing freedom and justice, not by its effect on international prestige polls. in making foreign policy, these will be our guidelines: trusting ourselves and our friends . secrecy in foreign policy must be at a minimum, public understanding at a maximum. our own citizens, rather than those of other nations, should be accorded primary trust. . consultation with our allies should take precedence over direct negotiations with communist powers. the by-passing of our allies has contributed greatly to the shattering of free-world unity and to the loss of free-world continuity in opposing communism. communism's course . we reject the notion that communism has abandoned its goal of world domination, or that fat and well-fed communists are less dangerous than lean and hungry ones. we also reject the notion that the united states should take sides in the sino-soviet rift. republican foreign policy starts with the assumption that communism is the enemy of this nation in every sense until it can prove that its enemity has been abandoned. . we hold that trade with communist countries should not be directed toward the enhancement of their power and influence but could only be justified if it would serve to diminish their power. . we are opposed to the recognition of red china. we oppose its admission into the united nations. we steadfastly support free china. . in negotiations with communists, republicans will probe tirelessly for reasonable, practicable and trustworthy agreements. however, we will never abandon insistence on advantages for the free world. . republicans will continue to work for the realization of the open skies policy proposed in by president eisenhower. only open societies offer real hope of confidence among nations. communism's captives . republicans reaffirm their long-standing commitment to a course leading to eventual liberation of the communist-dominated nations of eastern europe, asia and latin america including the peoples of hungary, poland, east germany, czechoslovakia, rumania, albania, bulgaria, latvia, lithuania, estonia, armenia, ukraine, yugoslavia and its serbian, croatian, and slovene peoples, cuba, mainland china, and many others. we condemn the persecution of minorities, such as the jews, within communist borders. the united nations . republicans support the united nations. however we will never rest in our efforts to revitalize its original purpose. we will press for a change in the method of voting in the general assembly and in the specialized agencies that will reflect population disparities among the member states and recognize differing abilities and willingness to meet the obligations of the charter. we will insist upon general assembly acceptance of the international court of justice advisory opinion, upholding denial of the votes of member nations which refuse to meet properly levied assessments so that the united nations will more accurately reflect the power realities of the world. further, to assure the carrying out of these recommendations and to correct the above abuses, we urge the calling of an amending convention of the united nations by the year . republicans will never surrender to any international group the responsibility of the united states for its sovereignty, its own security, and the leadership of the free world. nato: the great shield . republicans regard nato as indispensable for the prevention of war and the protection of freedom. nato's unity and vitality have alarmingly deteriorated under the present administration. it is a keystone of republican foreign policy to revitalize the alliance. to hasten its restoration, republican leadership will move immediately to establish an international commission, comprised of individuals of high competence in nato affairs, whether in or out of government, to explore and recommend effective new ways to strengthen alliance participation and fulfillment. freedom's further demands . to our nation's associates in seato and cento, republicans pledge reciprocal dedication of purpose and revitalized interest. these great alliances, with nato, must be returned to the forefront of foreign policy planning. a strengthened alliance system is equally necessary in the western hemisphere. this will remain our constant purpose: republicans will labor tirelessly with free men everywhere and in every circumstance toward the defeat of communism and victory for freedom. the geography of freedom . in diverse regions of the world, republicans will make clear to any hostile nation that the united states will increase the costs and risks of aggression to make them outweigh hopes for gain. it was just such a communication and determination by the eisenhower republican administration that produced the korean armistice. the same strategy can win victory for freedom and stop further aggression in southeast asia. we will move decisively to assure victory in south vietnam. while confining the conflict as closely as possible america must move to end the fighting in a reasonable time and provide guarantees against further aggression. we must make it clear to the communist world that, when conflict is forced with america, it will end only in victory for freedom. we will demand that the berlin wall be taken down prior to the resumption of any negotiations with the soviet union on the status of forcess in, or treaties affecting, germany. we will reassure our german friends that the united states will not accept any plan for the future of germany which lacks firm assurance of a free election on reunification. we will urge the immediate implementation of the caracas declaration of solidarity against international communist intervention endorsed in by the organization of american states during the eisenhower administration which declaration, in accordance with the historic monroe doctrine, our nation's official policy since , opposes domination of any of our neighbor-nations by any power outside this hemisphere. we will vigorously press our oas partners to join the united states in restoring a free and independent government in cuba stopping the spread of sino-soviet subversion, forcing the withdrawal of the foreign military presence now in the latin america and preventing further intrusions. we reublicans will recognize a cuban government in exile; we will support its efforts to regain the independence of its homeland; we will assist cuban freedom fighters in carrying on guerrilla warfare against the communist regime; we will work for an economic boycott by all nations of the free world in trade with cuba; and we will encourage free elections in cuba after liberty and stability are restored. we will consider raising the economic participation of the republic of panama in the operation of the panama canal and assure the safety of americans in the area. we will reaffirm this nation's treaty rights and study the feasibility of a substitute, sea-level canal at an appropriate location including the feasibility of nuclear excavation. republicans will make clear to all communists now supporting or planning to support guerrilla and subversive activities, that henceforth there will be no privileged sanctuaries to protect those who disrupt the peace of the world. we will make clear that blockade, interception of logistical support, and diplomatic and economic pressure are appropriate united states counters to deliberate breaches of the peace. we will make clear to all communist leaders everywhere that aggressive actions, including those in the german air corridors, will be grounds for re-evaluation of any and all trade or diplomatic relations currently to communism's advantage. we will take the cold-war offensive on all fronts, including, for example, a reinvigorated usia (united states information agency). it will broadcast not our weaknesses but our strengths. it will mount a psychological-warfare attack on behalf of freedom and against communist doctrine and imperialism. republicans will recast foreign-aid programs. we will see that all will serve the cause of freedom. we will see that none bolster and sustain anti-american regimes we will increase the use of private capital on a partnership basis with foreign nations, as a means of fostering independence and mutual respect but we assert that property of american nationals must not be expropriated by any foreign government without prompt and adequate compensation as contemplated by international law. tespecting the middle east, and in addition to our reaffirmed pledges of concerning this area, we will so direct our economic and military assistance as to help maintain stability in this region and prevent an imbalance of arms. finally, we will improve the efficiency and coordination of the career foreign service, and provide adequate allowances for foreign service personnel. the development of freedom . freedom's wealth must never support freedom's decline, always its growth. america's tax revenues derived from free enterprise sources must never be employed in support of socialism. america must assist young and underdeveloped nations. in the process, however, we must not sacrifice the trust of old friends. our assistance, also, must be conditional upon self-help and progress toward the development of free institutions. we favor the establishment in underdeveloped nations of an economic and political climate that will encourage the investment of local capital and attract the investment of foreign capital. freedom's shield--and sword finally, republicans pledge to keep the nation's sword sharp, ready, and dependable. we will maintain a superior, not merely equal, military capability as long as the communist drive for world domination continues. it will be a capability of balanced force, superior in all its arms, maintaining flexibility for effective performance in the rapidly changing science of war. republicans will never unilaterally disarm america. we will demand that any arms-reduction plan worthy of consideration guarantee reliable inspection. we will demand that any such plan assure this nation of sufficient strength, step by step, to forestall and defend against possible violations. we will take every step necessary to carry forward the vital military research and development programs. we will pursue these programs as absolutely necessary to assure our nation of superior strength in the 1970s. we will revitalize research and development programs needed to enable the nation to develop advanced new weapons systems, strategic as well as tactical. we will include the fields of antisubmarine warfare, astronautics and aeronautics, special guerrilla forces, and such other defense systems required to keep america ready for any threat. we will fully implement such safeguards as our security requires under the limited nuclear-test-ban treaty. we will conduct advanced tests in permissible areas, maintain facilities to test elsewhere in case of violations, and develop to the fullest our ability to detect communist transgressions. additionally, we will regularly review the status of nuclear weaponry under the limited nuclear-test-ban to assure this nation's protection. we shall also provide sensible, continuing reviews of the treaty itself. we will end ""second best"" weapons policies. we will end the false economies which place price ahead of the performance upon which american lives may depend. republicans will bring an end once again to the ""peak and valley"" defense planning, so costly in morale and strength as well as in dollars. we will prepare a practical civil-defense program. we will restore the morale of our armed forces by upgrading military professionalism, and we will allow professional dissent while insuring that strong and sound civilian authority controls objective decision-making. we will return the joint chiefs of staff to their lawful status as the president's principal military advisors. we will insure that an effective planning and operations staff is restored to the national security council. we will reconsecrate this nation to human liberty, assuring the freedom of our own people, and rallying mankind to a new crusade for freedom all around the world. we republicans, with the help of almighty god, will keep those who would bury america aware that this nation has the strength and also the will to defend its every interest. those interests, we shall make clear, include the preservation and expansion of freedom, and ultimately its victory every place on earth. we do not offer the easy way. we offer dedication and perseverance, leading to victory. this is our platform. this is the republican way.","['people', 'section', 'one',

Democratic Party,1968,1960,dem_1968.csv,CSV,"THE TERMS OF OUR DUTY America belongs to the people who inhabit it. The source of the nation's strength is the people's freedom to be the source of the laws governing them. To uphold this truth, when Thomas Jefferson and James Madison brought the Democratic party to birth 175 years ago, they bound it to serve the people and their government as a united whole. Today, in our 175th anniversary year, the Democratic Party in national convention assembled, again renews the covenant of our birth. We reaffirm the binding force of our inherited duty to serve the people and their government We here, therefore account for what we have done in the Democratic years since 1961. We here state what we will do when our party is again called to lead the nation. In America and in the world over, strong forces for change are on the move. Systems of thought have been jarred, ways of life uprooted, institutions are under siege. The governed challenge those who govern. We are summoned, therefore, to a fateful task - to ensure that the turmoil of change will prove to be the turmoil of birth instead of decay. We cannot stand still until we are overtaken by events. We dare not entrust our lives to the blind play of accident and force. By reflection and choice, we must make the impulse for change the agent of orderly progress. There is no alternative. In the world around us, people have patiently lived with hopes long deferred, with grievances long endured. They are now impatient with patience. Their demands for change must not only be heard, they must be answered. This is the reality the world as a whole faces. In America itself, now, and not later, is the right time to strengthen the fabric of our society by making justice and equity the cornerstones of order. Now, and not later, is the right time to uphold the rule of law by securing to all the people the natural rights that belong to them by virtue of their being human. Now, and not later, is the right time to unfurl again the flag of human patriotism and rededicate ourselves under it, to the cause of peace among nations. Now, and not later, is the right time to reclaim the strength spent in quarrels over the past and to apply that strength to America's future. Now is the right time to proceed with the work of orderly progress that will make the future become what we want it to be. It has always been the object of the Democratic Party to march at the head of events instead of waiting for them to happen It is our resolve to do that in the years ahead - just as we did in the Democratic years since 1961 when the nation was led by two Democratic Presidents and four Democratic Congresses. This We Have Done Our pride in the achievements of these Democratic years in no way blinds us to the large and unfinished tasks which still lie ahead. Just as we know where we have succeeded, we know where our efforts still fall short of our own and the nation's hopes. And we candidly recognize that the cost of trying the untried, of ploughing new ground, is bound to be occasional error, In the future, as in the past, we will confront and correct such errors as we carry our program forward. In this, we are persuaded that the Almighty judges in a different scale those who err in warmly striving to promote the common good, and those who are free from error because they risked nothing at all and were icily indifferent to good and evil alike. We are also persuaded of something else. What we have achieved with the means at hand - the social inventions we have made since 1961 in all areas of our internal life, and the initiatives we have pressed along a broad front in the world arena - gives us a clear title of right to claim that we know how to move the nation forward toward the attainment of its highest goals in a world of change. THE ECONOMY In presenting first the record of what we have achieved in the economic life of the American people, we do not view the economy as being just dollar signs divorced from the flesh and blood concerns of the people. Economics, like politics, involves people and it means people. It means for them the difference between what they don't want and what they do want. It means the difference between justice or injustice, health or sickness, better education or ignorance, a good place to live or a rat infested hovel, a good job or corrosive worry. In the Democratic years since 1961, under the leadership of Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, we managed the national economy in ways that kept the best aspirations of people in clear view, and brought them closer to fulfillment. The case was different in the 1950s, when the Republicans held the trust of national leadership. In those years, the American economy creaked and groaned from recurrent recessions. One wasteful recession came in 1954, another in 1958, and a third in 1960. The loss in national production from all three recessions and from a sluggish rate of growth-a loss that can fairly be called the GOP-gap - was a staggering $175 billion computed in today's prices. The Democratic Party, seeing the Republican inertia and the dangers it led to, promised to get America moving again. President Kennedy first made that promise for us, and we kept it. We brought an end to recurring recessions each one of which had followed closer on the heels of the Vast. Full cooperation between our government officials and all sectors of American life led to new public policies which unlocked the creative power of America's free enterprise system. The magnificent response of all the people comprising that system made the world stand in awe of the results. Since 1961, we have seen: - A 90-month period of recession-free prosperity, the longest and strongest period of sustained economic growth in American history; - A slash in the unemployment rate from 7 to under 4 percent; - An increase of nearly 40 percent in real wages and salaries and nearly one-third in the average person's real income; - And, on the eight year average, a reduction in the rate levels of the individual income tax. America's private enterprise system flourished as never before in these years of Democratic leadership. Compared with the preceding eight Republican years, private enterprise in the Democratic 1960's grew twice as fast, profits increased twice as rapidly, four times as many jobs were created, and thirteen million Americans - or one-third of those in poverty in 1960 - have today escaped its bondage. Democrats, however, were not satisfied. We saw - and were the first to see - that even sustained prosperity does not eliminate hardcore unemployment. We were the first to see that millions of Americans would never share in America's abundance unless the people as a whole, through their government, acted to supplement what the free enterprise system could do. So, under the leadership of President Johnson, this nation declared war on poverty - a war in which the government is again working in close cooperation with leaders of the free enterprise system. It would compromise the integrity of words to claim that the war on poverty and for equal opportunity has been won. Democrats are the first to insist that it has only begun - while 82 percent of the House Republicans and 69 percent of the Senate Republicans voted against even beginning it at all. Democrats know that much more remains to be done. What we have done thus far is to test a series of pilot projects before making them bigger, and we have found that they do work. Thus: - The new pre-school program known as Head Start has proven its effectiveness in widening the horizons of over two million poor children and their parents - The new programs known as the Job Corps, and the Neighborhood Youth Corps, entailing close cooperation between the government and private enterprise, have helped nearly two million unskilled boys and girls - most of them dropouts from school - get work in the community and in industry. - The new program known as Upward Bound has helped thousands of poor but talented young men and women prepare themselves for college. - The new structure of neighborhood centers brings modern community services directly to the people who need them most. THE PEOPLE We emphasize that the coldly stated statistics of gains made in the war on poverty must be translated to mean people in all their yearnings for personal fulfillment. That is true as well of all other things done in the great outpouring of constructive legislation that surpassed even the landmark years of the early New Deal. Education is one example. From the beginning of our Party history, Democrats argued that liberty and learning must find in each other the surest ground for mutual support. The inherited conviction provided the motive force behind the educational legislation of the 1960's that we enacted: - Because of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, local education has been enriched to the benefit of over 13 million young Americans; - Because of the Higher Education Act of 1965, new college classrooms, laboratories and libraries have been built to assure that higher education will not be the monopoly of the few but the right of the many; - Because of federal assistance to students, the doors to college have been opened for over a million young men and women coming from families with modest means - so that about one out of every five college students is now pursuing his higher education with some kind of federal help; - Because Democrats are convinced that the best of all investments is in the human resources represented by the youth of America, we brought about a four-fold increase in the federal investment in education since 1960. The level now approaches $12 billion annually. As it promoted better education, so did Democratic leadership promote better health for all. The program of mercy and justice known as health care for the aged, which President Truman originally proposed and Presidents Kennedy and Johnson fought for, finally became law in the summer of 1965. Because of it, more than seven million older citizens each year are now receiving modem medical care in dignity - no longer forced to depend on charity, no longer a burden on relatives, no longer in physical pain because they cannot afford to pay for the healing power of modern medicine. Virtually all older Americans, the well and the sick alike, are now protected, their lives more secure, their afflictions eased. To deal with other aspects of the nation's health needs, measures were enacted in the Democratic years representing an almost four-fold increase in the government's investment in health. Programs were enacted to cope with the killing diseases of heart, cancer and stroke; to combat mental retardation and mental illness; to increase the manpower supply of trained medical technicians; to speed the construction of new hospitals. Democrats in the Presidency and in the Congress have led the fight to erase the stain of racial discrimination that tarnished America's proudly announced proposition that all men are created equal. We knew that racial discrimination was present in every section of the country. We knew that the enforcement of civil rights and general laws are indivisible. In this conviction, Democrats took the initiative to guarantee the right to safety and security of the person, the right to all the privileges of citizenship, the right to equality of opportunity in employment, and the right to public services and accommodations and housing. For example: - Because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, all men born equal in the eyes of their Creator are by law declared to be equal when they apply for a job, or seek a night's lodging or a good meal; - Because of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the right to the ballot box - the right on which all other rights depend - has been reinforced by law; - Because of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, all families will have an equal right to live where they wish. THE NATION The frontier on which most Americans live is the vertical frontier of the city. It is a frontier whose urgent needs hold a place of very high priority on the national agenda - and on the agenda of the Democratic Party. Democrats recognize that the race to save our cities is a race against the absolute of time itself. The blight that threatens their future takes many forms. It is the physical decay of homes and neighborhoods. It is poverty and unemployment. It is broken homes and social disintegration. It is crime. It is congestion and pollution. The Democratic program attacked all of these forms of blight - and all at once. Since we know that the cities can be saved only by the people who live there, Democrats have invigorated local effort through federal leadership and assistance. In almost every city, a community action agency has mounted a many-sided assault on poverty. Through varied neighborhood organizations, the poor themselves are tackling their own problems and devising their own programs of self-help. Under Model Cities legislation, enacted in 1966, seventy-five cities are now launching the most comprehensive programs of economic, physical, and social development ever undertaken - and the number of participating cities will be doubled soon. In this effort, the residents of the areas selected to become the model neighborhoods are participating fully in planning their future and deciding what it will be. In a series of housing acts beginning in 1961, Democrats have found ways to encourage private enterprise to provide modern, decent housing for low-income and moderate-income families. The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 is the most far-reaching housing legislation in America's history. Under its terms, the genius of American business will combine with the productivity of American labor to meet a 10-year goal of 26 million new housing units - 6 million of them for the poor. The objective is to enable the poor to own their own homes, to rebuild entire neighborhoods, to spur the pace of urban renewal, and to deal more humanely with the problems of displaced people. To give our cities a spokesman of Cabinet rank, Democrats in 1965 took the lead in creating a Department of Housing and Urban Development. Democratic Presidents and Congresses halve moved with equal vigor to help the people of America's vast hinterland outside the metropolitan centers to join the march of economic progress. Of the 101 major areas classified as ""depressed areas"" when the Democrats assumed office in 1961, 90 have now solved their problems of excessive unemployment and the others are on their way. The Area Redevelopment Act, the expansion of resource development programs, and the massive effort to restore Appalachia and other lagging regions to economic health assisted the people of these areas in their remarkable progress. In these legislative undertakings of primary concern to people - American people - it is to the credit of some Republicans that they joined the Democratic majority in a common effort. Unfortunately, however, most Republicans sat passively by while Democrats wrote the legislation the nation's needs demanded Worse, and more often, Republicans did what they could to obstruct and defeat the measures that were approved by Democrats in defiance of hostile Republican votes. Thus: - In the case of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, 73 percent of the Republicans in the House voted to kill it. - In the case of medical care for the aged, 93 percent of the Republicans in the House and 64 percent in the Senate voted to kill it. - In the case of the Model Cities program, 88 percent of the Republicans in the House voted to kill it. - In the case of the program to help Appalachia, 81 percent of House Republicans and 58 percent of Senate Republicans voted to kill it, and 75 percent of House Republicans voted to kill corresponding programs of aid for other depressed regions of the country. The same negative attitude was present among Republicans in the 1950's, and one of the results was a crisis in the farm sector of the economy - which the Democrats inherited in the 1960's. In the late Republican 1950's, the glut of farm surpluses amounted to over $8 billion, and the taxpayers were forced to pay $1 billion every year in interest and storage charges alone. Democrats, however, set out resolutely to reverse the picture. Democratic farm programs supported farm income, expanded farm exports and domestic consumption, helped farmers adjust their production to the size of the expanded markets. and reduced farm surpluses and storage costs to the lowest level since 1952. Democrats have also acted vigorously to assure that American science and technology shall continue to lead the world. In atomic energy, in space exploration, in communications, in medicine, in oceanology, in fundamental and applied research in many fields, we have provided leadership and financial aid to the nation's scientists and engineers. Their genius has, in turn, powered our national economic growth. Other measures affected all Americans everywhere. Under our constitutional system of federalism, the primary responsibility for law enforcement rests with selected local officials and with governors, but the federal government can and should play a constructive role in support of state and local authorities In this conviction, Democratic leadership secured the enactment of a law which extended financial assistance to modernize local police departments, to train law enforcement personnel, and to develop modern police technology. The effect of these provisions is already visible in an improved quality of law enforcement throughout the land. Under Democratic leadership, furthermore, the Juvenile Delinquency Prevention and Control Act was passed to aid states and communities to plan and carry out comprehensive programs to prevent and combat youth crime. We have added more personnel to strengthen the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the enforcement of narcotics laws, and have intensified the campaign against organized crime. The federal government has to come swiftly to the aid of cities needing help to bring major disturbances under control, and Democratic leadership secured the enactment of a new gun control law as a step toward putting the weapons of wanton violence beyond the reach of criminal and irresponsible hands. To purify the air we breathe and the water we drink Democrats led the way to the enactment of landmark anti-pollution legislation. To bring order into the administration of transportation programs and to coordinate transportation policy, Democrats in 1966 established a new Cabinet-level Department of Transportation. For the consumer, new standards of protection were enacted - truth-in-lending and truth-in-packaging, the Child Safety Act, the Pipeline Safety Act, the Wholesome Meat and Wholesome Poultry Acts. For America's 100 million automobile drivers, auto and highway safety legislation provided protection not previously known. For every American family, unparalleled achievements in conservation meant the development of balanced outdoor recreation programs - involving magnificent new national parks, seashores, and lakeshores - all within an afternoon's drive of 110 million Americans. For the first time, we are beating the bulldozer to the nation's remaining open spaces. For the sake of living Americans and for their posterity, the Wilderness Preservation Act of 1964 placed in perpetual trust millions of acres of primitive and wilderness areas. For America's sons who manned the nation's defenses, a new G.I. bill with greatly enlarged equitable benefits was enacted gratefully and proudly. America's senior citizens enjoyed the largest increase in social security since the system was inaugurated during the Democratic Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt. For the hungry, our food distribution programs were expanded to provide more than $1 billion worth of food a year for domestic use, giving millions of children, for the first time, enough to eat. A new minimum wage law raised paychecks and standards of living for millions, while a new network of training programs enabled more than a million Americans to learn new skills and become productive workers in the labor force. A new Immigration Act removed the harsh injustice of the national origins quota system and opened our shores without discrimination to those who can contribute to the growth and strength of America. Many more measures enacted under Democratic leadership could be added to this recital of achievements in our internal life since 1961. But what we could list shares the character of what we have listed. All the measures alike are a witness to our desire to serve the people as a united whole, to chart the way for their orderly progress, to possess their confidence - by striving through our conduct to deserve to possess it. THE WORLD The conscience of the entire world has been shocked by the brutal and unprovoked Soviet aggression against Czechoslovakia. By this act, Moscow has confessed that it is still the prisoner of its fear of freedom. And the Czechoslovakian people have shown that the love of freedom, in their land and throughout Eastern Europe, can never be crushed. This severe blow to freedom and self-determination reinforces our commitment to the unending quest for peace and security in the world. These dark days should not obscure the solid achievements of the past eight years. Nuclear war has been avoided. West Berlin and Western Europe are still free. The blend of American power and restraint, so dramatically demonstrated in the Cuban missile crisis, earned the respect of the world and prepared the way for a series of arms control agreements with the Soviet Union. Long and patient negotiation by Presidents Kennedy and Johnson resulted in the Nuclear Test Ban, Nuclear Non-Proliferation, and Space treaties and the ""hot line."" These hard-won agreements provide the base for pursuing other measures to reduce the risk of nuclear war. The unprecedented expansion of the American economy has invigorated the whole free world. Many once skeptical nations, including some communist states, now regard American economic techniques and institutions as a model. In Asia the tragic Vietnam war has often blinded us to the quiet and constructive developments which affect directly the lives of over a billion people and the prospects for peace everywhere. An economically strong and democratic Japan has assumed a more active role in the development of the region. Indonesia has a nationalist, non-Communist government seeking to live at peace with its neighbors. Thailand, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Republic of Korea have more stable governments and steadily growing economies. They have been aided by American economic assistance and by the American military presence in the Pacific. They have also been encouraged by a confidence reflecting successive Presidential decisions to assist nations to live in peace and freedom. Elsewhere in the developing world, there has been hopeful political and economic progress. Though Castro's Cuba is still a source of subversion, the other Latin American states are moving ahead under the Alliance for Progress. In Africa, many of the new states have chosen moderate leaders committed to peaceful nation-building. They are beginning to cooperate with their neighbors in regional agencies of their own design. And like developing countries on other continents, they are for the first time giving serious attention to agricultural development. This new emphasis on food will buy time to launch effective programs of population control. In all these constructive changes America, under Democratic leadership, has played a significant role. But we Democrats do not believe in resting on past achievements. We view any success as a down payment on the hard tasks that lie ahead. There is still much to be done at home and abroad and we accept with confidence the challenge of the future. This We Will Do TOWARD A PEACEFUL WORLD In the pursuit of our national objectives and in the exercise of American power in the world, we assert that the United States should: - Continue to accept its world responsibilities - not turn inward and isolate ourselves from the cares and aspirations of mankind; - Seek a world of diversity and peaceful change, where men can choose their own governments and where each nation can determine its own destiny with external interference; - Resist the temptation to try to mold the world, or any part of it, in our own image, or to become the self-appointed policeman of the world; - Call on other nations, great and small, to contribute a fair share of effort and resources to world peace and development; - Honor our treaty obligations to our allies; - Seek always to strengthen and improve the United Nations and other international peacekeeping arrangements and meet breaches or threatened breaches of the peace according to our carefully assessed interests and resources; In pursuing these objectives, we will insure that our policies will be subject to constant review so they reflect our true national interests in a changing world. National Defense. The tragic events in Czechoslovakia are a shocking reminder that we live in a dangerous and unpredictable world. The Soviet attack on and invasion of a small country that only yesterday was Moscow's peaceful ally, is an ominous reversal of the slow trend toward greater freedom and independence in Eastern Europe. The reimposition of Soviet tyranny raises the spectre of the darkest days of the Stalin era and increases the risk of war in Central Europe, a war that could become a nuclear holocaust. Against this somber backdrop, whose full portent cannot now be seen, other recent Soviet military moves take on even greater significance. While we have a significant lead in military strength and in all vital areas of military technology, Moscow has steadily increased its strategic nuclear arsenal, its missile-firing nuclear submarine fleet, and its anti-missile defenses. Communist China is providing political and military support for so-called wars of national liberation. A growing nuclear power, Peking has disdained all arms control efforts. We must and will maintain a strong and balanced defense establishment adequate to the task of security and peace. There must be no doubt about our strategic nuclear capability, our capacity to meet limited challenges, and our willingness to act when our vital interests are threatened. To this end, we pledge a vigorous research and development effort. We will also continue to pursue the highly successful efforts initiated by Democratic administrations to save tax dollars by eliminating waste and duplication. We face difficult and trying times in Asia and in Europe. We have responsibilities and commitments we cannot escape with honor. But we are not alone. We have friends and allies around the world. We will consult with them and ask them to accept a fair share of the burdens of peace and security. North Atlantic Community. The North Atlantic Community is strong and free. We must further strengthen our ties and be constantly alert to new challenges and opportunities. We support a substantially larger European contribution to NATO. Soviet troops have never stepped across the border of a NATO country. By harassment and threat the Kremlin has repeatedly attempted to push the West out of Berlin. But West Berlin is still free. Western Europe is still free. This is a living tribute to the strength and validity of the NATO alliance. The political differences we have had with some of our allies from time to time should not divert us from our common task of building a secure and prosperous Atlantic community based on the principles of mutual respect and mutual dependence. The NATO alliance has demonstrated that free nations can build a common shield without sacrificing their identity and independence. Arms Control. We must recognize that vigilance calls for the twin disciplines of defense and arms control. Defense measures and arms control measures must go hand in-hand, each serving national security and the larger interests of peace. We must also recognize that the Soviet Union and the United States still have a common interest in avoiding nuclear war and preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. We also share a common interest in reducing the cost of National defense. We must continue to work together. We will press' for further arms control agreements, insisting on effective safeguards against violations. For almost a quarter of a century America's pre-eminent military strength, combined with our political restraints has deterred nuclear war. This great accomplishment has confounded the prophets of doom. Eight years ago the Democratic Party pledged new efforts to control nuclear weapons. We have fulfilled that pledge. The new Arms Control and Disarmament Agency has undertaken and coordinated important research. The sustained initiatives of President Kennedy and President Johnson have resulted in the ""hot line"" between the White House and the Kremlin, the limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the treaty barring the orbiting of weapons of mass destruction. Even in the present tense atmosphere, we strongly support President Johnson's effort to secure an agreement with the Soviet Union under which both states would refrain from deploying anti-missile systems. Such a treaty would result in the saving of billions of dollars and would create a climate for further arms control measures. We support concurrent efforts to freeze the present level of strategic weapons and delivery systems, and to achieve a balanced and verified reduction of all nuclear and conventional arms. The Middle East. The Middle East remains a powder keg. We must do all in our power to prevent a recurrence of war in this area. A large Soviet fleet has been deployed to the Mediterranean. Preferring short-term political advantage to long-range stability and peace, the Soviet Union has rushed arms to certain Arab states to replace those lost in the Arab-Israeli War of 1967. As long as Israel is threatened by hostile and well-armed neighbors, we will assist her with essential military equipment needed for her defense, including the most advanced types of combat aircraft. Lasting peace in the Middle East depends upon agreed and secured frontiers, respect for the territorial integrity of all States, the guaranteed right of innocent passage through all international waterways, a humane resettlement of the Arab refugees, and the establishment of a non-provocative military balance. To achieve these objectives, we support negotiations among the concerned parties. We strongly support efforts to achieve an agreement among states in the area and those states supplying arms to limit the flow of military equipment to the Middle East. We support efforts to raise the living standards throughout the area, including desalinization and regional irrigation projects which cut across state frontiers. Vietnam and Asia. Our most urgent task in Southeast Asia is to end the war in Vietnam by an honorable and lasting settlement which respects the rights of all the people of Vietnam. In our pursuit of peace and stability in the vital area of Southeast Asia we have borne a heavy burden in helping South Vietnam to counter aggression and subversion from the North. We reject as unacceptable a unilateral withdrawal of our forces which would allow that aggression and subversion to succeed. We have never demanded, and do not now demand, unconditional surrender by the Communists. We strongly support the Paris talks and applaud the initiative of President Johnson which brought North Vietnam to the peace table. We hope that Hanoi will respond positively to this act of statesmanship. In the quest for peace no solutions are free of risk. But calculated risks are consistent with the responsibility of a great nation to seek a peace of reconciliation. Recognizing that events in Vietnam and the negotiations in Paris may affect the timing and the actions we recommend we would support our Government in the following steps: Bombing - Stop all bombing of North Vietnam when this action would not endanger the lives of our troops in the field; this action should take into account the response from Hanoi. Troop Withdrawal - Negotiate with Hanoi an immediate end or limitation of hostilities and the withdrawal from South Vietnam of all foreign forces - both United States and allied forces, and forces infiltrated from North Vietnam. Election of Postwar Government - Encourage all parties and interests to agree that the choice of the postwar government of South Vietnam should be determined by fair and safeguarded elections, open to all major political factions and parties prepared to accept peaceful political processes. We would favor an effective international presence to facilitate the transition from war to peace and to assure the protection of minorities against reprisal. Interim Defense and Development Measures - Until the fighting stops, accelerate our efforts to train and equip the South Vietnamese army so that it can defend its own country and carry out cutbacks of U.S. military involvement as the South Vietnamese forces are able to take over their larger responsibilities. We should simultaneously do all in our power to support and encourage further economic, political and social development and reform in South Vietnam, including an extensive land reform program. We support President Johnson's repeated offer to provide a substantial U.S. contribution to the post-war reconstruction of South Vietnam as well as to the economic development of the entire region, including North Vietnam. Japan and the European industrial states should be urged to join in this post-war effort. For the future, we will make it clear that U.S. military and economic assistance in Asia will be selective. In addition to considerations of our vital interests and our resources, we will take into account the determination of the nations that request our help to help themselves and their willingness to help each other through regional and multilateral cooperation. We want no bases in South Vietnam; no continued military presence and no political role in Vietnamese affairs. If and when the Communists understand our basic commitment and limited goals and are willing to take their chances, as we are, on letting the choice of the post-war government of South Vietnam be determined freely and peacefully by all of the South Vietnamese people, then the bloodshed and the tragedy can stop. Japan, India, Indonesia, and most of the smaller Asian nations are understandably apprehensive about Red China because of its nuclear weapons, its support of subversive efforts abroad, and its militant rhetoric. They have been appalled by the barbaric behavior of the Red Guards toward the Chinese people, their callous disregard for human life and their mistreatment of foreign diplomats. The immediate prospects that China will emerge from its self-imposed isolation are dim. But both Asians and Americans will have to coexist with the 750 million Chinese on the mainland. We shall continue to make it clear that we are prepared to cooperate with China whenever it is ready to become a responsible member of the international community. We would actively encourage economic, social and cultural exchange with mainland China as a means of freeing that nation and her people from their narrow isolation. We support continued assistance to help maintain the independence and peaceful development of India and Pakistan. Recognizing the growing importance of Asia and the Pacific, we will encourage increased cultural and educational efforts, such as those undertaken in multi-racial Hawaii, to facilitate a better understanding of the problems and opportunities of this vast area. The Developing World. The American people share the aspirations for a better life in the developing world. But we are committed to peaceful change. We believe basic political rights in most states can be more effectively achieved and maintained by peaceful action than by violence. In their struggle for political and economic development, most Asian, African, and Latin American states are confronted by grinding poverty, illiteracy and a stubborn resistance to constructive change. The aspirations and frustrations of the people are frequently exploited by self-serving revolutionaries who employ illegal and violent means. Since World War II, America's unprecedented program of foreign economic assistance for reconstruction and development has made a profound contribution to peace, security, and a better life for millions of people everywhere. Many nations formerly dependent upon American aid are now viable and stable as a result of this aid. We support strengthened U.S. and U.N. development aid programs that are responsive to changing circumstances and based on the recognition, as President Johnson put it, that ""self-help is the lifeblood of economic development."" Grant aid and government loans for long-term projects are part of a larger transfer of resources between the developed and underdeveloped states, which includes international trade and private capital investment as important components. Like the burden of keeping the peace, the responsibility for assisting the developing world must be shared by Japan and the Western European states, once recipients of U.S. aid and now donor states. Development aid should be coordinated among both donors and recipients. The World Bank and other international and regional agencies for investment and development should be fully utilized. We should encourage regional cooperation by the recipients for the most efficient use of resources and markets. We should press for additional international agreements that will stimulate mutually beneficial trade and encourage a growing volume of private investment in the developing states. World-wide commodity agreements that stabilize prices for particular products and other devices to stabilize export earnings will also spur development. "" We believe priority attention should be given to agricultural production and population control. Technical assistance which emphasizes manpower training is also of paramount importance. We support the Peace Corps which has sent thousands of ambassadors of good will to three continents. Cultural and historic ties and a common quest for peace with freedom and justice have made Latin America an area of special concern and interest to the United States. We support a vigorous Alliance for Progress program based upon the Charter of Punta del Este which affirms that ""free men working through the institutions for representative democracy can best satisfy man's aspirations."" We support the objective of Latin American economic integration endorsed by the presidents of the American Republics in April 1967, and urge further efforts in the areas of tax reform, land reform, educational reform, and economic development to fulfill the promise of Punta del Este. United Nations. Since the birth of the United Nations, the United States has pursued the quest for peace, security and human dignity through United Nations channels more vigorously than any other member state. Our dedication to its purpose and its work remains undiminished. The United Nations contributed to dampening the fires of conflict in Kashmir, the Middle East, Cyprus and the Congo. The agencies of the United Nations have made a significant contribution to health, education and economic well-being in Asia, Africa and Latin America. These efforts deserve continued and expanded support. We pledge that support. Since we recognize that the United Nations can be only as effective as the support of its members, we call upon other states to join with us in a renewed commitment to use its facilities in the great tasks of economic development, the nonmilitary use of atomic energy, arms control and peacekeeping. It is only with member nations working together that the organization can make its full contribution to the growth of a world community of peace under law, rather than by threat or use of military force. We are profoundly concerned about the continued repression of Jews and other minorities in the Soviet Union and elsewhere, and look forward to the day when the full light of liberty and freedom shall be extended to all countries and all peoples. Foreign Trade and Financial Policy. World trade is essential to economic stability. The growing interdependence of nations, particularly in economic affairs, is an established fact of contemporary life. It also spells an opportunity for constructive international cooperation that will bring greater well-being for all and improve the prospects for international peace and security. We shall build upon the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and the Kennedy round of trade negotiations, in order to achieve greater trade cooperation and progress toward freer international trade. In future negotiations, which will require careful preparation, we shall: 1) seek continued reciprocal reduction and elimination of tariff barriers, based on the most favored nation principle; 2) negotiate the reciprocal removal of nontariff barriers to international trade on all products, including agriculture; 3) give special attention to the needs of the developing countries for increased export earnings; and 4) develop and improve the rules governing fair international competition affecting both foreign commerce and investment. To lessen the hardships suffered by industries and workers as the result of trade liberalization, we support improvements in the adjustment assistance provisions of present law. Provision of law to remedy unfair and destructive import competition should be reviewed and strengthened, and negotiated international agreements to achieve this purpose should be employed where appropriate. The United States has experienced balance-of-payments deficits for over a decade, mainly because of our security obligations to the free world. Faced with these deficits, we have behaved responsibly by avoiding both economic deflation at home and severe and unilateral restrictive measures on international transactions, which would have weakened the international economy and international cooperation. Faced with these deficits, we have behaved responsibly by avoiding both economic deflation at home and severe and unilateral restrictive measures on international transactions, which would have weakened the international economy and international cooperation. We shall continue to take the path of constructive measures by relying on steps to increase our exports and by the development of further cooperative arrangements with the other countries. We intend, as soon as possible, to dismantle the restrictions placed on foreign investment and finance, so that American free enterprise can play its full part as the agent of economic development. We will continue to encourage persons from other lands to visit America. Steps of historical importance have already been taken to improve the functioning of the international monetary system, most notably the new special drawing rights under the international monetary fund. We shall continue to work for the further improvement of the international monetary system so as to reduce its vulnerability to monetary crises. ECONOMIC GROWTH AND STABILITY The Democratic policies that more than doubled the nation's rate of economic expansion in the past eight years can double and redouble our national income by the end of this century. Such a rate of economic growth will enable us to win total victory in our wars on ignorance, poverty, and the misery of the ghettos. But victory will not come automatically. To realize our full economic potential will require effective, businesslike planning and cooperation between government and all elements of private economy. The Democratic Party pledges itself to achieve that purpose in many ways. Fiscal and Monetary Policy. Taxes were lowered in 1962, 1964, and 1965 to encourage more private spending and reach full employment, they were raised in 1966 and 1968 to help prevent inflation, but with a net reduction in the eight Democratic years. We will continue to use tax policy to maintain steady economic growth by helping through tax reduction to stimulate the economy when it is sluggish and through temporary tax increases to restrain inflation. To promote this objective, methods must be devised to permit prompt, temporary changes in tax rates within prescribed limits with full participation of the Congress in the decisions. The goals of our national tax policy must be to distribute the burden of government equitably among our citizens and to promote economic efficiency and stability. We have placed major reliance on progressive taxes, which are based on the democratic principle of ability to pay. We pledge ourselves to continue to rely on such taxes, and to continue to improve the way they are levied and collected so that every American contributes to government in proportion to his ability to pay. A thorough revamping of our federal taxes has been long overdue to make them more equitable as between rich and poor and as among people with the same income and family responsibilities. All corporation and individual preferences that do not serve the national interest should be removed. Tax preferences, like expenditures, must be rigorously evaluated to assure that the benefit to the nation is worth the cost. We support a proposal for a minimum income tax for persons of high income based on an individual's total income regardless of source, in order that wealthy persons will be required to make some kind of income tax contribution, no matter how many tax shelters they use to protect their incomes. We also support a reduction of the tax burden on the poor by lowering the income tax rates at the bottom of the tax scale and increasing the minimum standard deduction. No person or family below the poverty level should be required to pay federal income taxes. Our goal is a balanced budget in a balanced economy. We favor distinguishing current operating expenditures from long-term capital outlays and repayable loans, which should be amortized consistent with sound accounting principles. All government expenditures should be subject to firm tests of efficiency and essentiality. An effective policy for growth and stability requires careful coordination of fiscal and monetary policies. Changes in taxes, budgets, interest rates, and money supply must be carefully blended and flexibly adjusted to assure: - Adaptation to changing economic conditions; - Adequate supplies of money and credit for the expansion of industry, commerce, and housing; - Maintenance of the lowest possible interest rates; - Avoidance of needless hardships on groups that depend heavily on credit. Cooperation between fiscal and monetary authorities was greatly strengthened in the past eight years, and we pledge ourselves to continue to perfect this cooperation. Price Stability With Growth. Price stability continues to be an essential goal of expansive economic policy. Price inflation hurts most the weak among us and could interfere with the continued personal gains we are determined to achieve in the immediate years ahead. The answer to rising prices will never be sought, under Democratic administrations, in unemployment and idle plant facilities. We are firmly committed to the twin objectives of full employment and price stability. To promote price stability in a dynamic and growing economy, we will: Pursue flexible fiscal and monetary policies designed to keep total private and public demand in line with the economy's steadily rising productive capacity. Work effectively with business, labor, and the public in formulating principles for price and wage policies that are equitable and sound for consumers as well as for workers and investors. Strictly enforce antitrust and trade practice laws to combat administered pricing, supply limitations and other restrictive practices. Strengthen competition by keeping the doors of world trade open and resisting the protectionism of captive markets. Stimulate plant modernization, upgrade labor skills, and speed technological advance to step up productivity. Agriculture. Twice in this century the Republican Party has brought disaster to the American farmer - in the thirties and in the fifties. Each time the American farmer was rescued by the Democratic Party, but his prosperity has not yet been fully restored Farmers must continue to be heard in the councils of government where decisions affecting agriculture are taken. The productivity of our farmers - already the world's most productive - must continue to rise, making American agriculture more competitive abroad and more prosperous at home. A strong agriculture requires fair income to farmers for an expanding output. Family farmers must be protected from the squeeze between rising production costs and low prices for their products Farm income should grow with productivity just as industrial wages rise with productivity. At the same time, market prices should continue to reflect supply and demand conditions and American farm products must continue to compete effectively m world markets. In this way, markets at home and abroad will continue to expand beyond the record high levels of recent years. To these ends, we shall: Take positive action to raise farm income to full parity level in order to preserve the efficient, full-time family farm. This can be done through present farm programs when these programs are properly funded, but these programs will be constantly scrutinized with a view to improvement. Actively seek out and develop foreign commercial markets, since international trade in agricultural products is a major favorable factor in the nation's balance of payments. In expanding our trade, we shall strive to ensure that farmers get adequate compensation for their production going into export. Expand our food assistance programs to America's poor and our Food for Peace program to help feed the world's hungry. Establish a Strategic Food and Feed Reserve Plan whereby essential commodities such as wheat, corn and other feed grains, soybeans, storable meat and other products will be stockpiled as a safeguard against crop failures, to assist our nation and other nations in time of famine or disaster, and to ensure adequate supplies for export markets, as well as to protect our own farm industry. This reserve should be insulated from the market. Support the right of farmers to bargain collectively in the market place on a commodity-by-commodity basis. Labor and industry have long enjoyed this right to bargain collectively under existing legislation. Protective legislation for bargaining should be extended to agriculture. Continue to support and encourage agricultural co-operatives by expanded and liberal credit, and to protect them from punitive taxation. Support private or public credit on reasonable terms to young farmers to enable them to purchase farms on long-term, low-interest loans. Support the federal crop insurance program. Reaffirm our support of the rural electrification program, recognizing that rural America cannot be revitalized without adequate low-cost electric power. We pledge continued support of programs to assure supplemental financing to meet the growing generating and distributing power needs of rural areas. We support the rural telephone program. Support a thorough study of the effect of unlimited payments to farmers. If necessary, we suggest graduated open-end limitations of payments to extremely large corporate farms that participate in government programs. Take a positive approach to the public interest in the issue of health and tobacco at all levels of the tobacco economy. We recommend a cooperative effort in health and tobacco research by government, industry and qualified scientific bodies, to ascertain relationships between human health and tobacco growth, curing, storage and manufacturing techniques, as well as specific medical aspects of tobacco smoke constituents. Small Business. Small business plays a vital role in a dynamic, competitive economy; it helps maintain a strong social fabric in communities across the land; it builds concerned community leadership deriving from ownership of small enterprises and it maintains the challenge and competition essential to a free enterprise system. To assure a continuing healthy environment for small business, the Democratic Party pledges to: Assure adequate credit at reasonable costs; Assure small business a fair share of government contracts and procurement; Encourage investment in research and development of special benefit to small enterprise; Assist small business in taking advantage of technological innovations Provide centers of information on government procurement needs and foreign sales opportunities. The Democratic Party is pledged to develop programs that will enable members of minority groups to obtain the financing and technical management assistance needed to succeed in launching and operating new enterprises. Labor-Management Relations. Private collective bargaining and a strong and independent labor movement are essential to our system of free enterprise and economic democracy. Their development has been fostered under each Democratic administration in this century. We will thoroughly review and update the National Labor Relations Act to assure an effective opportunity to all workers to exercise the right to organize and to bargain collectively, including such amendments as: Repeal of the provision permitting states to enact compulsory open shop laws; Extension of the Act's protection to farm workers, employees of private non-profit organizations, and other employees not now covered; Removal of unreasonable restrictions upon the right of peaceful picketing, including situs picketing; Speedier decisions in unfair labor practice cases and representation proceedings; Greater equality between the remedies available under the Act to labor and those available to management; Effective opportunities for unions as well as employers to communicate with employees, without coercion by either side or by anyone acting in their behalf. The Federal Government will continue to set an example as an employer to private business and to state and local governments. The Government will not do business with firms that repeatedly violate Federal statutes prohibiting discrimination against employees who are union members or refuse to bargain with duly authorized union representatives. By all these means, we will sustain the right of workers to organize in unions of their own choosing and will foster truly effective collective bargaining to provide the maximum opportunity for just and fair agreements between management and labor. Consumer Protection. Rising incomes have brought new vigor to the market place. But the march of technology which has brought unparalleled abundance and opportunity to the consumer has also exposed him to new hazards and new complexities. In providing economic justice for consumers, we shall strengthen business and industry and improve the quality of life for all 200 million Americans. We commend the Democratic Congress for passing the landmark legislation of the past several years which has ushered in a l new era of consumer protection - truth-in-lending, truth-in-packaging, wholesome meat and poultry, auto and highway safety, child safety, and protection against interstate land swindles. We shall take steps, including necessary legislation, to minimize the likelihood of massive electric power failures, to improve the safety of medical devices and drugs, to penalize deceptive sales practices, and to provide consumer access to product information now being compiled in the Federal Government. We will help the states to establish consumer fraud and information bureaus, and to update consumer credit laws. A major objective of all consumer programs, at all levels, must be the education of the buying public, particularly the poor who are the special targets of unscrupulous and high-pressure salesmanship. We will make the consumer's voice increasingly heard in the councils of government. We will strengthen consumer education and enforcement programs by consolidation of functions now dispersed among various agencies, through the establishment of an Office of Consumer Affairs to represent consumer interests within the government and before courts and regulatory agencies. Housing. For the first time in history, a nation is able to rebuild or replace all of its substandard housing, even while providing housing for millions of new families. This means rebuilding or replacing 4.5 million dwelling units in our urban areas and 3.9 million in rural areas, most in conditions of such dilapidation that they are too often dens of despair for millions of Americans. Yet this performance is possible in the next decade because of goals and programs fashioned by Democratic Presidents and Democratic Congresses in close partnership with private business. The goal is clear and pressing - ""a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family,"" as set forth in the 1949 Housing Act by a Democratic Congress and Administration. To achieve this goal in the next ten years: We will assist private enterprise to double its volume of homebuilding, to an annual rate of 2.6 million units a year - a ten-year total of 26 million units. This is the specific target of the history-making Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968. We will give the highest priority to Federally assisted homebuilding for low-income families, with special attention given to ghetto dwellers, the elderly, the physically handicapped, and families in neglected areas of rural America, Indian reservations, territories of the United States and migratory worker camps. All federal subsidy programs - whether in the form of public housing, interest rates at 1%, rent supplements, or direct loans - will be administered to favor these disadvantaged families, with full participation by neighborhood residents themselves. We will cooperate with private home builders to experiment boldly with new production technology, with financial institutions to marshall capital for housing where it is most needed, and with unions to expand the labor force needed for a doubling of production. Above all, we will work toward the greatest possible freedom of choice - the opportunity for every family, regardless of race, color, religion, or income, to choose home ownership or rental, high-rise or low-rise, cooperatives or condominiums, detached or town house, and city, suburban or country living. We urge local governments to shape their own zoning laws and building codes to favor consumers and bold down costs. Rigid enforcement of State and local health and building codes is imperative to alleviate conditions of squalor and despair in deteriorating neighborhoods. Democrats are proud of their housing record. But we are also painfully aware of how much more needs to be done to reach the final goal of decent shelter for all Americans and we pledge a steadfast pursuit of that goal. Transportation. America is a nation on the move. To meet the challenge of transportation, we propose a dynamic partnership between industry and government at all levels. Of utmost urgency is the need to solve congestion in air traffic, especially in airports and between major metropolitan centers. We pledge intensified efforts to devise equitable methods of financing new and improved airport and airway facilities. Urban and inter-urban transportation facilities are heavily overburdened. We support expanded programs of assistance to mass transit in order to avoid unnecessary congestion in air traffic, especially at air link residential and work areas. Despite the tremendous progress of our interstate highway program, still more super-highways are needed for safe and rapid motor transport. We need to establish local road networks to meet regional requirements. The efficiency of our railroads has improved greatly but there is need for further strengthening of the nation's railroads so that they can contribute more fully to the nation's transport requirements. In particular, we will press forward with the effort to develop high-speed passenger trains to serve major urban areas. To assume our proper place as a leading maritime nations we must launch an aggressive and balanced program to replace: and augment our obsolete merchant ships with modem vessels; built in American shipyards. We will assist U.S. flag operators to overcome the competitive disparity between American and foreign costs. We will continue to foster development of harbors, ports, and inland waterways, particularly regional waterways systems, and the St. Lawrence Seaway, to accommodate our expanded water-borne commerce. We support modernization of the Panama Canal. We pledge a greater investment in transportation research and development to enhance safety and increase speed and economy; to implement the acts that have been passed to control noxious vehicle exhausts, and to reduce aircraft noise. The expansion of our transportation must not be carried out at the expense of the environment through which it moves. We applaud the leadership provided by the First Lady to enhance the highway environment and initiate a national beautification program Communications. America has the most efficient and comprehensive communications system in the world. But a healthy Society depends more on the quality of what is communicated than either the volume or form of communication. Public broadcasting has already proven that it can be a valuable supplement to formal education and a direct medium for non-formal education. We pledge our continuing support for the prompt enactment of a long-range financing plan that will help ensure the vigor and independence of this potentially vital but still underdeveloped new force in American life. We deplore the all too frequent exploitation of violence as entertainment in all media. In 1962 the Democratic Party sensed the great potential of space communication and quickly translated this awareness into the Communications Satellite Act. In a creative partnership between government and business, this revolutionary idea soon became a reality. Six years later we helped establish a consortium of 61 nations devoted to the development of a global satellite network. We will continue to develop new technology and utilize communications to promote world-wide understanding as an essential pre-condition of world peace. But, in view of rapidly changing technology, the entire federal regulatory system dealing with telecommunication should be thoroughly reappraised. Science and Technology. We lead the world in science and technology. This has produced a dramatic effect on the daily lives of all of us. To maintain our undisputed national leadership in science and further its manifold applications for the betterment of mankind, the Federal Government has a clear obligation to foster and support creative men and women in the research community, both public and private. Our pioneering space program has helped mankind on earth in countless ways. The benefits from improved weather forecasting which can soon be available thanks to satellite observations and communications will by themselves make the space efforts worthwhile. Observation by satellite of crops and other major earth resources will for the first time enable man to see all that is available to him on earth, and therefore to take maximum advantage of it. High-endurance metals developed for spacecraft help make commercial planes safer; similarly, micro-electronics are now found in consumer appliances. Novel space food-preservation techniques are employed in the tropical climates of underdeveloped countries. We will move ahead in aerospace research and development for their unimagined promise for man on earth as well as their vital importance to national defense. We shall continue to work for our goal of leadership in space. To this end we will maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of our space programs through utilization of the best program, planning and budgeting systems. To maintain our leadership in the application of energy, we will push forward with research and development to assure a balanced program for the supply of energy for electric power both public and private. This effort should go hand in hand with the development of ""breeder"" reactors and large-scale nuclear desalting plants that can provide pure water economically from the sea for domestic use and agricultural and industrial development in arid regions, and with broadened medical and biological applications of atomic energy. In addition to the physical sciences, the social sciences will be encouraged and assisted to identify and deal with the problem areas of society. OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL We of the Democratic Party believe that a nation wealthy beyond the dreams of most of mankind - a nation with a twentieth of the world's population, possessing half the world's manufactured goods - has the capacity and the duty to assure to all its citizens the opportunity to enjoy the full measure of the blessings of American life. For the first time in the history of the world, it is within the power of a nation to eradicate from within its borders the age-old curse of poverty. Our generation of Americans has now made those commitments. It remains to implement and adequately fund the host of practical measures that demonstrate their effectiveness and to continue to devise new approaches. We are guided by the recommendations of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders concerning jobs, housing urban renewal, and education on a scale commensurate with the needs of the urban ghettos. We are guided by the report of the Commission on Rural Poverty in tackling the equally compelling problems of the rural slums. Economic growth is our first antipoverty program. The best avenue to an independent, confident citizenry is a dynamic, full employment economy. Beyond that lie the measures necessary to assure that every American, of every race, in every region, truly shares in the benefits of economic progress. Those measures include rehabilitation of the victims of poverty, elimination of the urban and rural slums where poverty is bred, and changes throughout the system of institutions that affect the lives of the poor. In this endeavor, the resources of private enterprise - not only its economic power but its leadership and ingenuity - must be mobilized. We must marshal the power that comes from people working together in communities - the neighborhood communities of the poor and the larger communities of the city, the town, the village, the region. We support community action agencies and their programs, such as Head Start, that will prevent the children of the poor from becoming the poor of the next generation. We support the extension of neighborhood centers. We are committed to the principle of meaningful participation of the poor in policy-making and administration of community action and related programs. Since organizations of many kinds are joined in the war on poverty, problems of coordination inevitably arise. We pledge ourselves to review current antipoverty efforts to assess how responsibility should be distributed among levels of government, among private and public agencies, and between the permanent agencies of the Federal Government and an independent antipoverty agency. Toward a Single Society. We acknowledge with concern the findings of the report of the bi-partisan National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders and we commit ourselves to implement its recommendations and to wipe out, once and for all, the stain of racial and other discrimination from our national life. ""The major goal,"" the Commission wrote, ""is the creation of a true union - a single society and a single American identity."" A single society, however, does not mean social or cultural uniformity. We are a nation of many social, ethnic and national groups. Each has brought richness and strength to America. The Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, all adopted under the vigorous leadership of President Johnson, are basic to America's long march toward full equality under the law. We will not permit these great gains to be chipped away by opponents or eroded by administrative neglect. We pledge effective and impartial enforcement of these laws. If they prove inadequate, or if their compliance provisions fail to serve their purposes, we will propose new laws. In particular, the enforcement provisions of the legislation prohibiting discrimination in employment should be strengthened. This will be done as a matter of first priority. We have also come to recognize that freedom and equality require more than the ending of repression and prejudice. The victims of past discrimination must be encouraged and assisted to take full advantage of opportunities that are now opening to them. We must recognize that for too long we have neglected the abilities and aspirations of Spanish-speaking Americans to participate fully in American life. We promise to fund and implement the Bilingual Education Act and expand recruitment and training of bilingual federal and state employees. The American Indian has the oldest claim on our national conscience. We must continue and increase federal help in the Indian's battle against poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, ill health and poor housing. To this end, we pledge a new and equal federal-Indian partnership that will enable Indian communities to provide for themselves many services now furnished by the federal government and federal sponsorship of industrial development programs owned, managed and run by Indians. We support a quick and fair settlement of land claims of Indians, Eskimo and Aleut citizens of Alaska. The Inner City. In the decaying slums of our larger cities, where so many of our poor are concentrated, the attack on poverty must embrace many interrelated aspects of development - economic development, the rehabilitation or replacement of dilapidated and unsafe housing, job training and placement, and the improvement of education, health, recreation, crime control welfare, and other public services. As the framework of such an effort, we will continue to support the Model Cities program under which communities themselves are planning and carrying out the most comprehensive plans ever put together for converting their worst slum areas into model neighborhoods - with full participation and leadership by the neighborhood residents themselves. The Model Cities program will be steadily extended to more cities and more neighborhoods and adequately financed. The resources and leadership of private enterprise must be marshalled in the attack on slums and poverty, and such incentives as may be essential for that purpose we will develop and enact. Some of the most urgent jobs in the revival of the inner city remain undone because the hazards are too great and the rewards too limited to attract sufficient private capital. To meet this problem, we will charter a new federal banking structure to provide capital and investment guarantees for urban projects planned and implemented through local initiative - neighborhood development corporations, minority programs for self-employment, housing development corporations, and other urban construction and planning operations. We will also enact legislation providing tax incentives for new business and industrial enterprises in the inner city. Our experience with aid to small business demonstrates the importance of increased local ownership of business enterprises in the inner city. We shall aid the universities to concentrate their resources more fully upon the problems of the cities and facilitate their cooperation with municipal agencies and local organizations in finding solutions to urban problems. Rural Development. Balanced growth is essential for America. To achieve that balanced growth, we must greatly increase the growth of the rural non-farm economy. One-third of our people live in rural areas, but only one rural family in ten derives its principal income from farming. Almost thirty percent of the nation's poor are non-farm people in rural areas. The problem of rural poverty and the problem of migration of poor people from rural areas to urban ghettos are mainly nonfarm problems. The creation of productive jobs in small cities and towns can be the best and least costly solution of these problems. To revitalize rural and small-town America and assure equal opportunity for all Americans wherever they live, we pledge to: Create jobs by offering inducements to new enterprises - using tax and other incentives - to locate in small towns and rural areas; Administer existing federal programs and design new programs where necessary to overcome the disparity between rural and urban areas in opportunities for education, for health services, for low income housing, for employment and job training, and for public services of all kinds; Encourage the development of new towns and new growth centers; Encourage the creation of comprehensive planning and development agencies to provide additional leadership in non-metropolitan areas, and assist them financially. The experience of the Appalachian and other regional commissions indicates that municipalities, counties, and state and federal agencies can work together in a common development effort. Jobs and Training. Every American in need of work should have opportunity not only for meaningful employment, but also for the education, training, counselling, and other services that enable him to take advantage of available jobs. To the maximum possible extent, our national goal of full employment should be realized through creation of jobs in the private economy, where six of every seven Americans now work. We will continue the Job Opportunities in the Business Sector (JOBS) program, which for the first time has mobilized the energies of business and industry on a nationwide scale to provide training and employment to the hardcore unemployed. We will develop whatever additional incentives may be necessary to maximize the opportunities in the private sector for hardcore unemployed. We will continue also to finance the operation by local communities of a wide range of training programs for youth and retraining for older workers whose skills have become obsolete coupled with related services necessary to enable people to undertake training and accept jobs - including improved recruitment and placement services, day-care centers, and transportation between work and home. For those who can work but cannot find jobs, we pledge to expand public job and job-training programs, including the Neighborhood Youth Corps, to provide meaningful employment in state and local government and nonprofit institutions. For those who cannot obtain other employment, the federal government will be the employer of last resort, either through federal assistance to state and local projects or through federally sponsored projects. Employment Standards. American workers are entitled to more than the right to a job. They have the right to fair and safe working conditions and to adequate protection in periods of unemployment or disability. In the last thirty years Democratic administrations and Congresses have enacted, extended and improved a series of measures to provide safeguards against exploitation and distress. We pledge to continue these efforts. The minimum standards covering terms and conditions of employment must be improved: By increasing the minimum wage guarantee to assure those at the bottom the economic scale a fairer share in rising living standards; By extending the minimum wage and overtime provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act to all workers; By enacting occupational health and safety legislation to assure the material reduction of the present occupational death rate of 14,500 men and women each year, and the disabling accident rate of over 2 million per year; By assuring that the ""green card"" worker does not depress wages and conditions of employment for American workers; By updating of the benefit provisions of the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Act. The unemployment compensation program should be modernized by national minimum standards for level and duration of benefits, eligibility, and universal coverage. Older Citizens. A lifetime of work and effort deserves a secure and satisfying retirement. Benefits, especially minimum benefits, under Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance, should be raised to overcome present inadequacies and thereafter should be adjusted automatically to reflect increases in living costs. Medical care for the aged should be expanded to include the costs of prescription drugs. The minimum age for public assistance should be lowered to correspond to the requirements for social security. America's self-employed citizens should be encouraged by tax incentive legislation to supplement social security benefits for themselves and their employees to the same extent that employees of corporations are encouraged. In addition to improving social security, we must develop in each community a wide variety of activities to enrich the lives of our older citizens, to enable them to continue to contribute to our society and to permit them to live in dignity. The aged must have access to better housing, opportunities for regular or part-time employment and community volunteer service, and cultural and recreational activities. People in Need. Every American family whose income is not sufficient to enable its members to live in decency should receive assistance free of the indignities and uncertainties that still too often mar our present programs. To support family incomes of the working poor a number of new program proposals have recently been developed. A thorough evaluation of the relative advantages of such proposals deserves the highest priority attention by the next Administration. This we pledge to do. Income payments and eligibility standards for the aged, the blind, the disabled and dependent children should be determined and financed on a federal basis - in place of the present inequitable, under-financed hodge-podge state plans. This would, among other things, assure the eligibility in all states of needy children of unemployed parents who are now denied assistance in more than half the states as long as the father remains in the home. Assistance payments should not only be brought to adequate levels but they should be kept adequate by providing for automatic adjustment to reflect increases in living costs. Congress has temporarily suspended the restrictive amendment of 1967 that placed an arbitrary limit on the number of dependent children who can be aided in each state. We favor permanent repeal of that restriction and of the provision requiring mothers of young children to work. The new federal-state program we propose should provide for financial incentives and needed services to enable and encourage adults on welfare to seek employment to the extent they are able to do so. The time has come when we should make a national commitment that no American should have to go hungry or undernourished. The Democratic Party here and now does make that commitment. We will move rapidly to implement it through continued improvement and expansion of our food programs. The Democratic Congress this year has already enacted legislation to expand and improve the school lunch and commodity distribution programs, and shortly will complete action on legislation now pending to expand the food stamp program. We will enact further legislation and appropriations to assure on a permanent basis that the school lunch program provides free and reduced-price meals to all needy school children. Health. The best of modern medical care should be made available to every American. We support efforts to overcome the remaining barriers of distance, poverty, ignorance, and discrimination that separate persons from adequate medical services. During the last eight years of Democratic administrations this nation has taken giant steps forward in assuring life and health for its citizens. In the years ahead, we Democrats are determined to take those final steps that are necessary to make certain that every American, regardless of economic status, shall live out his years without fear of the high costs of sickness. Through a partnership of government and private enterprise we must develop new coordinated approaches to stem the rise in medical and drug costs without lowering the quality or availability of medical care. Out-of-hospital care, comprehensive group practice arrangements increased availability of neighborhood health centers, and the greater use of sub-professional aides can a contribute to the lowering of medical costs. We will raise the level of research in all fields of health with special programs for development of the artificial heart and heart transplant technique, development of drugs to prevent the recurrence of heart diseases, expansion of current task forces in cancer research and the creation of new ones including cancer of the lung, determination of the factors in mental retardation and reduction of infant mortality, development of drugs to reduce the incidence of suicide and construction of health research facilities and hospitals. We must build new medical, dental and medical service schools, and increase the capacity of existing ones, to train more doctors, dentists, nurses and medical technicians. Medical care should be extended to disabled beneficiaries under the Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance Act to the same extent and under the same system that such care is available to the aged. Thousands of children die, or are handicapped for life, because their mothers did not receive proper pre-natal medical attention or because the infants were unattended in the critical first days of life. Maternal and child health centers, located and designed to serve the needs of the poor, and voluntary family planning information centers should be established throughout the country. Medicaid programs administered by the states should have uniform standards so that no mother or child is denied necessary health services. Finally, we urge consideration of a program comparable to Medicare to finance prenatal care for mothers and post-natal care for children during the first year of life. Veterans. American veterans deserve our enduring gratitude for their distinguished service to the nation. In 1968 some 750,000 returning servicemen will continue their education with increased benefits under the new G.I. Bill passed by an education-minded Democratic Congress. Two million disabled veterans and survivors of those killed in action are receiving larger pensions and higher disability payments. Guided by the Report of the Veterans Advisory Commission, established by the Democratic administration, we will: - Continue a strong one-stop agency vested with sole responsibility for all veterans programs; - Sustain and upgrade veteran medical services and expand medical training in VA hospitals; - Maintain compensation for disabled veterans and for widows and dependents of veterans who die of service-connected causes, in line with the rise in earnings and living standards; - Assure every veteran the right of burial in a national cemetery; - Provide incentives for veterans to aid their communities by serving in police, fire departments, educational systems and other public endeavors. - Make veterans and their widows eligible for pension benefits at the same age at which Social Security beneficiaries may receive old age benefits. - We recommend the establishment of a standing Committee on Veterans Affairs in the Senate. Education. Education is the chief instrument for making good the American promise. It is indispensable to every man's chance to achieve his full potential. We will seek to open education to all Americans. We will assure equal opportunity to education and equal access to high-quality education. Our aim is to maintain state and local control over the nation's educational system, with federal financial assistance and help in stimulating changes through demonstration and technical assistance. New concepts of education and training employing new communications technology must be developed to educate children and adults. Every citizen has a basic right to as much education and training as he desires and can master - from preschool through graduate studies - even if his family cannot pay for this education. We will marshal our national resources to help develop and finance new and effective methods - of dealing with the educationally disadvantaged-including expanded preschool programs to prepare all young children for full participation in formal education, improved teacher recruitment and training programs for inner city and rural schools, the Teacher Corps, assistance to community controlled schools to encourage pursuit of innovative practices, university participation in research and operation of school programs, a vocational education system that will provide imaginative new ties between school and the world of work, and improved and more widespread adult education programs. We will fully fund Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, which provides federal funds for improving education in schools serving large numbers of students from low income families. The financial burden of education continues to grow as enrollments spiral and costs increase. The home owner's property tax burden must be eased by increased levels of financial aid by both the states and the Federal government. Our rapidly expanding educational frontiers require a redoubling of efforts to insure the vitality of a diverse higher education system - public and private, large and small, community and junior colleges, vocational and technical schools, and great universities. We also pledge support for high quality graduate and medical education. We will enlarge the federal scholarship program to remove the remaining financial barriers to post-secondary education for low income youths, and increase assistance to students in the form of repayable loans out of future income. We will encourage support for the arts and the humanities, through the national foundations established by a Democratic Congress to provide incentives for those endowed with extraordinary talent, enhance the quality of our life, and make productive leisure available to all our people. We recommend greater stress on the arts and humanities in elementary and secondary curricula to ensure a proper educational balance. Youth. For generations, the Democratic Party has renewed its vitality with young people and new ideas. Today, young people are bringing new vigor and a deep concern for social justice into the political process, yet many feel excluded from full participation. We of the Democratic Party welcome the bold thinking and exciting ideas of youth. We recognize, with deep satisfaction, that their healthy desire for participation in the democratic system must lead to a series of reforms in the direction of a greater democracy and a more open America. The Democratic Party takes pride in the fact that so many of today's youth have channeled their interests and energies into our Party. To them, and to all young Americans we pledge the fullest opportunity to participate in the affairs of our Party at the local, state, and national levels. We call for special efforts to recruit young people as candidates for public office. We will support a constitutional amendment lowering the voting age to 18. We favor an increase in youth representation on state delegations in future Democratic conventions. Steps should be taken to include youth advisors on all government studies, commissions, and hearings which are relevant to their lives. We will establish a youth commission involving young people between the ages of 18 and 26. Every young person should have an opportunity to contribute to the social health of his community or for humanitarian service abroad. The extraordinary experience of the Teacher Corps, VISTA, and the Peace Corps points the way for broadening the opportunities for such voluntary service. Hundreds of thousands of America's youth have sought to enlist in these programs, but only tens of thousands have been able to serve. We will expand these opportunities. The lives of millions of young men are deeply affected by the requirement for military service. The present system leaves them in uncertainty through much of their early manhood. Until our manpower needs can be fully met by voluntary enlistment, the Democratic Party will insist upon the most equitable and just selection system that can be devised. We support a random system of selection which will reduce the period of eligibility to one year, guarantee fair selection, and remove uncertainty. We urge review of draft board memberships to make them more representative of the communities they serve. ENVIRONMENT, CONSERVATION AND NATURAL RESOURCES These United States have undergone 200 years of continuous change and dramatic development resulting in the most technologically advanced nation in the World. But with rapid industrialization, the nation's air and water resources have been degraded, the public health and welfare endangered, the landscape scarred and littered, and the very quality of our national life jeopardized. We must assure the availability of a decent environment for living, working, and relaxation. To this end we pledge our efforts: - to accelerate programs for the enhancement of the quality of the nation's waters for the protection of all legitimate water uses, with special emphasis on public water supplies, recreation, fish and wild life; - to extend the national emission control program to all moving sources of air pollution; - to work for programs for the effective disposal of wastes of our modern industrial society; - to support the efforts on national, state, and local levels to preserve the historic monuments and sites of our heritage. - to assist in planning energy production and transportation to fit into the landscape, to assure safety, and to avoid interference with more desirable uses of land for recreation and other public purposes; - to continue to work toward abating the visual pollution that plagues our land; - to focus on the outdoor recreation needs of those who live in congested metropolitan areas; - to continue to work toward strong measures for the reclamation of mined and depleted lands and the conservation of soil. Public Domain. We pledge continued support of the Public Land law Review Commission, which is reviewing public land laws and policies to assure maximum opportunity for all beneficial uses of the public lands, including lands under the sea, and to develop a comprehensive land use policy. We support sustained yield management of our forests, and expanded research for control of forest insects, disease, and fires. We plan to examine the productivity of the public lands in goods, services, and local community prosperity, with a view to increasing such productivity. We shall enforce existing federal statutes governing federal timber. We support the orderly use and development of mineral resources on federal lands. Recreation. We will continue the vigorous expansion of the public recreational domain to meet tomorrow's increasing needs. We will add national parks, recreation areas and seashores, and create national systems of scenic and wild rivers and of trails and scenic roads. We will support a growing wilderness preservation system, preservation of our redwood forests, and conservation of marshland and estuarine areas. Recognizing that the bulk of the task of acquisition and development must be accomplished at the state and local levels, we shall foster federal assistance to encourage such action, as well as recreational expansion by the private sector. To this end, we shall build upon the landmark Land and Water Conservation Fund Act, which has assured a foundation of a recreational heritage for future generations. We will assist communities to rehabilitate and expand inadequate and deteriorating urban park systems, and develop open space, waterways, and waterfront renovation facilities. Resources of the Oceans. In and beneath the seas are resources of untold dimension for the benefit of mankind. Recognizing and protecting the paramount public interest in the seas, Congress, under Democratic leadership, enacted the Sea Grant College Act of 1965 and the Marine Resources and Engineering Development Act of 1966, which established for the first time a comprehensive long-range policy and program for the marine sciences We pledge to pursue vigorously the goals of that Act. Specifically, we will: - Foster marine application of new technology - spacecraft, buoys, data networks, and advanced navigation systems and develop an engineering capability to work on and under the sea at any depth. - Encourage development of underseas resources by intensified research, and better weather forecasting, with recognition the coastal, insular and other litoral states of their unique interest and responsibility; - Foster an extensive program of oceanologic research and development, financed by a portion of the mineral royalty receipts from the outer continental shelf; - Accelerate public and private programs for development of food and other marine resources to meet world-wide malnutrition, to create new industries, and to utilize under-employed manpower living near the waterfront; - Promote our fisheries by providing incentives for private investment enforcing our 12-mile fishing zone, and discouraging other nations from excessive territorial and fishery claims; - Conclude an appropriate Ocean Space Treaty to secure rules and agreements that will facilitate public and private investment, guarantee security of investment and encourage efficient and orderly development of the seas' resources. THE GOVERNMENT In the coming four years, the Democratic President and Democratic Congress will give priority to simplifying and streamlining the processes of government, particularly in the management of the great innovative programs enacted in the 1960's. The Executive branch of the Federal Government is the largest and most complicated enterprise in the world, with programs distributed among 150 separate departments, agencies, bureaus, and boards. This massive operation contributes to and often results in duplication, administrative confusion, and delay. We will seek to streamline this machinery by improving coordination and management of federal programs. We realize that government must develop the capacity to anticipate problems. We support a thorough study of agency operations to determine priorities for governmental action and spending, for examination of the structure of these agencies, and for establishing more systematic means of attacking our nation's problems. We recognize that citizen participation in government is most meaningful at the levels of government closest to the people. For that reason, we recognize the necessity of developing a true partnership between state, local, and Federal governments, with each carrying its share of the financial and administrative load. We acknowledge the tremendous strides made by President Johnson in strengthening federal-state relations through open communication with the governors and local officials, and we pledge to continue and expand on this significant effort. The complexities of Federal-state-local relationships must be simplified so that states and local communities receiving federal aid will have maximum freedom to initiate and carry out programs suited to their own particular needs. To give states and communities greater flexibility in their programs, we will combine individual grant programs into broader categories. As the economy grows, it is the federal revenue system that responds most quickly, yet it may be the states and local government whose responsibilities mount most rapidly. To help states and cities meet their fiscal challenges, we must seek new methods for states and local governments to share in federal revenues while retaining responsibility for establishing their own priorities and for operating their own programs. To this end, we will seek out new and innovative approaches to government to assure that our Federal system does, in fact, deliver to the people the services for which they are paying. Public Employees. The Democratic administration has moved vigorously in the past eight years - particularly with regard to pay scales - to improve the conditions of public service. We support: - A federal service that rewards new ideas and leadership; - Continued emphasis on education and training programs for public employees, before and during their service; - Parity of government salaries with private industry; - A proper respect for the privacy and independence of federal employees; - Equal opportunities for career advancement; - Continued application of the principles of collective bargaining to federal employment; - Encouragement to state and local government to continue to upgrade their personnel systems in terms of pay scales and training. - Interchange of employees between federal and state government. Elections. We are alarmed at the growing costs of political participation in our country and the consequent reliance of political parties and candidates on large contributors, and we want to assure full public information on campaign expenditures. To encourage citizen participation we urge that limited campaign contributions be made deductible as a credit from the federal income tax. We fully recognize the principle of one man, one vote in all elections. We urge that due consideration be given to the question of Presidential primaries throughout the nation. We urge reform of the electoral college and election procedures to assure that the votes of the people are fully reflected. We urge all levels of our Party to assume leadership in removing all remaining barriers to voter registration. We will also seek to eliminate disenfranchisement of voters who change residence during an election year. The District of Columbia. With the reorganization of the government of the District of Columbia, the nation's capital has for the first time in nearly a century the strong leadership provided by a mayor-council form of government. This, however, is no substitute for an independent and fiscally autonomous District government. We support a federally funded charter commission - controlled by District residents - to determine the most appropriate form of government for the District, and the prompt implementation of the Commission's recommendations. The Democratic Party supports full citizenship for residents of the District of Columbia and a Constitutional amendment to grant such citizenship through voting representation in Congress. Until this can be done, we propose non-voting representation. Puerto Rico. In accordance with the democratic principle of self-determination the people of Puerto Rico have expressed their will to continue in permanent union with the United States through commonwealth status. We pledge our continued support to the growth of the commonwealth status which the people of Puerto Rico overwhelmingly approved last year. Virgin Islands and Guam. We favor an elected governor and a non-voting delegate in the House of Representatives for the Virgin Islands and Guam, and will consider methods by which American citizens residing in American territories can participate in presidential elections. Justice and Law We are firm in our commitment that equal justice under law shall be denied to no one. The duty of government at every level is the safety and security of its people. Yet the fact and fear of crime are uppermost in the minds of Americans today. The entire nation is united in its concern over crime, in all forms and wherever it occurs. America must move aggressively to reduce crime and its causes. Democratic Presidents, governors and local government officials are dedicated to the principle that equal justice under law shall remain the American creed. Those who take the law into their own hands undermine that creed. Anyone who breaks the law must be held accountable. Organized crime cannot be accepted as a way of life, nor can individual crime or acts of violence be permitted. As stated in the Report of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, the two fundamental questions confronting the American people are: ""How can we as a people end the resort to violence while we build a better society? ""How can the nation realize the promise of a single society - one nation indivisible - which yet remains unfulfilled?"" This platform commits the Democratic Party to seek resolution of these questions. We pledge a vigorous and sustained campaign against lawlessness in all its forms - organized crime, white collar crime, rioting, and other violations of the rights and liberties of others. We will further this campaign by attack on the root causes of crime and disorder. Under the recent enactments of a Democratic Congress we will continue and increase federal financial support and technical assistance to the states and their local governments to: - Increase the numbers, raise the pay, and improve the training of local police officers; - Reduce delays and congestion in our criminal courts; - Rehabilitate and supervise convicted offenders, to return offenders to useful, decent lives, and to protect the public against habitual criminals; - Develop and deploy the most advanced and effective techniques and equipment for the public safety; - Assure the availability in every metropolitan area of quick, balanced, coordinated control forces, with ample manpower, thoroughly trained and properly equipped, to suppress rioting; - Encourage responsible and competent civic associations, and business and labor groups to cooperate with the law enforcement agencies in new efforts to combat organized crime, to build community support for police work, and assist in rehabilitating convicted offenders - and for the attainment of these ends, encourage our police to cooperate with any such groups and to establish links of communication with every element of the public they serve, building confidence and respect; - Establish and maintain open and responsive channels of communication between the public and the police through creative police-community relations programs; - Develop innovative programs to reduce the incidence of juvenile delinquency; - Promote the passage and enforcement of effective federal, state and local gun control legislation. In all these efforts, our aim is to strengthen state and local law enforcement agencies so that they can do their jobs. In addition, the federal government has a clear responsibility for national action. We have accepted that responsibility and will continue to accept it with these specific objectives: - Prompt and effective federal support, upon request of appropriate authorities, to suppress rioting: improvement of the capabilities of all agencies of law enforcement and justice - the police, the military, the courts - to handle more effectively problems attending riots; - A concentrated campaign by the Federal government to wipe out organized crime by employment of additional Federal investigators and prosecutors; by computerizing the present system of collecting information; by enlarging the program of technical assistance teams to work with the states and local governments that request assistance in this fight; by launching a nationwide program for the country's business and labor leaders to alert them to the problems of organized crime - Intensified enforcement, research, and education to protect the public from narcotics and other damaging drugs: by review of federal narcotics laws for loopholes and 0 difficulties of enforcement; by increased surveillance of the entire drug traffic; through negotiations with those foreign nations which grow and manufacture the bulk of drug derivatives - Vigorous federal leadership to assist and coordinate state and local enforcement efforts, and to ensure that all communities benefit from the resources and knowledge essential to the fight on crime - Further implementation of the recommendations of the President's crime commission; - Creation in the District of Columbia a model system of criminal justice. : - Federal research and development to bring to the problems of law enforcement and the administration of justice the full potential of the scientific revolution. In fighting crime we must not foster injustice. Lawlessness cannot be ended by curtailing the hard-won liberties of all Americans. The right of privacy must be safeguarded. Court procedures must be expedited. Justice delayed is justice denied. A respect for civil peace requires also a proper respect for the legitimate means of expressing dissent. A democratic society welcomes criticism within the limits of the law. Freedom o f speech, press, assembly and association, together with free exercise of the franchise, are among the legitimate means to achieve change in a democratic society. But when the dissenter resorts to violence, he erodes the institutions and values which are the underpinnings of our democratic society. We must not and will not tolerate violence. As President Johnson has stated, ""Our test is to rise above the debate between the rights of the individual and the rights of society by securing the rights of both."" We freely admit that the years we live in are years of turbulence. But the wisdom of history has something hopeful to say about times like these. It tells us that the giant American nation, on the move with giant strides, has never moved - and can never move - in silence. We are an acting, doing, feeling people. We are a people whose deepest emotions are the source of the creative noise we make - precisely because of our ardent desire for unity, our wish for peace, our longing for concord, our demand for justice, our hope for material well being, our impulse to move always toward a more perfect union. In that never-ending quest, we are all partners together - the industrialist and the banker, the workman and the storekeeper, the farmer and the scientist, the clerk and the engineer, the teacher and the student, the clergyman and the writer, the men of all colors and of all the different generations. The American dream is not the exclusive property of any political party. But we submit that the Democratic Party has been the chief instrument of orderly progress in our time. As heirs to the longest tradition of any political party on earth, we Democrats have been trained over the generations to be a party of builders. And that experience has taught us that America builds best when it is called upon to build greatly. We sound that call anew. With the active consent of the American people, we will prove anew that freedom is best secured by a government that is responsive and compassionate and committed to justice and the rule of law.",107881,16965,"the terms of our duty america belongs to the people who inhabit it. the source of the nation's strength is the people's freedom to be the source of the laws governing them. to uphold this truth, when thomas jefferson and james madison brought the democratic party to birth years ago, they bound it to serve the people and their government as a united whole. today, in our 175th anniversary year, the democratic party in national convention assembled, again renews the covenant of our birth. we reaffirm the binding force of our inherited duty to serve the people and their government we here, therefore account for what we have done in the democratic years since . we here state what we will do when our party is again called to lead the nation. in america and in the world over, strong forces for change are on the move. systems of thought have been jarred, ways of life uprooted, institutions are under siege. the governed challenge those who govern. we are summoned, therefore, to a fateful task - to ensure that the turmoil of change will prove to be the turmoil of birth instead of decay. we cannot stand still until we are overtaken by events. we dare not entrust our lives to the blind play of accident and force. by reflection and choice, we must make the impulse for change the agent of orderly progress. there is no alternative. in the world around us, people have patiently lived with hopes long deferred, with grievances long endured. they are now impatient with patience. their demands for change must not only be heard, they must be answered. this is the reality the world as a whole faces. in america itself, now, and not later, is the right time to strengthen the fabric of our society by making justice and equity the cornerstones of order. now, and not later, is the right time to uphold the rule of law by securing to all the people the natural rights that belong to them by virtue of their being human. now, and not later, is the right time to unfurl again the flag of human patriotism and rededicate ourselves under it, to the cause of peace among nations. now, and not later, is the right time to reclaim the strength spent in quarrels over the past and to apply that strength to america's future. now is the right time to proceed with the work of orderly progress that will make the future become what we want it to be. it has always been the object of the democratic party to march at the head of events instead of waiting for them to happen it is our resolve to do that in the years ahead - just as we did in the democratic years since when the nation was led by two democratic presidents and four democratic congresses. this we have done our pride in the achievements of these democratic years in no way blinds us to the large and unfinished tasks which still lie ahead. just as we know where we have succeeded, we know where our efforts still fall short of our own and the nation's hopes. and we candidly recognize that the cost of trying the untried, of ploughing new ground, is bound to be occasional error, in the future, as in the past, we will confront and correct such errors as we carry our program forward. in this, we are persuaded that the almighty judges in a different scale those who err in warmly striving to promote the common good, and those who are free from error because they risked nothing at all and were icily indifferent to good and evil alike. we are also persuaded of something else. what we have achieved with the means at hand - the social inventions we have made since in all areas of our internal life, and the initiatives we have pressed along a broad front in the world arena - gives us a clear title of right to claim that we know how to move the nation forward toward the attainment of its highest goals in a world of change. the economy in presenting first the record of what we have achieved in the economic life of the american people, we do not view the economy as being just dollar signs divorced from the flesh and blood concerns of the people. economics, like politics, involves people and it means people. it means for them the difference between what they don't want and what they do want. it means the difference between justice or injustice, health or sickness, better education or ignorance, a good place to live or a rat infested hovel, a good job or corrosive worry. in the democratic years since , under the leadership of presidents kennedy and johnson, we managed the national economy in ways that kept the best aspirations of people in clear view, and brought them closer to fulfillment. the case was different in the 1950s, when the republicans held the trust of national leadership. in those years, the american economy creaked and groaned from recurrent recessions. one wasteful recession came in , another in , and a third in . the loss in national production from all three recessions and from a sluggish rate of growth-a loss that can fairly be called the gop-gap - was a staggering $ billion computed in today's prices. the democratic party, seeing the republican inertia and the dangers it led to, promised to get america moving again. president kennedy first made that promise for us, and we kept it. we brought an end to recurring recessions each one of which had followed closer on the heels of the vast. full cooperation between our government officials and all sectors of american life led to new public policies which unlocked the creative power of america's free enterprise system. the magnificent response of all the people comprising that system made the world stand in awe of the results. since , we have seen: - a -month period of recession-free prosperity, the longest and strongest period of sustained economic growth in american history; - a slash in the unemployment rate from to under percent; - an increase of nearly percent in real wages and salaries and nearly one-third in the average person's real income; - and, on the eight year average, a reduction in the rate levels of the individual income tax. america's private enterprise system flourished as never before in these years of democratic leadership. compared with the preceding eight republican years, private enterprise in the democratic 's grew twice as fast, profits increased twice as rapidly, four times as many jobs were created, and thirteen million americans - or one-third of those in poverty in - have today escaped its bondage. democrats, however, were not satisfied. we saw - and were the first to see - that even sustained prosperity does not eliminate hardcore unemployment. we were the first to see that millions of americans would never share in america's abundance unless the people as a whole, through their government, acted to supplement what the free enterprise system could do. so, under the leadership of president johnson, this nation declared war on poverty - a war in which the government is again working in close cooperation with leaders of the free enterprise system. it would compromise the integrity of words to claim that the war on poverty and for equal opportunity has been won. democrats are the first to insist that it has only begun - while percent of the house republicans and percent of the senate republicans voted against even beginning it at all. democrats know that much more remains to be done. what we have done thus far is to test a series of pilot projects before making them bigger, and we have found that they do work. thus: - the new pre-school program known as head start has proven its effectiveness in widening the horizons of over two million poor children and their parents - the new programs known as the job corps, and the neighborhood youth corps, entailing close cooperation between the government and private enterprise, have helped nearly two million unskilled boys and girls - most of them dropouts from school - get work in the community and in industry. - the new program known as upward bound has helped thousands of poor but talented young men and women prepare themselves for college. - the new structure of neighborhood centers brings modern community services directly to the people who need them most. the people we emphasize that the coldly stated statistics of gains made in the war on poverty must be translated to mean people in all their yearnings for personal fulfillment. that is true as well of all other things done in the great outpouring of constructive legislation that surpassed even the landmark years of the early new deal. education is one example. from the beginning of our party history, democrats argued that liberty and learning must find in each other the surest ground for mutual support. the inherited conviction provided the motive force behind the educational legislation of the 's that we enacted: - because of the elementary and secondary education act of , local education has been enriched to the benefit of over million young americans; - because of the higher education act of , new college classrooms, laboratories and libraries have been built to assure that higher education will not be the monopoly of the few but the right of the many; - because of federal assistance to students, the doors to college have been opened for over a million young men and women coming from families with modest means - so that about one out of every five college students is now pursuing his higher education with some kind of federal help; - because democrats are convinced that the best of all investments is in the human resources represented by the youth of america, we brought about a four-fold increase in the federal investment in education since . the level now approaches $ billion annually. as it promoted better education, so did democratic leadership promote better health for all. the program of mercy and justice known as health care for the aged, which president truman originally proposed and presidents kennedy and johnson fought for, finally became law in the summer of . because of it, more than seven million older citizens each year are now receiving modem medical care in dignity - no longer forced to depend on charity, no longer a burden on relatives, no longer in physical pain because they cannot afford to pay for the healing power of modern medicine. virtually all older americans, the well and the sick alike, are now protected, their lives more secure, their afflictions eased. to deal with other aspects of the nation's health needs, measures were enacted in the democratic years representing an almost four-fold increase in the government's investment in health. programs were enacted to cope with the killing diseases of heart, cancer and stroke; to combat mental retardation and mental illness; to increase the manpower supply of trained medical technicians; to speed the construction of new hospitals. democrats in the presidency and in the congress have led the fight to erase the stain of racial discrimination that tarnished america's proudly announced proposition that all men are created equal. we knew that racial discrimination was present in every section of the country. we knew that the enforcement of civil rights and general laws are indivisible. in this conviction, democrats took the initiative to guarantee the right to safety and security of the person, the right to all the privileges of citizenship, the right to equality of opportunity in employment, and the right to public services and accommodations and housing. for example: - because of the civil rights act of , all men born equal in the eyes of their creator are by law declared to be equal when they apply for a job, or seek a night's lodging or a good meal; - because of the voting rights act of , the right to the ballot box - the right on which all other rights depend - has been reinforced by law; - because of the civil rights act of , all families will have an equal right to live where they wish. the nation the frontier on which most americans live is the vertical frontier of the city. it is a frontier whose urgent needs hold a place of very high priority on the national agenda - and on the agenda of the democratic party. democrats recognize that the race to save our cities is a race against the absolute of time itself. the blight that threatens their future takes many forms. it is the physical decay of homes and neighborhoods. it is poverty and unemployment. it is broken homes and social disintegration. it is crime. it is congestion and pollution. the democratic program attacked all of these forms of blight - and all at once. since we know that the cities can be saved only by the people who live there, democrats have invigorated local effort through federal leadership and assistance. in almost every city, a community action agency has mounted a many-sided assault on poverty. through varied neighborhood organizations, the poor themselves are tackling their own problems and devising their own programs of self-help. under model cities legislation, enacted in , seventy-five cities are now launching the most comprehensive programs of economic, physical, and social development ever undertaken - and the number of participating cities will be doubled soon. in this effort, the residents of the areas selected to become the model neighborhoods are participating fully in planning their future and deciding what it will be. in a series of housing acts beginning in , democrats have found ways to encourage private enterprise to provide modern, decent housing for low-income and moderate-income families. the housing and urban development act of is the most far-reaching housing legislation in america's history. under its terms, the genius of american business will combine with the productivity of american labor to meet a -year goal of million new housing units - million of them for the poor. the objective is to enable the poor to own their own homes, to rebuild entire neighborhoods, to spur the pace of urban renewal, and to deal more humanely with the problems of displaced people. to give our cities a spokesman of cabinet rank, democrats in took the lead in creating a department of housing and urban development. democratic presidents and congresses halve moved with equal vigor to help the people of america's vast hinterland outside the metropolitan centers to join the march of economic progress. of the major areas classified as ""depressed areas"" when the democrats assumed office in , have now solved their problems of excessive unemployment and the others are on their way. the area redevelopment act, the expansion of resource development programs, and the massive effort to restore appalachia and other lagging regions to economic health assisted the people of these areas in their remarkable progress. in these legislative undertakings of primary concern to people - american people - it is to the credit of some republicans that they joined the democratic majority in a common effort. unfortunately, however, most republicans sat passively by while democrats wrote the legislation the nation's needs demanded worse, and more often, republicans did what they could to obstruct and defeat the measures that were approved by democrats in defiance of hostile republican votes. thus: - in the case of the elementary and secondary education act, percent of the republicans in the house voted to kill it. - in the case of medical care for the aged, percent of the republicans in the house and percent in the senate voted to kill it. - in the case of the model cities program, percent of the republicans in the house voted to kill it. - in the case of the program to help appalachia, percent of house republicans and percent of senate republicans voted to kill it, and percent of house republicans voted to kill corresponding programs of aid for other depressed regions of the country. the same negative attitude was present among republicans in the 's, and one of the results was a crisis in the farm sector of the economy - which the democrats inherited in the 's. in the late republican 's, the glut of farm surpluses amounted to over $ billion, and the taxpayers were forced to pay $ billion every year in interest and storage charges alone. democrats, however, set out resolutely to reverse the picture. democratic farm programs supported farm income, expanded farm exports and domestic consumption, helped farmers adjust their production to the size of the expanded markets. and reduced farm surpluses and storage costs to the lowest level since . democrats have also acted vigorously to assure that american science and technology shall continue to lead the world. in atomic energy, in space exploration, in communications, in medicine, in oceanology, in fundamental and applied research in many fields, we have provided leadership and financial aid to the nation's scientists and engineers. their genius has, in turn, powered our national economic growth. other measures affected all americans everywhere. under our constitutional system of federalism, the primary responsibility for law enforcement rests with selected local officials and with governors, but the federal government can and should play a constructive role in support of state and local authorities in this conviction, democratic leadership secured the enactment of a law which extended financial assistance to modernize local police departments, to train law enforcement personnel, and to develop modern police technology. the effect of these provisions is already visible in an improved quality of law enforcement throughout the land. under democratic leadership, furthermore, the juvenile delinquency prevention and control act was passed to aid states and communities to plan and carry out comprehensive programs to prevent and combat youth crime. we have added more personnel to strengthen the federal bureau of investigation and the enforcement of narcotics laws, and have intensified the campaign against organized crime. the federal government has to come swiftly to the aid of cities needing help to bring major disturbances under control, and democratic leadership secured the enactment of a new gun control law as a step toward putting the weapons of wanton violence beyond the reach of criminal and irresponsible hands. to purify the air we breathe and the water we drink democrats led the way to the enactment of landmark anti-pollution legislation. to bring order into the administration of transportation programs and to coordinate transportation policy, democrats in established a new cabinet-level department of transportation. for the consumer, new standards of protection were enacted - truth-in-lending and truth-in-packaging, the child safety act, the pipeline safety act, the wholesome meat and wholesome poultry acts. for america's million automobile drivers, auto and highway safety legislation provided protection not previously known. for every american family, unparalleled achievements in conservation meant the development of balanced outdoor recreation programs - involving magnificent new national parks, seashores, and lakeshores - all within an afternoon's drive of million americans. for the first time, we are beating the bulldozer to the nation's remaining open spaces. for the sake of living americans and for their posterity, the wilderness preservation act of placed in perpetual trust millions of acres of primitive and wilderness areas. for america's sons who manned the nation's defenses, a new g.i. bill with greatly enlarged equitable benefits was enacted gratefully and proudly. america's senior citizens enjoyed the largest increase in social security since the system was inaugurated during the democratic presidency of franklin d. roosevelt. for the hungry, our food distribution programs were expanded to provide more than $ billion worth of food a year for domestic use, giving millions of children, for the first time, enough to eat. a new minimum wage law raised paychecks and standards of living for millions, while a new network of training programs enabled more than a million americans to learn new skills and become productive workers in the labor force. a new immigration act removed the harsh injustice of the national origins quota system and opened our shores without discrimination to those who can contribute to the growth and strength of america. many more measures enacted under democratic leadership could be added to this recital of achievements in our internal life since . but what we could list shares the character of what we have listed. all the measures alike are a witness to our desire to serve the people as a united whole, to chart the way for their orderly progress, to possess their confidence - by striving through our conduct to deserve to possess it. the world the conscience of the entire world has been shocked by the brutal and unprovoked soviet aggression against czechoslovakia. by this act, moscow has confessed that it is still the prisoner of its fear of freedom. and the czechoslovakian people have shown that the love of freedom, in their land and throughout eastern europe, can never be crushed. this severe blow to freedom and self-determination reinforces our commitment to the unending quest for peace and security in the world. these dark days should not obscure the solid achievements of the past eight years. nuclear war has been avoided. west berlin and western europe are still free. the blend of american power and restraint, so dramatically demonstrated in the cuban missile crisis, earned the respect of the world and prepared the way for a series of arms control agreements with the soviet union. long and patient negotiation by presidents kennedy and johnson resulted in the nuclear test ban, nuclear non-proliferation, and space treaties and the ""hot line."" these hard-won agreements provide the base for pursuing other measures to reduce the risk of nuclear war. the unprecedented expansion of the american economy has invigorated the whole free world. many once skeptical nations, including some communist states, now regard american economic techniques and institutions as a model. in asia the tragic vietnam war has often blinded us to the quiet and constructive developments which affect directly the lives of over a billion people and the prospects for peace everywhere. an economically strong and democratic japan has assumed a more active role in the development of the region. indonesia has a nationalist, non-communist government seeking to live at peace with its neighbors. thailand, taiwan, singapore, malaysia, and the republic of korea have more stable governments and steadily growing economies. they have been aided by american economic assistance and by the american military presence in the pacific. they have also been encouraged by a confidence reflecting successive presidential decisions to assist nations to live in peace and freedom. elsewhere in the developing world, there has been hopeful political and economic progress. though castro's cuba is still a source of subversion, the other latin american states are moving ahead under the alliance for progress. in africa, many of the new states have chosen moderate leaders committed to peaceful nation-building. they are beginning to cooperate with their neighbors in regional agencies of their own design. and like developing countries on other continents, they are for the first time giving serious attention to agricultural development. this new emphasis on food will buy time to launch effective programs of population control. in all these constructive changes america, under democratic leadership, has played a significant role. but we democrats do not believe in resting on past achievements. we view any success as a down payment on the hard tasks that lie ahead. there is still much to be done at home and abroad and we accept with confidence the challenge of the future. this we will do toward a peaceful world in the pursuit of our national objectives and in the exercise of american power in the world, we assert that the united states should: - continue to accept its world responsibilities - not turn inward and isolate ourselves from the cares and aspirations of mankind; - seek a world of diversity and peaceful change, where men can choose their own governments and where each nation can determine its own destiny with external interference; - resist the temptation to try to mold the world, or any part of it, in our own image, or to become the self-appointed policeman of the world; - call on other nations, great and small, to contribute a fair share of effort and resources to world peace and development; - honor our treaty obligations to our allies; - seek always to strengthen and improve the united nations and other international peacekeeping arrangements and meet breaches or threatened breaches of the peace according to our carefully assessed interests and resources; in pursuing these objectives, we will insure that our policies will be subject to constant review so they reflect our true national interests in a changing world. national defense. the tragic events in czechoslovakia are a shocking reminder that we live in a dangerous and unpredictable world. the soviet attack on and invasion of a small country that only yesterday was moscow's peaceful ally, is an ominous reversal of the slow trend toward greater freedom and independence in eastern europe. the reimposition of soviet tyranny raises the spectre of the darkest days of the stalin era and increases the risk of war in central europe, a war that could become a nuclear holocaust. against this somber backdrop, whose full portent cannot now be seen, other recent soviet military moves take on even greater significance. while we have a significant lead in military strength and in all vital areas of military technology, moscow has steadily increased its strategic nuclear arsenal, its missile-firing nuclear submarine fleet, and its anti-missile defenses. communist china is providing political and military support for so-called wars of national liberation. a growing nuclear power, peking has disdained all arms control efforts. we must and will maintain a strong and balanced defense establishment adequate to the task of security and peace. there must be no doubt about our strategic nuclear capability, our capacity to meet limited challenges, and our willingness to act when our vital interests are threatened. to this end, we pledge a vigorous research and development effort. we will also continue to pursue the highly successful efforts initiated by democratic administrations to save tax dollars by eliminating waste and duplication. we face difficult and trying times in asia and in europe. we have responsibilities and commitments we cannot escape with honor. but we are not alone. we have friends and allies around the world. we will consult with them and ask them to accept a fair share of the burdens of peace and security. north atlantic community. the north atlantic community is strong and free. we must further strengthen our ties and be constantly alert to new challenges and opportunities. we support a substantially larger european contribution to nato. soviet troops have never stepped across the border of a nato country. by harassment and threat the kremlin has repeatedly attempted to push the west out of berlin. but west berlin is still free. western europe is still free. this is a living tribute to the strength and validity of the nato alliance. the political differences we have had with some of our allies from time to time should not divert us from our common task of building a secure and prosperous atlantic community based on the principles of mutual respect and mutual dependence. the nato alliance has demonstrated that free nations can build a common shield without sacrificing their identity and independence. arms control. we must recognize that vigilance calls for the twin disciplines of defense and arms control. defense measures and arms control measures must go hand in-hand, each serving national security and the larger interests of peace. we must also recognize that the soviet union and the united states still have a common interest in avoiding nuclear war and preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. we also share a common interest in reducing the cost of national defense. we must continue to work together. we will press' for further arms control agreements, insisting on effective safeguards against violations. for almost a quarter of a century america's pre-eminent military strength, combined with our political restraints has deterred nuclear war. this great accomplishment has confounded the prophets of doom. eight years ago the democratic party pledged new efforts to control nuclear weapons. we have fulfilled that pledge. the new arms control and disarmament agency has undertaken and coordinated important research. the sustained initiatives of president kennedy and president johnson have resulted in the ""hot line"" between the white house and the kremlin, the limited nuclear test ban treaty, the non-proliferation treaty, and the treaty barring the orbiting of weapons of mass destruction. even in the present tense atmosphere, we strongly support president johnson's effort to secure an agreement with the soviet union under which both states would refrain from deploying anti-missile systems. such a treaty would result in the saving of billions of dollars and would create a climate for further arms control measures. we support concurrent efforts to freeze the present level of strategic weapons and delivery systems, and to achieve a balanced and verified reduction of all nuclear and conventional arms. the middle east. the middle east remains a powder keg. we must do all in our power to prevent a recurrence of war in this area. a large soviet fleet has been deployed to the mediterranean. preferring short-term political advantage to long-range stability and peace, the soviet union has rushed arms to certain arab states to replace those lost in the arab-israeli war of . as long as israel is threatened by hostile and well-armed neighbors, we will assist her with essential military equipment needed for her defense, including the most advanced types of combat aircraft. lasting peace in the middle east depends upon agreed and secured frontiers, respect for the territorial integrity of all states, the guaranteed right of innocent passage through all international waterways, a humane resettlement of the arab refugees, and the establishment of a non-provocative military balance. to achieve these objectives, we support negotiations among the concerned parties. we strongly support efforts to achieve an agreement among states in the area and those states supplying arms to limit the flow of military equipment to the middle east. we support efforts to raise the living standards throughout the area, including desalinization and regional irrigation projects which cut across state frontiers. vietnam and asia. our most urgent task in southeast asia is to end the war in vietnam by an honorable and lasting settlement which respects the rights of all the people of vietnam. in our pursuit of peace and stability in the vital area of southeast asia we have borne a heavy burden in helping south vietnam to counter aggression and subversion from the north. we reject as unacceptable a unilateral withdrawal of our forces which would allow that aggression and subversion to succeed. we have never demanded, and do not now demand, unconditional surrender by the communists. we strongly support the paris talks and applaud the initiative of president johnson which brought north vietnam to the peace table. we hope that hanoi will respond positively to this act of statesmanship. in the quest for peace no solutions are free of risk. but calculated risks are consistent with the responsibility of a great nation to seek a peace of reconciliation. recognizing that events in vietnam and the negotiations in paris may affect the timing and the actions we recommend we would support our government in the following steps: bombing - stop all bombing of north vietnam when this action would not endanger the lives of our troops in the field; this action should take into account the response from hanoi. troop withdrawal - negotiate with hanoi an immediate end or limitation of hostilities and the withdrawal from south vietnam of all foreign forces - both united states and allied forces, and forces infiltrated from north vietnam. election of postwar government - encourage all parties and interests to agree that the choice of the postwar government of south vietnam should be determined by fair and safeguarded elections, open to all major political factions and parties prepared to accept peaceful political processes. we would favor an effective international presence to facilitate the transition from war to peace and to assure the protection of minorities against reprisal. interim defense and development measures - until the fighting stops, accelerate our efforts to train and equip the south vietnamese army so that it can defend its own country and carry out cutbacks of u.s. military involvement as the south vietnamese forces are able to take over their larger responsibilities. we should simultaneously do all in our power to support and encourage further economic, political and social development and reform in south vietnam, including an extensive land reform program. we support president johnson's repeated offer to provide a substantial u.s. contribution to the post-war reconstruction of south vietnam as well as to the economic development of the entire region, including north vietnam. japan and the european industrial states should be urged to join in this post-war effort. for the future, we will make it clear that u.s. military and economic assistance in asia will be selective. in addition to considerations of our vital interests and our resources, we will take into account the determination of the nations that request our help to help themselves and their willingness to help each other through regional and multilateral cooperation. we want no bases in south vietnam; no continued military presence and no political role in vietnamese affairs. if and when the communists understand our basic commitment and limited goals and are willing to take their chances, as we are, on letting the choice of the post-war government of south vietnam be determined freely and peacefully by all of the south vietnamese people, then the bloodshed and the tragedy can stop. japan, india, indonesia, and most of the smaller asian nations are understandably apprehensive about red china because of its nuclear weapons, its support of subversive efforts abroad, and its militant rhetoric. they have been appalled by the barbaric behavior of the red guards toward the chinese people, their callous disregard for human life and their mistreatment of foreign diplomats. the immediate prospects that china will emerge from its self-imposed isolation are dim. but both asians and americans will have to coexist with the million chinese on the mainland. we shall continue to make it clear that we are prepared to cooperate with china whenever it is ready to become a responsible member of the international community. we would actively encourage economic, social and cultural exchange with mainland china as a means of freeing that nation and her people from their narrow isolation. we support continued assistance to help maintain the independence and peaceful development of india and pakistan. recognizing the growing importance of asia and the pacific, we will encourage increased cultural and educational efforts, such as those undertaken in multi-racial hawaii, to facilitate a better understanding of the problems and opportunities of this vast area. the developing world. the american people share the aspirations for a better life in the developing world. but we are committed to peaceful change. we believe basic political rights in most states can be more effectively achieved and maintained by peaceful action than by violence. in their struggle for political and economic development, most asian, african, and latin american states are confronted by grinding poverty, illiteracy and a stubborn resistance to constructive change. the aspirations and frustrations of the people are frequently exploited by self-serving revolutionaries who employ illegal and violent means. since world war ii, america's unprecedented program of foreign economic assistance for reconstruction and development has made a profound contribution to peace, security, and a better life for millions of people everywhere. many nations formerly dependent upon american aid are now viable and stable as a result of this aid. we support strengthened u.s. and u.n. development aid programs that are responsive to changing circumstances and based on the recognition, as president johnson put it, that ""self-help is the lifeblood of economic development."" grant aid and government loans for long-term projects are part of a larger transfer of resources between the developed and underdeveloped states, which includes international trade and private capital investment as important components. like the burden of keeping the peace, the responsibility for assisting the developing world must be shared by japan and the western european states, once recipients of u.s. aid and now donor states. development aid should be coordinated among both donors and recipients. the world bank and other international and regional agencies for investment and development should be fully utilized. we should encourage regional cooperation by the recipients for the most efficient use of resources and markets. we should press for additional international agreements that will stimulate mutually beneficial trade and encourage a growing volume of private investment in the developing states. world-wide commodity agreements that stabilize prices for particular products and other devices to stabilize export earnings will also spur development. "" we believe priority attention should be given to agricultural production and population control. technical assistance which emphasizes manpower training is also of paramount importance. we support the peace corps which has sent thousands of ambassadors of good will to three continents. cultural and historic ties and a common quest for peace with freedom and justice have made latin america an area of special concern and interest to the united states. we support a vigorous alliance for progress program based upon the charter of punta del este which affirms that ""free men working through the institutions for representative democracy can best satisfy man's aspirations."" we support the objective of latin american economic integration endorsed by the presidents of the american republics in april , and urge further efforts in the areas of tax reform, land reform, educational reform, and economic development to fulfill the promise of punta del este. united nations. since the birth of the united nations, the united states has pursued the quest for peace, security and human dignity through united nations channels more vigorously than any other member state. our dedication to its purpose and its work remains undiminished. the united nations contributed to dampening the fires of conflict in kashmir, the middle east, cyprus and the congo. the agencies of the united nations have made a significant contribution to health, education and economic well-being in asia, africa and latin america. these efforts deserve continued and expanded support. we pledge that support. since we recognize that the united nations can be only as effective as the support of its members, we call upon other states to join with us in a renewed commitment to use its facilities in the great tasks of economic development, the nonmilitary use of atomic energy, arms control and peacekeeping. it is only with member nations working together that the organization can make its full contribution to the growth of a world community of peace under law, rather than by threat or use of military force. we are profoundly concerned about the continued repression of jews and other minorities in the soviet union and elsewhere, and look forward to the day when the full light of liberty and freedom shall be extended to all countries and all peoples. foreign trade and financial policy. world trade is essential to economic stability. the growing interdependence of nations, particularly in economic affairs, is an established fact of contemporary life. it also spells an opportunity for constructive international cooperation that will bring greater well-being for all and improve the prospects for international peace and security. we shall build upon the trade expansion act of and the kennedy round of trade negotiations, in order to achieve greater trade cooperation and progress toward freer international trade. in future negotiations, which will require careful preparation, we shall: ) seek continued reciprocal reduction and elimination of tariff barriers, based on the most favored nation principle; ) negotiate the reciprocal removal of nontariff barriers to international trade on all products, including agriculture; ) give special attention to the needs of the developing countries for increased export earnings; and ) develop and improve the rules governing fair international competition affecting both foreign commerce and investment. to lessen the hardships suffered by industries and workers as the result of trade liberalization, we support improvements in the adjustment assistance provisions of present law. provision of law to remedy unfair and destructive import competition should be reviewed and strengthened, and negotiated international agreements to achieve this purpose should be employed where appropriate. the united states has experienced balance-of-payments deficits for over a decade, mainly because of our security obligations to the free world. faced with these deficits, we have behaved responsibly by avoiding both economic deflation at home and severe and unilateral restrictive measures on international transactions, which would have weakened the international economy and international cooperation. faced with these deficits, we have behaved responsibly by avoiding both economic deflation at home and severe and unilateral restrictive measures on international transactions, which would have weakened the international economy and international cooperation. we shall continue to take the path of constructive measures by relying on steps to increase our exports and by the development of further cooperative arrangements with the other countries. we intend, as soon as possible, to dismantle the restrictions placed on foreign investment and finance, so that american free enterprise can play its full part as the agent of economic development. we will continue to encourage persons from other lands to visit america. steps of historical importance have already been taken to improve the functioning of the international monetary system, most notably the new special drawing rights under the international monetary fund. we shall continue to work for the further improvement of the international monetary system so as to reduce its vulnerability to monetary crises. economic growth and stability the democratic policies that more than doubled the nation's rate of economic expansion in the past eight years can double and redouble our national income by the end of this century. such a rate of economic growth will enable us to win total victory in our wars on ignorance, poverty, and the misery of the ghettos. but victory will not come automatically. to realize our full economic potential will require effective, businesslike planning and cooperation between government and all elements of private economy. the democratic party pledges itself to achieve that purpose in many ways. fiscal and monetary policy. taxes were lowered in , , and to encourage more private spending and reach full employment, they were raised in and to help prevent inflation, but with a net reduction in the eight democratic years. we will continue to use tax policy to maintain steady economic growth by helping through tax reduction to stimulate the economy when it is sluggish and through temporary tax increases to restrain inflation. to promote this objective, methods must be devised to permit prompt, temporary changes in tax rates within prescribed limits with full participation of the congress in the decisions. the goals of our national tax policy must be to distribute the burden of government equitably among our citizens and to promote economic efficiency and stability. we have placed major reliance on progressive taxes, which are based on the democratic principle of ability to pay. we pledge ourselves to continue to rely on such taxes, and to continue to improve the way they are levied and collected so that every american contributes to government in proportion to his ability to pay. a thorough revamping of our federal taxes has been long overdue to make them more equitable as between rich and poor and as among people with the same income and family responsibilities. all corporation and individual preferences that do not serve the national interest should be removed. tax preferences, like expenditures, must be rigorously evaluated to assure that the benefit to the nation is worth the cost. we support a proposal for a minimum income tax for persons of high income based on an individual's total income regardless of source, in order that wealthy persons will be required to make some kind of income tax contribution, no matter how many tax shelters they use to protect their incomes. we also support a reduction of the tax burden on the poor by lowering the income tax rates at the bottom of the tax scale and increasing the minimum standard deduction. no person or family below the poverty level should be required to pay federal income taxes. our goal is a balanced budget in a balanced economy. we favor distinguishing current operating expenditures from long-term capital outlays and repayable loans, which should be amortized consistent with sound accounting principles. all government expenditures should be subject to firm tests of efficiency and essentiality. an effective policy for growth and stability requires careful coordination of fiscal and monetary policies. changes in taxes, budgets, interest rates, and money supply must be carefully blended and flexibly adjusted to assure: - adaptation to changing economic conditions; - adequate supplies of money and credit for the expansion of industry, commerce, and housing; - maintenance of the lowest possible interest rates; - avoidance of needless hardships on groups that depend heavily on credit. cooperation between fiscal and monetary authorities was greatly strengthened in the past eight years, and we pledge ourselves to continue to perfect this cooperation. price stability with growth. price stability continues to be an essential goal of expansive economic policy. price inflation hurts most the weak among us and could interfere with the continued personal gains we are determined to achieve in the immediate years ahead. the answer to rising prices will never be sought, under democratic administrations, in unemployment and idle plant facilities. we are firmly committed to the twin objectives of full employment and price stability. to promote price stability in a dynamic and growing economy, we will: pursue flexible fiscal and monetary policies designed to keep total private and public demand in line with the economy's steadily rising productive capacity. work effectively with business, labor, and the public in formulating principles for price and wage policies that are equitable and sound for consumers as well as for workers and investors. strictly enforce antitrust and trade practice laws to combat administered pricing, supply limitations and other restrictive practices. strengthen competition by keeping the doors of world trade open and resisting the protectionism of captive markets. stimulate plant modernization, upgrade labor skills, and speed technological advance to step up productivity. agriculture. twice in this century the republican party has brought disaster to the american farmer - in the thirties and in the fifties. each time the american farmer was rescued by the democratic party, but his prosperity has not yet been fully restored farmers must continue to be heard in the councils of government where decisions affecting agriculture are taken. the productivity of our farmers - already the world's most productive - must continue to rise, making american agriculture more competitive abroad and more prosperous at home. a strong agriculture requires fair income to farmers for an expanding output. family farmers must be protected from the squeeze between rising production costs and low prices for their products farm income should grow with productivity just as industrial wages rise with productivity. at the same time, market prices should continue to reflect supply and demand conditions and american farm products must continue to compete effectively m world markets. in this way, markets at home and abroad will continue to expand beyond the record high levels of recent years. to these ends, we shall: take positive action to raise farm income to full parity level in order to preserve the efficient, full-time family farm. this can be done through present farm programs when these programs are properly funded, but these programs will be constantly scrutinized with a view to improvement. actively seek out and develop foreign commercial markets, since international trade in agricultural products is a major favorable factor in the nation's balance of payments. in expanding our trade, we shall strive to ensure that farmers get adequate compensation for their production going into export. expand our food assistance programs to america's poor and our food for peace program to help feed the world's hungry. establish a strategic food and feed reserve plan whereby essential commodities such as wheat, corn and other feed grains, soybeans, storable meat and other products will be stockpiled as a safeguard against crop failures, to assist our nation and other nations in time of famine or disaster, and to ensure adequate supplies for export markets, as well as to protect our own farm industry. this reserve should be insulated from the market. support the right of farmers to bargain collectively in the market place on a commodity-by-commodity basis. labor and industry have long enjoyed this right to bargain collectively under existing legislation. protective legislation for bargaining should be extended to agriculture. continue to support and encourage agricultural co-operatives by expanded and liberal credit, and to protect them from punitive taxation. support private or public credit on reasonable terms to young farmers to enable them to purchase farms on long-term, low-interest loans. support the federal crop insurance program. reaffirm our support of the rural electrification program, recognizing that rural america cannot be revitalized without adequate low-cost electric power. we pledge continued support of programs to assure supplemental financing to meet the growing generating and distributing power needs of rural areas. we support the rural telephone program. support a thorough study of the effect of unlimited payments to farmers. if necessary, we suggest graduated open-end limitations of payments to extremely large corporate farms that participate in government programs. take a positive approach to the public interest in the issue of health and tobacco at all levels of the tobacco economy. we recommend a cooperative effort in health and tobacco research by government, industry and qualified scientific bodies, to ascertain relationships between human health and tobacco growth, curing, storage and manufacturing techniques, as well as specific medical aspects of tobacco smoke constituents. small business. small business plays a vital role in a dynamic, competitive economy; it helps maintain a strong social fabric in communities across the land; it builds concerned community leadership deriving from ownership of small enterprises and it maintains the challenge and competition essential to a free enterprise system. to assure a continuing healthy environment for small business, the democratic party pledges to: assure adequate credit at reasonable costs; assure small business a fair share of government contracts and procurement; encourage investment in research and development of special benefit to small enterprise; assist small business in taking advantage of technological innovations provide centers of information on government procurement needs and foreign sales opportunities. the democratic party is pledged to develop programs that will enable members of minority groups to obtain the financing and technical management assistance needed to succeed in launching and operating new enterprises. labor-management relations. private collective bargaining and a strong and independent labor movement are essential to our system of free enterprise and economic democracy. their development has been fostered under each democratic administration in this century. we will thoroughly review and update the national labor relations act to assure an effective opportunity to all workers to exercise the right to organize and to bargain collectively, including such amendments as: repeal of the provision permitting states to enact compulsory open shop laws; extension of the act's protection to farm workers, employees of private non-profit organizations, and other employees not now covered; removal of unreasonable restrictions upon the right of peaceful picketing, including situs picketing; speedier decisions in unfair labor practice cases and representation proceedings; greater equality between the remedies available under the act to labor and those available to management; effective opportunities for unions as well as employers to communicate with employees, without coercion by either side or by anyone acting in their behalf. the federal government will continue to set an example as an employer to private business and to state and local governments. the government will not do business with firms that repeatedly violate federal statutes prohibiting discrimination against employees who are union members or refuse to bargain with duly authorized union representatives. by all these means, we will sustain the right of workers to organize in unions of their own choosing and will foster truly effective collective bargaining to provide the maximum opportunity for just and fair agreements between management and labor. consumer protection. rising incomes have brought new vigor to the market place. but the march of technology which has brought unparalleled abundance and opportunity to the consumer has also exposed him to new hazards and new complexities. in providing economic justice for consumers, we shall strengthen business and industry and improve the quality of life for all million americans. we commend the democratic congress for passing the landmark legislation of the past several years which has ushered in a l new era of consumer protection - truth-in-lending, truth-in-packaging, wholesome meat and poultry, auto and highway safety, child safety, and protection against interstate land swindles. we shall take steps, including necessary legislation, to minimize the likelihood of massive electric power failures, to improve the safety of medical devices and drugs, to penalize deceptive sales practices, and to provide consumer access to product information now being compiled in the federal government. we will help the states to establish consumer fraud and information bureaus, and to update consumer credit laws. a major objective of all consumer programs, at all levels, must be the education of the buying public, particularly the poor who are the special targets of unscrupulous and high-pressure salesmanship. we will make the consumer's voice increasingly heard in the councils of government. we will strengthen consumer education and enforcement programs by consolidation of functions now dispersed among various agencies, through the establishment of an office of consumer affairs to represent consumer interests within the government and before courts and regulatory agencies. housing. for the first time in history, a nation is able to rebuild or replace all of its substandard housing, even while providing housing for millions of new families. this means rebuilding or replacing . million dwelling units in our urban areas and . million in rural areas, most in conditions of such dilapidation that they are too often dens of despair for millions of americans. yet this performance is possible in the next decade because of goals and programs fashioned by democratic presidents and democratic congresses in close partnership with private business. the goal is clear and pressing - ""a decent home and a suitable living environment for every american family,"" as set forth in the housing act by a democratic congress and administration. to achieve this goal in the next ten years: we will assist private enterprise to double its volume of homebuilding, to an annual rate of . million units a year - a ten-year total of million units. this is the specific target of the history-making housing and urban development act of . we will give the highest priority to federally assisted homebuilding for low-income families, with special attention given to ghetto dwellers, the elderly, the physically handicapped, and families in neglected areas of rural america, indian reservations, territories of the united states and migratory worker camps. all federal subsidy programs - whether in the form of public housing, interest rates at %, rent supplements, or direct loans - will be administered to favor these disadvantaged families, with full participation by neighborhood residents themselves. we will cooperate with private home builders to experiment boldly with new production technology, with financial institutions to marshall capital for housing where it is most needed, and with unions to expand the labor force needed for a doubling of production. above all, we will work toward the greatest possible freedom of choice - the opportunity for every family, regardless of race, color, religion, or income, to choose home ownership or rental, high-rise or low-rise, cooperatives or condominiums, detached or town house, and city, suburban or country living. we urge local governments to shape their own zoning laws and building codes to favor consumers and bold down costs. rigid enforcement of state and local health and building codes is imperative to alleviate conditions of squalor and despair in deteriorating neighborhoods. democrats are proud of their housing record. but we are also painfully aware of how much more needs to be done to reach the final goal of decent shelter for all americans and we pledge a steadfast pursuit of that goal. transportation. america is a nation on the move. to meet the challenge of transportation, we propose a dynamic partnership between industry and government at all levels. of utmost urgency is the need to solve congestion in air traffic, especially in airports and between major metropolitan centers. we pledge intensified efforts to devise equitable methods of financing new and improved airport and airway facilities. urban and inter-urban transportation facilities are heavily overburdened. we support expanded programs of assistance to mass transit in order to avoid unnecessary congestion in air traffic, especially at air link residential and work areas. despite the tremendous progress of our interstate highway program, still more super-highways are needed for safe and rapid motor transport. we need to establish local road networks to meet regional requirements. the efficiency of our railroads has improved greatly but there is need for further strengthening of the nation's railroads so that they can contribute more fully to the nation's transport requirements. in particular, we will press forward with the effort to develop high-speed passenger trains to serve major urban areas. to assume our proper place as a leading maritime nations we must launch an aggressive and balanced program to replace: and augment our obsolete merchant ships with modem vessels; built in american shipyards. we will assist u.s. flag operators to overcome the competitive disparity between american and foreign costs. we will continue to foster development of harbors, ports, and inland waterways, particularly regional waterways systems, and the st. lawrence seaway, to accommodate our expanded water-borne commerce. we support modernization of the panama canal. we pledge a greater investment in transportation research and development to enhance safety and increase speed and economy; to implement the acts that have been passed to control noxious vehicle exhausts, and to reduce aircraft noise. the expansion of our transportation must not be carried out at the expense of the environment through which it moves. we applaud the leadership provided by the first lady to enhance the highway environment and initiate a national beautification program communications. america has the most efficient and comprehensive communications system in the world. but a healthy society depends more on the quality of what is communicated than either the volume or form of communication. public broadcasting has already proven that it can be a valuable supplement to formal education and a direct medium for non-formal education. we pledge our continuing support for the prompt enactment of a long-range financing plan that will help ensure the vigor and independence of this potentially vital but still underdeveloped new force in american life. we deplore the all too frequent exploitation of violence as entertainment in all media. in the democratic party sensed the great potential of space communication and quickly translated this awareness into the communications satellite act. in a creative partnership between government and business, this revolutionary idea soon became a reality. six years later we helped establish a consortium of nations devoted to the development of a global satellite network. we will continue to develop new technology and utilize communications to promote world-wide understanding as an essential pre-condition of world peace. but, in view of rapidly changing technology, the entire federal regulatory system dealing with telecommunication should be thoroughly reappraised. science and technology. we lead the world in science and technology. this has produced a dramatic effect on the daily lives of all of us. to maintain our undisputed national leadership in science and further its manifold applications for the betterment of mankind, the federal government has a clear obligation to foster and support creative men and women in the research community, both public and private. our pioneering space program has helped mankind on earth in countless ways. the benefits from improved weather forecasting which can soon be available thanks to satellite observations and communications will by themselves make the space efforts worthwhile. observation by satellite of crops and other major earth resources will for the first time enable man to see all that is available to him on earth, and therefore to take maximum advantage of it. high-endurance metals developed for spacecraft help make commercial planes safer; similarly, micro-electronics are now found in consumer appliances. novel space food-preservation techniques are employed in the tropical climates of underdeveloped countries. we will move ahead in aerospace research and development for their unimagined promise for man on earth as well as their vital importance to national defense. we shall continue to work for our goal of leadership in space. to this end we will maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of our space programs through utilization of the best program, planning and budgeting systems. to maintain our leadership in the application of energy, we will push forward with research and development to assure a balanced program for the supply of energy for electric power both public and private. this effort should go hand in hand with the development of ""breeder"" reactors and large-scale nuclear desalting plants that can provide pure water economically from the sea for domestic use and agricultural and industrial development in arid regions, and with broadened medical and biological applications of atomic energy. in addition to the physical sciences, the social sciences will be encouraged and assisted to identify and deal with the problem areas of society. opportunity for all we of the democratic party believe that a nation wealthy beyond the dreams of most of mankind - a nation with a twentieth of the world's population, possessing half the world's manufactured goods - has the capacity and the duty to assure to all its citizens the opportunity to enjoy the full measure of the blessings of american life. for the first time in the history of the world, it is within the power of a nation to eradicate from within its borders the age-old curse of poverty. our generation of americans has now made those commitments. it remains to implement and adequately fund the host of practical measures that demonstrate their effectiveness and to continue to devise new approaches. we are guided by the recommendations of the national advisory commission on civil disorders concerning jobs, housing urban renewal, and education on a scale commensurate with the needs of the urban ghettos. we are guided by the report of the commission on rural poverty in tackling the equally compelling problems of the rural slums. economic growth is our first antipoverty program. the best avenue to an independent, confident citizenry is a dynamic, full employment economy. beyond that lie the measures necessary to assure that every american, of every race, in every region, truly shares in the benefits of economic progress. those measures include rehabilitation of the victims of poverty, elimination of the urban and rural slums where poverty is bred, and changes throughout the system of institutions that affect the lives of the poor. in this endeavor, the resources of private enterprise - not only its economic power but its leadership and ingenuity - must be mobilized. we must marshal the power that comes from people working together in communities - the neighborhood communities of the poor and the larger communities of the city, the town, the village, the region. we support community action agencies and their programs, such as head start, that will prevent the children of the poor from becoming the poor of the next generation. we support the extension of neighborhood centers. we are committed to the principle of meaningful participation of the poor in policy-making and administration of community action and related programs. since organizations of many kinds are joined in the war on poverty, problems of coordination inevitably arise. we pledge ourselves to review current antipoverty efforts to assess how responsibility should be distributed among levels of government, among private and public agencies, and between the permanent agencies of the federal government and an independent antipoverty agency. toward a single society. we acknowledge with concern the findings of the report of the bi-partisan national advisory commission on civil disorders and we commit ourselves to implement its recommendations and to wipe out, once and for all, the stain of racial and other discrimination from our national life. ""the major goal,"" the commission wrote, ""is the creation of a true union - a single society and a single american identity."" a single society, however, does not mean social or cultural uniformity. we are a nation of many social, ethnic and national groups. each has brought richness and strength to america. the civil rights acts of and and the voting rights act of , all adopted under the vigorous leadership of president johnson, are basic to america's long march toward full equality under the law. we will not permit these great gains to be chipped away by opponents or eroded by administrative neglect. we pledge effective and impartial enforcement of these laws. if they prove inadequate, or if their compliance provisions fail to serve their purposes, we will propose new laws. in particular, the enforcement provisions of the legislation prohibiting discrimination in employment should be strengthened. this will be done as a matter of first priority. we have also come to recognize that freedom and equality require more than the ending of repression and prejudice. the victims of past discrimination must be encouraged and assisted to take full advantage of opportunities that are now opening to them. we must recognize that for too long we have neglected the abilities and aspirations of spanish-speaking americans to participate fully in american life. we promise to fund and implement the bilingual education act and expand recruitment and training of bilingual federal and state employees. the american indian has the oldest claim on our national conscience. we must continue and increase federal help in the indian's battle against poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, ill health and poor housing. to this end, we pledge a new and equal federal-indian partnership that will enable indian communities to provide for themselves many services now furnished by the federal government and federal sponsorship of industrial development programs owned, managed and run by indians. we support a quick and fair settlement of land claims of indians, eskimo and aleut citizens of alaska. the inner city. in the decaying slums of our larger cities, where so many of our poor are concentrated, the attack on poverty must embrace many interrelated aspects of development - economic development, the rehabilitation or replacement of dilapidated and unsafe housing, job training and placement, and the improvement of education, health, recreation, crime control welfare, and other public services. as the framework of such an effort, we will continue to support the model cities program under which communities themselves are planning and carrying out the most comprehensive plans ever put together for converting their worst slum areas into model neighborhoods - with full participation and leadership by the neighborhood residents themselves. the model cities program will be steadily extended to more cities and more neighborhoods and adequately financed. the resources and leadership of private enterprise must be marshalled in the attack on slums and poverty, and such incentives as may be essential for that purpose we will develop and enact. some of the most urgent jobs in the revival of the inner city remain undone because the hazards are too great and the rewards too limited to attract sufficient private capital. to meet this problem, we will charter a new federal banking structure to provide capital and investment guarantees for urban projects planned and implemented through local initiative - neighborhood development corporations, minority programs for self-employment, housing development corporations, and other urban construction and planning operations. we will also enact legislation providing tax incentives for new business and industrial enterprises in the inner city. our experience with aid to small business demonstrates the importance of increased local ownership of business enterprises in the inner city. we shall aid the universities to concentrate their resources more fully upon the problems of the cities and facilitate their cooperation with municipal agencies and local organizations in finding solutions to urban problems. rural development. balanced growth is essential for america. to achieve that balanced growth, we must greatly increase the growth of the rural non-farm economy. one-third of our people live in rural areas, but only one rural family in ten derives its principal income from farming. almost thirty percent of the nation's poor are non-farm people in rural areas. the problem of rural poverty and the problem of migration of poor people from rural areas to urban ghettos are mainly nonfarm problems. the creation of productive jobs in small cities and towns can be the best and least costly solution of these problems. to revitalize rural and small-town america and assure equal opportunity for all americans wherever they live, we pledge to: create jobs by offering inducements to new enterprises - using tax and other incentives - to locate in small towns and rural areas; administer existing federal programs and design new programs where necessary to overcome the disparity between rural and urban areas in opportunities for education, for health services, for low income housing, for employment and job training, and for public services of all kinds; encourage the development of new towns and new growth centers; encourage the creation of comprehensive planning and development agencies to provide additional leadership in non-metropolitan areas, and assist them financially. the experience of the appalachian and other regional commissions indicates that municipalities, counties, and state and federal agencies can work together in a common development effort. jobs and training. every american in need of work should have opportunity not only for meaningful employment, but also for the education, training, counselling, and other services that enable him to take advantage of available jobs. to the maximum possible extent, our national goal of full employment should be realized through creation of jobs in the private economy, where six of every seven americans now work. we will continue the job opportunities in the business sector (jobs) program, which for the first time has mobilized the energies of business and industry on a nationwide scale to provide training and employment to the hardcore unemployed. we will develop whatever additional incentives may be necessary to maximize the opportunities in the private sector for hardcore unemployed. we will continue also to finance the operation by local communities of a wide range of training programs for youth and retraining for older workers whose skills have become obsolete coupled with related services necessary to enable people to undertake training and accept jobs - including improved recruitment and placement services, day-care centers, and transportation between work and home. for those who can work but cannot find jobs, we pledge to expand public job and job-training programs, including the neighborhood youth corps, to provide meaningful employment in state and local government and nonprofit institutions. for those who cannot obtain other employment, the federal government will be the employer of last resort, either through federal assistance to state and local projects or through federally sponsored projects. employment standards. american workers are entitled to more than the right to a job. they have the right to fair and safe working conditions and to adequate protection in periods of unemployment or disability. in the last thirty years democratic administrations and congresses have enacted, extended and improved a series of measures to provide safeguards against exploitation and distress. we pledge to continue these efforts. the minimum standards covering terms and conditions of employment must be improved: by increasing the minimum wage guarantee to assure those at the bottom the economic scale a fairer share in rising living standards; by extending the minimum wage and overtime provision of the fair labor standards act to all workers; by enacting occupational health and safety legislation to assure the material reduction of the present occupational death rate of , men and women each year, and the disabling accident rate of over million per year; by assuring that the ""green card"" worker does not depress wages and conditions of employment for american workers; by updating of the benefit provisions of the longshoremen and harbor workers act. the unemployment compensation program should be modernized by national minimum standards for level and duration of benefits, eligibility, and universal coverage. older citizens. a lifetime of work and effort deserves a secure and satisfying retirement. benefits, especially minimum benefits, under old age, survivors, and disability insurance, should be raised to overcome present inadequacies and thereafter should be adjusted automatically to reflect increases in living costs. medical care for the aged should be expanded to include the costs of prescription drugs. the minimum age for public assistance should be lowered to correspond to the requirements for social security. america's self-employed citizens should be encouraged by tax incentive legislation to supplement social security benefits for themselves and their employees to the same extent that employees of corporations are encouraged. in addition to improving social security, we must develop in each community a wide variety of activities to enrich the lives of our older citizens, to enable them to continue to contribute to our society and to permit them to live in dignity. the aged must have access to better housing, opportunities for regular or part-time employment and community volunteer service, and cultural and recreational activities. people in need. every american family whose income is not sufficient to enable its members to live in decency should receive assistance free of the indignities and uncertainties that still too often mar our present programs. to support family incomes of the working poor a number of new program proposals have recently been developed. a thorough evaluation of the relative advantages of such proposals deserves the highest priority attention by the next administration. this we pledge to do. income payments and eligibility standards for the aged, the blind, the disabled and dependent children should be determined and financed on a federal basis - in place of the present inequitable, under-financed hodge-podge state plans. this would, among other things, assure the eligibility in all states of needy children of unemployed parents who are now denied assistance in more than half the states as long as the father remains in the home. assistance payments should not only be brought to adequate levels but they should be kept adequate by providing for automatic adjustment to reflect increases in living costs. congress has temporarily suspended the restrictive amendment of that placed an arbitrary limit on the number of dependent children who can be aided in each state. we favor permanent repeal of that restriction and of the provision requiring mothers of young children to work. the new federal-state program we propose should provide for financial incentives and needed services to enable and encourage adults on welfare to seek employment to the extent they are able to do so. the time has come when we should make a national commitment that no american should have to go hungry or undernourished. the democratic party here and now does make that commitment. we will move rapidly to implement it through continued improvement and expansion of our food programs. the democratic congress this year has already enacted legislation to expand and improve the school lunch and commodity distribution programs, and shortly will complete action on legislation now pending to expand the food stamp program. we will enact further legislation and appropriations to assure on a permanent basis that the school lunch program provides free and reduced-price meals to all needy school children. health. the best of modern medical care should be made available to every american. we support efforts to overcome the remaining barriers of distance, poverty, ignorance, and discrimination that separate persons from adequate medical services. during the last eight years of democratic administrations this nation has taken giant steps forward in assuring life and health for its citizens. in the years ahead, we democrats are determined to take those final steps that are necessary to make certain that every american, regardless of economic status, shall live out his years without fear of the high costs of sickness. through a partnership of government and private enterprise we must develop new coordinated approaches to stem the rise in medical and drug costs without lowering the quality or availability of medical care. out-of-hospital care, comprehensive group practice arrangements increased availability of neighborhood health centers, and the greater use of sub-professional aides can a contribute to the lowering of medical costs. we will raise the level of research in all fields of health with special programs for development of the artificial heart and heart transplant technique, development of drugs to prevent the recurrence of heart diseases, expansion of current task forces in cancer research and the creation of new ones including cancer of the lung, determination of the factors in mental retardation and reduction of infant mortality, development of drugs to reduce the incidence of suicide and construction of health research facilities and hospitals. we must build new medical, dental and medical service schools, and increase the capacity of existing ones, to train more doctors, dentists, nurses and medical technicians. medical care should be extended to disabled beneficiaries under the old age, survivors and disability insurance act to the same extent and under the same system that such care is available to the aged. thousands of children die, or are handicapped for life, because their mothers did not receive proper pre-natal medical attention or because the infants were unattended in the critical first days of life. maternal and child health centers, located and designed to serve the needs of the poor, and voluntary family planning information centers should be established throughout the country. medicaid programs administered by the states should have uniform standards so that no mother or child is denied necessary health services. finally, we urge consideration of a program comparable to medicare to finance prenatal care for mothers and post-natal care for children during the first year of life. veterans. american veterans deserve our enduring gratitude for their distinguished service to the nation. in some , returning servicemen will continue their education with increased benefits under the new g.i. bill passed by an education-minded democratic congress. two million disabled veterans and survivors of those killed in action are receiving larger pensions and higher disability payments. guided by the report of the veterans advisory commission, established by the democratic administration, we will: - continue a strong one-stop agency vested with sole responsibility for all veterans programs; - sustain and upgrade veteran medical services and expand medical training in va hospitals; - maintain compensation for disabled veterans and for widows and dependents of veterans who die of service-connected causes, in line with the rise in earnings and living standards; - assure every veteran the right of burial in a national cemetery; - provide incentives for veterans to aid their communities by serving in police, fire departments, educational systems and other public endeavors. - make veterans and their widows eligible for pension benefits at the same age at which social security beneficiaries may receive old age benefits. - we recommend the establishment of a standing committee on veterans affairs in the senate. education. education is the chief instrument for making good the american promise. it is indispensable to every man's chance to achieve his full potential. we will seek to open education to all americans. we will assure equal opportunity to education and equal access to high-quality education. our aim is to maintain state and local control over the nation's educational system, with federal financial assistance and help in stimulating changes through demonstration and technical assistance. new concepts of education and training employing new communications technology must be developed to educate children and adults. every citizen has a basic right to as much education and training as he desires and can master - from preschool through graduate studies - even if his family cannot pay for this education. we will marshal our national resources to help develop and finance new and effective methods - of dealing with the educationally disadvantaged-including expanded preschool programs to prepare all young children for full participation in formal education, improved teacher recruitment and training programs for inner city and rural schools, the teacher corps, assistance to community controlled schools to encourage pursuit of innovative practices, university participation in research and operation of school programs, a vocational education system that will provide imaginative new ties between school and the world of work, and improved and more widespread adult education programs. we will fully fund title i of the elementary and secondary education act of , which provides federal funds for improving education in schools serving large numbers of students from low income families. the financial burden of education continues to grow as enrollments spiral and costs increase. the home owner's property tax burden must be eased by increased levels of financial aid by both the states and the federal government. our rapidly expanding educational frontiers require a redoubling of efforts to insure the vitality of a diverse higher education system - public and private, large and small, community and junior colleges, vocational and technical schools, and great universities. we also pledge support for high quality graduate and medical education. we will enlarge the federal scholarship program to remove the remaining financial barriers to post-secondary education for low income youths, and increase assistance to students in the form of repayable loans out of future income. we will encourage support for the arts and the humanities, through the national foundations established by a democratic congress to provide incentives for those endowed with extraordinary talent, enhance the quality of our life, and make productive leisure available to all our people. we recommend greater stress on the arts and humanities in elementary and secondary curricula to ensure a proper educational balance. youth. for generations, the democratic party has renewed its vitality with young people and new ideas. today, young people are bringing new vigor and a deep concern for social justice into the political process, yet many feel excluded from full participation. we of the democratic party welcome the bold thinking and exciting ideas of youth. we recognize, with deep satisfaction, that their healthy desire for participation in the democratic system must lead to a series of reforms in the direction of a greater democracy and a more open america. the democratic party takes pride in the fact that so many of today's youth have channeled their interests and energies into our party. to them, and to all young americans we pledge the fullest opportunity to participate in the affairs of our party at the local, state, and national levels. we call for special efforts to recruit young people as candidates for public office. we will support a constitutional amendment lowering the voting age to . we favor an increase in youth representation on state delegations in future democratic conventions. steps should be taken to include youth advisors on all government studies, commissions, and hearings which are relevant to their lives. we will establish a youth commission involving young people between the ages of and . every young person should have an opportunity to contribute to the social health of his community or for humanitarian service abroad. the extraordinary experience of the teacher corps, vista, and the peace corps points the way for broadening the opportunities for such voluntary service. hundreds of thousands of america's youth have sought to enlist in these programs, but only tens of thousands have been able to serve. we will expand these opportunities. the lives of millions of young men are deeply affected by the requirement for military service. the present system leaves them in uncertainty through much of their early manhood. until our manpower needs can be fully met by voluntary enlistment, the democratic party will insist upon the most equitable and just selection system that can be devised. we support a random system of selection which will reduce the period of eligibility to one year, guarantee fair selection, and remove uncertainty. we urge review of draft board memberships to make them more representative of the communities they serve. environment, conservation and natural resources these united states have undergone years of continuous change and dramatic development resulting in the most technologically advanced nation in the world. but with rapid industrialization, the nation's air and water resources have been degraded, the public health and welfare endangered, the landscape scarred and littered, and the very quality of our national life jeopardized. we must assure the availability of a decent environment for living, working, and relaxation. to this end we pledge our efforts: - to accelerate programs for the enhancement of the quality of the nation's waters for the protection of all legitimate water uses, with special emphasis on public water supplies, recreation, fish and wild life; - to extend the national emission control program to all moving sources of air pollution; - to work for programs for the effective disposal of wastes of our modern industrial society; - to support the efforts on national, state, and local levels to preserve the historic monuments and sites of our heritage. - to assist in planning energy production and transportation to fit into the landscape, to assure safety, and to avoid interference with more desirable uses of land for recreation and other public purposes; - to continue to work toward abating the visual pollution that plagues our land; - to focus on the outdoor recreation needs of those who live in congested metropolitan areas; - to continue to work toward strong measures for the reclamation of mined and depleted lands and the conservation of soil. public domain. we pledge continued support of the public land law review commission, which is reviewing public land laws and policies to assure maximum opportunity for all beneficial uses of the public lands, including lands under the sea, and to develop a comprehensive land use policy. we support sustained yield management of our forests, and expanded research for control of forest insects, disease, and fires. we plan to examine the productivity of the public lands in goods, services, and local community prosperity, with a view to increasing such productivity. we shall enforce existing federal statutes governing federal timber. we support the orderly use and development of mineral resources on federal lands. recreation. we will continue the vigorous expansion of the public recreational domain to meet tomorrow's increasing needs. we will add national parks, recreation areas and seashores, and create national systems of scenic and wild rivers and of trails and scenic roads. we will support a growing wilderness preservation system, preservation of our redwood forests, and conservation of marshland and estuarine areas. recognizing that the bulk of the task of acquisition and development must be accomplished at the state and local levels, we shall foster federal assistance to encourage such action, as well as recreational expansion by the private sector. to this end, we shall build upon the landmark land and water conservation fund act, which has assured a foundation of a recreational heritage for future generations. we will assist communities to rehabilitate and expand inadequate and deteriorating urban park systems, and develop open space, waterways, and waterfront renovation facilities. resources of the oceans. in and beneath the seas are resources of untold dimension for the benefit of mankind. recognizing and protecting the paramount public interest in the seas, congress, under democratic leadership, enacted the sea grant college act of and the marine resources and engineering development act of , which established for the first time a comprehensive long-range policy and program for the marine sciences we pledge to pursue vigorously the goals of that act. specifically, we will: - foster marine application of new technology - spacecraft, buoys, data networks, and advanced navigation systems and develop an engineering capability to work on and under the sea at any depth. - encourage development of underseas resources by intensified research, and better weather forecasting, with recognition the coastal, insular and other litoral states of their unique interest and responsibility; - foster an extensive program of oceanologic research and development, financed by a portion of the mineral royalty receipts from the outer continental shelf; - accelerate public and private programs for development of food and other marine resources to meet world-wide malnutrition, to create new industries, and to utilize under-employed manpower living near the waterfront; - promote our fisheries by providing incentives for private investment enforcing our -mile fishing zone, and discouraging other nations from excessive territorial and fishery claims; - conclude an appropriate ocean space treaty to secure rules and agreements that will facilitate public and private investment, guarantee security of investment and encourage efficient and orderly development of the seas' resources. the government in the coming four years, the democratic president and democratic congress will give priority to simplifying and streamlining the processes of government, particularly in the management of the great innovative programs enacted in the 's. the executive branch of the federal government is the largest and most complicated enterprise in the world, with programs distributed among separate departments, agencies, bureaus, and boards. this massive operation contributes to and often results in duplication, administrative confusion, and delay. we will seek to streamline this machinery by improving coordination and management of federal programs. we realize that government must develop the capacity to anticipate problems. we support a thorough study of agency operations to determine priorities for governmental action and spending, for examination of the structure of these agencies, and for establishing more systematic means of attacking our nation's problems. we recognize that citizen participation in government is most meaningful at the levels of government closest to the people. for that reason, we recognize the necessity of developing a true partnership between state, local, and federal governments, with each carrying its share of the financial and administrative load. we acknowledge the tremendous strides made by president johnson in strengthening federal-state relations through open communication with the governors and local officials, and we pledge to continue and expand on this significant effort. the complexities of federal-state-local relationships must be simplified so that states and local communities receiving federal aid will have maximum freedom to initiate and carry out programs suited to their own particular needs. to give states and communities greater flexibility in their programs, we will combine individual grant programs into broader categories. as the economy grows, it is the federal revenue system that responds most quickly, yet it may be the states and local government whose responsibilities mount most rapidly. to help states and cities meet their fiscal challenges, we must seek new methods for states and local governments to share in federal revenues while retaining responsibility for establishing their own priorities and for operating their own programs. to this end, we will seek out new and innovative approaches to government to assure that our federal system does, in fact, deliver to the people the services for which they are paying. public employees. the democratic administration has moved vigorously in the past eight years - particularly with regard to pay scales - to improve the conditions of public service. we support: - a federal service that rewards new ideas and leadership; - continued emphasis on education and training programs for public employees, before and during their service; - parity of government salaries with private industry; - a proper respect for the privacy and independence of federal employees; - equal opportunities for career advancement; - continued application of the principles of collective bargaining to federal employment; - encouragement to state and local government to continue to upgrade their personnel systems in terms of pay scales and training. - interchange of employees between federal and state government. elections. we are alarmed at the growing costs of political participation in our country and the consequent reliance of political parties and candidates on large contributors, and we want to assure full public information on campaign expenditures. to encourage citizen participation we urge that limited campaign contributions be made deductible as a credit from the federal income tax. we fully recognize the principle of one man, one vote in all elections. we urge that due consideration be given to the question of presidential primaries throughout the nation. we urge reform of the electoral college and election procedures to assure that the votes of the people are fully reflected. we urge all levels of our party to assume leadership in removing all remaining barriers to voter registration. we will also seek to eliminate disenfranchisement of voters who change residence during an election year. the district of columbia. with the reorganization of the government of the district of columbia, the nation's capital has for the first time in nearly a century the strong leadership provided by a mayor-council form of government. this, however, is no substitute for an independent and fiscally autonomous district government. we support a federally funded charter commission - controlled by district residents - to determine the most appropriate form of government for the district, and the prompt implementation of the commission's recommendations. the democratic party supports full citizenship for residents of the district of columbia and a constitutional amendment to grant such citizenship through voting representation in congress. until this can be done, we propose non-voting representation. puerto rico. in accordance with the democratic principle of self-determination the people of puerto rico have expressed their will to continue in permanent union with the united states through commonwealth status. we pledge our continued support to the growth of the commonwealth status which the people of puerto rico overwhelmingly approved last year. virgin islands and guam. we favor an elected governor and a non-voting delegate in the house of representatives for the virgin islands and guam, and will consider methods by which american citizens residing in american territories can participate in presidential elections. justice and law we are firm in our commitment that equal justice under law shall be denied to no one. the duty of government at every level is the safety and security of its people. yet the fact and fear of crime are uppermost in the minds of americans today. the entire nation is united in its concern over crime, in all forms and wherever it occurs. america must move aggressively to reduce crime and its causes. democratic presidents, governors and local government officials are dedicated to the principle that equal justice under law shall remain the american creed. those who take the law into their own hands undermine that creed. anyone who breaks the law must be held accountable. organized crime cannot be accepted as a way of life, nor can individual crime or acts of violence be permitted. as stated in the report of the national advisory commission on civil disorders, the two fundamental questions confronting the american people are: ""how can we as a people end the resort to violence while we build a better society? ""how can the nation realize the promise of a single society - one nation indivisible - which yet remains unfulfilled?"" this platform commits the democratic party to seek resolution of these questions. we pledge a vigorous and sustained campaign against lawlessness in all its forms - organized crime, white collar crime, rioting, and other violations of the rights and liberties of others. we will further this campaign by attack on the root causes of crime and disorder. under the recent enactments of a democratic congress we will continue and increase federal financial support and technical assistance to the states and their local governments to: - increase the numbers, raise the pay, and improve the training of local police officers; - reduce delays and congestion in our criminal courts; - rehabilitate and supervise convicted offenders, to return offenders to useful, decent lives, and to protect the public against habitual criminals; - develop and deploy the most advanced and effective techniques and equipment for the public safety; - assure the availability in every metropolitan area of quick, balanced, coordinated control forces, with ample manpower, thoroughly trained and properly equipped, to suppress rioting; - encourage responsible and competent civic associations, and business and labor groups to cooperate with the law enforcement agencies in new efforts to combat organized crime, to build community support for police work, and assist in rehabilitating convicted offenders - and for the attainment of these ends, encourage our police to cooperate with any such groups and to establish links of communication with every element of the public they serve, building confidence and respect; - establish and maintain open and responsive channels of communication between the public and the police through creative police-community relations programs; - develop innovative programs to reduce the incidence of juvenile delinquency; - promote the passage and enforcement of effective federal, state and local gun control legislation. in all these efforts, our aim is to strengthen state and local law enforcement agencies so that they can do their jobs. in addition, the federal government has a clear responsibility for national action. we have accepted that responsibility and will continue to accept it with these specific objectives: - prompt and effective federal support, upon request of appropriate authorities, to suppress rioting: improvement of the capabilities of all agencies of law enforcement and justice - the police, the military, the courts - to handle more effectively problems attending riots; - a concentrated campaign by the federal government to wipe out organized crime by employment of additional federal investigators and prosecutors; by computerizing the present system of collecting information; by enlarging the program of technical assistance teams to work with the states and local governments that request assistance in this fight; by launching a nationwide program for the country's business and labor leaders to alert them to the problems of organized crime - intensified enforcement, research, and education to protect the public from narcotics and other damaging drugs: by review of federal narcotics laws for loopholes and difficulties of enforcement; by increased surveillance of the entire drug traffic; through negotiations with those foreign nations which grow and manufacture the bulk of drug derivatives - vigorous federal leadership to assist and coordinate state and local enforcement efforts, and to ensure that all communities benefit from the resources and knowledge essential to the fight on crime - further implementation of the recommendations of the president's crime commission; - creation in the district of columbia a model system of criminal justice. : - federal research and development to bring to the problems of law enforcement and the administration of justice the full potential of the scientific revolution. in fighting crime we must not foster injustice. lawlessness cannot be ended by curtailing the hard-won liberties of all americans. the right of privacy must be safeguarded. court procedures must be expedited. justice delayed is justice denied. a respect for civil peace requires also a proper respect for the legitimate means of expressing dissent. a democratic society welcomes criticism within the limits of the law. freedom o f speech, press, assembly and association, together with free exercise of the franchise, are among the legitimate means to achieve change in a democratic society. but when the dissenter resorts to violence, he erodes the institutions and values which are the underpinnings of our democratic society. we must not and will not tolerate violence. as president johnson has stated, ""our test is to rise above the debate between the rights of the individual and the rights of society by securing the rights of both."" we freely admit that the years we live in are years of turbulence. but the wisdom of history has something hopeful to say about times like these. it tells us that the giant american nation, on the move with giant strides, has never moved - and can never move - in silence. we are an acting, doing, feeling people. we are a people whose deepest emotions are the source of the creative noise we make - precisely because of our ardent desire for unity, our wish for peace, our longing for concord, our demand for justice, our hope for material well being, our impulse to move always toward a more perfect union. in that never-ending quest, we are all partners together - the industrialist and the banker, the workman and the storekeeper, the farmer and the scientist, the clerk and the engineer, the teacher and the student, the clergyman and the writer, the men of all colors and of all the different generations. the american dream is not the exclusive property of any political party. but we submit that the democratic party has been the chief instrument of orderly progress in our time. as heirs to the longest tradition of any political party on earth, we democrats have been trained over the generations to be a party of builders. and that experience has taught us that america builds best when it is called upon to build greatly. we sound that call anew. with the active consent of the american people, we will prove anew that freedom is best secured by a government that is responsive and compassionate and committed to justice and the rule of law.","['terms',

Republican Party,1968,1960,rep_1968.csv,CSV,"PREAMBLE, PURPOSES AND PLEDGES Twice before, our Party gave the people of America leadership at a time of crisis - leadership which won us peace in place of war, unity in place of discord, compassion in place of bitterness. A century ago, Abraham Lincoln gave that leadership. From it came one nation, consecrated to liberty and justice for all. Fifteen years ago, Dwight D. Eisenhower gave that leadership. It brought the end of a war, eight years of peace, enhanced respect in the world, orderly progress at home, and trust of our people in their leaders and in themselves. Today, we are in turmoil. Tens of thousands of young men have died or been wounded in Vietnam. Many young people are losing faith in our society. Our inner cities have become centers of despair. Millions of Americans are caught in the cycle of poverty - poor education, unemployment or serious under-employment, and the inability to afford decent housing. Inflation has eroded confidence in the dollar at home and abroad. It has severely cut into the incomes of all families, the jobless, the farmers, the retired and those living on fixed incomes and pensions. Today's Americans are uncertain about the future, and frustrated about the recent past. America urgently needs new leadership - leadership courageous and understanding - leadership that will recapture control of events, mastering them rather than permitting them to master us, thus restoring our confidence in ourselves and in our future. Our need is new leadership which will develop imaginative new approaches assuring full opportunity to all our citizens - leadership which will face and resolve the basic problems of our country. Our Convention in 1968 can spark a ""Republican Resurgence"" under men and women willing to face the realities of the world in which we live. We must urgently dedicate our efforts toward restoration of peace both at home and abroad. We must bring about a national commitment to rebuild our urban and rural slum areas. We must enable family farm enterprise to participate fully in the nation's prosperity. We must bring about quality education for all. We must assure every individual an opportunity for satisfying and rewarding employment. We must attack the root causes of poverty and eradicate racism, hatred and violence. We must give all citizens the opportunity to influence and shape the events of our time. We must give increasing attention to the views of the young and recognize their key role in our present as well as the future. We must mobilize the resources, talents and energy of public and private sectors to reach these goals, utilizing the unique strength and initiative of state and local governments. We must reestablish fiscal responsibility and put an end to increases in the cost of living. We must reaffirm our commitment to Lincoln's challenge of one hundred six years ago. To Congress he wrote: "" The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country."" In this, our stormy present, let us rededicate ourselves to Lincoln's thesis. Let the people know our commitment to provide the dynamic leadership which they rightly expect of this Party -- the Party not of empty promises, but of performance -- the Party not of wastefulness, but of responsibility -- the Party not of war, but the Party whose Administrations have been characterized by peace -- the Republican Party. To these ends, we solemnly pledge to every American that we shall think anew and act anew. DOMESTIC POLICY A peaceful, reunified America, with opportunity and orderly progress for all -- these are our overriding domestic goals. Clearly we must think anew about the relationship of man and his government, of man and his fellow-man. We must act anew to enlarge the opportunity and autonomy of the individual and the range of his choice. Republican leadership welcomes challenge. We eagerly anticipate new achievement. A new, vital partnership of government at all levels will be a prime Republican objective. We will broaden the base of decision-making. We will create a new mix of private responsibility and public participation in the solution of social problems. There is so much which urgently needs to be done. In many areas poverty and its attendant ills afflict large numbers of Americans. Distrust and fear plague us all. Our inner cities teem with poor, crowded in slums. Many rural areas are run down and barren of challenge or opportunity. Minorities among us -- particularly the black community, the Mexican-American, the American Indian -- suffer disproportionately. Americans critically need -- and are eager for -- new and dynamic leadership. We offer that leadership -- a leadership to eradicate bitterness and discrimination -- responsible, compassionate leadership that will keep its word -- leadership every citizen can count on to move this nation forward again, confident, reunited, and sure of purpose. Crisis of the Cities For today and tomorrow, there must be -- and we pledge -- a vigorous effort nation-wide, to transform the blighted areas of cities into centers of opportunity and progress, culture and talent. For tomorrow, new cities must be developed -- and smaller cities with room to grow, expanded to house and serve another 100 million Americans by the turn of the century. The need is critical. Millions of our people are suffering cruelly from expanding metropolitan blight -- congestion, crime, polluted air and water, poor housing, inadequate educational, economic and recreational opportunities. This continuing decay of urban centers -- the deepening misery and limited opportunity of citizens living there -- is intolerable in America. We promise effective, sustainable action enlisting new energies by the private sector and by governments at all levels. We pledge: Presidential leadership which will buttress state and local government; Vigorous federal support to innovative state programs using new policy techniques such as urban development corporations to help rebuild our cities; Energetic, positive leadership to enforce statutory and constitutional protections to eliminate discrimination; Concern for the unique problems of citizens long disadvantaged in our total society by race, color, national origin, creed, or sex; A greater involvement of vast private enterprise resources in the improvement of urban life, induced by tax and other incentives; New technological and administrative approaches through flexible federal programs enabling and encouraging communities to solve their own problems; A complete overhaul and restructuring of the competing and overlapping jumble of federal programs to enable state and local governments to focus on priority objectives. These principles as urgently apply to rural poverty and decay. There must be a marked improvement of economic and educational opportunities to relieve widespread distress. Success with urban problems in fact requires acceleration of rural development in order to stem the flow of people from the countryside to the city. Air and water pollution, already acute in many areas, require vigorous state and federal action, regional planning, and maximum cooperation among neighboring cities, counties and states. We will encourage this planning and cooperation and also spur industrial participation by means of economic incentives. Skyrocketing building costs and interest rates have crippled home building and threaten a housing crisis in the nation, endangering the prospect of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every family. We will vigorously implement the Republican-conceived homeownership program for lower income families and also the Republican-sponsored rent certificate program. Economic incentives will be developed to attract private industry and capital to the low-cost housing market. By reducing interest rates through responsible fiscal and monetary policy we will lower the costs of homeownership, and new technologies and programs will be developed to stimulate low-cost methods of housing rehabilitation. Local communities will be encouraged to adopt uniform, modern building codes, research in cost-cutting technology through private enterprise will be accelerated, and innovative state and local programs will be supported. We will also stimulate the investment of ""sweat equity"" by home owners. Our metropolitan transportation systems - the lifelines of our cities - have become tangled webs of congestion which not only create vast citizen inconvenience, discontent and economic inefficiency, but also tend to barricade inner city people against job opportunities in suburban areas. We will encourage priority attention by private enterprise and all levels of government to sound planning and the rapid development of improved mass transportation systems. Additionally, in the location of federal buildings and installations and the awarding of federal contracts, account will be taken of such factors as traffic congestion, housing, and the effect on community development. Americans are acutely aware that none of these objectives can be achieved unless order through law and justice is maintained in our cities. Fire and looting, causing millions of dollars of property damage, have brought great suffering to home owners and small businessmen, particularly in black communities least able to absorb catastrophic losses. The Republican Party strongly advocates measures to alleviate and remove the frustrations that contribute to riots. We simultaneously support decisive action to quell civil disorder, relying primarily on state and local governments to deal with these conditions. America has adequate peaceful and lawful means for achieving even fundamental social change if the people wish it. We will not tolerate violence! Crime Lawlessness is crumbling the foundations of American society. Republicans believe that respect for the law is the cornerstone of a free and well-ordered society. We pledge vigorous and even-handed administration of justice and enforcement of the law. We must reestablish the principle that men are accountable for what they do, that criminals are responsible for their crimes, that while the youth's environment may help to explain the man's crime, it does not excuse that crime. We call on public officials at the federal, state and local levels to enforce our laws with firmness and fairness. We recognize that respect for law and order flows naturally from a just society; while demanding protection of the public peace and safety, we pledge a relentless attack on economic and social injustice in every form. The present Administration has: Ignored the danger signals of our rising crime rates until very recently and even now has proposed only narrow measures hopelessly inadequate to the need; Failed to implement most of the recommendations of the President's own Crime Commission; Opposed legislative measures that would assist law enforcement officials in bringing law-breakers to justice; Refused to sanction the use of either the court-supervised wiretapping authority to combat organized crime or the revised rules of evidence, both made available by Congress; Failed to deal effectively with threats to the nation's internal security by not prosecuting identified subversives. By contrast, Republican leadership in Congress has: Provided funds for programs administered by state and local governments to control juvenile delinquency and crime; Created a National Institute of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice to conduct crime research and facilitate the expansion of police training programs; Secured enactment of laws enabling law enforcement officials to obtain and use evidence needed to prosecute criminals, while at the same time protecting the rights and privacy of all citizens; Secured new laws aimed at ""loan-sharking,"" the intimidation of witnesses, and obstruction of investigations; Established disability as well as survivorship benefits for local police officers wounded or killed in pursuit of federal lawbreakers. For the future, we pledge an all-out, federal-state-local crusade against crime, including: Leadership by an Attorney General who will restore stature and respect to that office; Continued support of legislation to strengthen state and local law enforcement and preserve the primacy of state responsibility in this area; Full support of the F.B.I. and all law enforcement agencies of the federal government; Improved federal cooperation with state and local law enforcement agencies; Better coordination of the federal law enforcement, crime control, and criminal justice systems; A vigorous nation-wide drive against trafficking in narcotics and dangerous drugs, including special emphasis on the first steps toward addiction - the use of marijuana and such drugs as LSD; Total commitment to a federal program to deter, apprehend, prosecute, convict and punish the overlords of organized crime in America, including full implementation of the Congressional mandate that court-supervised wiretapping and electronic surveillance tools be used against the mobsters and racketeers; Increased public protection against racketeer infiltration into legitimate business; Increased research into the causes and prevention of crime, juvenile delinquency, and drug addiction; Creation of a Federal Corrections Service to consolidate the fragmented and overlapping federal efforts and to assist state and local corrections systems; A new approach to the problem of chronic offenders, including adequate staffing of the corrections system and improvement of rehabilitative techniques; Modernization of the federal judicial system to promote swift, sure justice; Enactment of legislation to control indiscriminate availability of firearms, safeguarding the right of responsible citizens to collect, own and use firearms for legitimate purposes, retaining primary responsibility at the state level, with such federal laws as necessary to better enable the states to meet their responsibilities. Youth More than any other nation, America reflects the strength and creative energy of youth. In every productive enterprise, the vigor, imagination and skills of our young people have contributed immeasurably to progress. Our youth today are endowed with greater knowledge and maturity than any such generation of the past. Their political restlessness reflects their urgent hope to achieve a meaningful participation in public affairs commensurate with their contributions as responsible citizens. In recognition of the abilities of these younger citizens, their desire to participate, and their service in the nation's defense, we believe that lower age groups should be accorded the right to vote. We believe that states which have not yet acted should reevaluate their positions with respect to 18-year-old voting, and that each such state should decide this matter for itself. We urge the states to act now. For greater equity we will further revise Selective Service policies and reduce the number of years during which a young man can be considered for the draft, thereby providing some certainty to those liable for military service. When military manpower needs can be appreciably reduced, we will place the Selective Service System on standby and substitute a voluntary force obtained through adequate pay and career incentives. We encourage responsible young men and women to join actively in the political process to help shape the future of the nation. We invite them to join our Republican effort to assure the new direction and the new leadership which this nation so urgently needs and rightfully expects. Education The birthplace of American opportunity has been in the classrooms of our schools and colleges. From early childhood through the college years, American schools must offer programs of education sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all Americans - the advantaged, the average, the disadvantaged and the handicapped alike. To help our educators meet this need we will establish a National Commission to Study the Quality and Relevance of American Education. To treat the special problems of children from impoverished families, we advocate expanded, better programs for pre-school children. We will encourage state, local or private programs of teacher training. The development and increased use of better teaching methods and modern instruction techniques such as educational television and voluntary bilingual education will continue to have our support. To help assure excellence and equality of educational opportunity we will urge the states to present plans for federal assistance which would include state distribution of such aid to non-public school children and include non-public sector representatives in the planning process. Where state conditions prevent use of funds for non-public school children, a public agency should be designated to administer federal funds. Greater vocational education in high school and post-high school years is required for a new technological and service-oriented economy. Young people need expansion of post-high school technical institutes to enable them to acquire satisfactory skills for meaningful employment. For youths unable to obtain such training we propose an industry youth program, coupled with a flexible approach to minimum wage laws for young entry-level workers during their training periods. The rapidly mounting enrollments and costs of colleges and universities deprive many qualified young people of the opportunity to obtain a quality college education. To help colleges and universities provide this opportunity, we favor grant and loan programs for expansion of their facilities. We will also support a flexible student aid program of grants, loans and work opportunities, provided by federal and state governments and private organizations. We continue to favor tax credits for those burdened with the costs of higher education, and also tax deductions to encourage savings for this purpose. No young American should be denied a quality education because he cannot afford it or find work to meet its costs. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT The inability of the poor to cope meaningfully with their environment is compounded by problems which blunt opportunity - inadequate income, inferior education, inadequate health care, slum housing, limited job opportunities, discrimination, and crime. Full opportunity requires a coordinated attack on the total problem through community human development programs. Federal revenue sharing would help provide the resources to develop such coordinated programs. Jobs The nation must look to an expanding free enterprise system to provide jobs. Republican policies and programs will encourage this expansion. To qualify for jobs with permanence and promise, many disadvantaged citizens need special assistance and job training. We will enact the Republican-proposed Human Investment Act, offering tax credits to employers, to encourage such training and upgrading. A complete overhaul of the nation's job programs is urgent. There are some 70 federally funded job training programs, with some cities having as many as 30 operating side by side. Some of these programs are ineffective and should be eliminated. We will simplify the federal effort and also encourage states and localities to establish single-headed manpower systems, to correlate all such federal activities and gear them to local conditions and needs. Local business advisory boards will assist in the design of such programs to fit training to employment needs. To help the unemployed find work we will also inaugurate a national Job Opportunity Data Bank to report the number, nature and location of unfilled jobs and to match the individuals with the jobs. The Poor Welfare and poverty programs will be drastically revised to liberate the poor from the debilitating dependence which erodes self-respect and discourages family unity and responsibility. We will modify the rigid welfare requirements that stifle work motivation and support locally operated children's day-care centers to free the parents to accept work. Burdensome administrative procedures will be simplified, and existing programs will be revised so that they will encourage and protect strong family units. This nation must not blink the harsh fact -- or the special demands it places upon us -- that the incidence of poverty is consistently greater among Negroes, Mexican-Americans, Indians and other minority groupings than in the population generally. An essential element of economic betterment is the opportunity for self-determination -- to develop or acquire and manage one's own business enterprise. This opportunity is bleak for most residents of impoverished areas. We endorse the concept of state and community development corporations. These will provide capital, technical assistance and insurance for the establishment and renewal of businesses in depressed urban and rural areas. We favor efforts to enable residents of such areas to become owners and managers of businesses and, through such agencies as a Domestic Development Bank, to exercise economic leadership in their communities. Additionally, we support action by states, with federal re-insurance, to help provide insurance coverage for homes and small businesses against damage and fire caused by riots. We favor maximum reliance on community leaders utilizing the regular channels of government to provide needed public services. One approach is the Republican-sponsored Community Service Corps which would augment cooperation and communication between community residents and the police. In programs for the socially and economically disadvantaged we favor participation by representatives of those to be served. The failure so to encourage creative and responsible participation from among the poor has been the greatest among the host of failures of the War on Poverty. Recent studies indicate that many Americans suffer from malnutrition despite six separate federal food distribution programs. Here again, fragmentation of federal effort hinders accomplishment. We pledge a unified federal food distribution program, as well as active cooperation with the states and innovative private enterprise, to help provide the hungry poor sufficient food for a balanced diet. A new Republican Administration will strive for fairness for all consumers, including additional information and protection programs as necessary, state and local consumer education, vigorous enforcement of the numerous protection laws already enacted, and active encouragement of the many consumer-protection initiatives and organizations of private enterprise. Health The inflation produced by the Johnson-Humphrey Administration has struck hardest in the area of health care. Hospital costs are rising 16 percent a year -- four times the national average or price increases. We pledge to encourage the broadening of private health insurance plans, many of which cover hospital care only, and to review the operation of government hospital care programs in order to encourage more patients to utilize non-hospital facilities. Expansion of the number of doctors, nurses, and supporting staff to relieve shortages and spread the availability of health care will have our support. We will foster the construction of additional hospitals and encourage regional hospital and health planning for the maximum development of facilities for medical and nursing care. We will also press for enactment of Republican-sponsored programs for financing of hospital modernization. New diagnostic methods and also preventive care to assure early detection of physical impairments, thus fostering good health and avoiding illnesses requiring hospitalization, will have our support. Additionally, we will work with states and local communities to help assure improved services to the mentally ill within a community setting and will intensify research to develop better treatment methods. We will encourage extension of private health insurance to cover mental illness. While believing no American should be denied adequate medical treatment, we will be diligent in protecting the traditional doctor-patient relationship and the integrity of the medical practitoner. We are especially concerned with the difficult circumstances of thousands of handicapped citizens who daily encounter architectural barriers which they are physically unable to surmount. We will support programs to reduce and where possible to eliminate such barriers in the construction of federal buildings. The Elderly Elderly Americans desire and deserve independence, dignity, and the opportunity for continued useful participation. We will strengthen the Social Security system and provide automatic cost of living adjustments under Social Security and the Railroad Retirement Act. An increase in earnings permitted to Social Security recipients without loss of benefits, provision for post-age 65 contributions to Social Security with deferment of benefits, and an increase in benefits to widows will also be provided. The age for universal Social Security coverage will be gradually reduced from 72 to 65 and the former 100 percent income tax deduction will be restored for medical and drug expenses for people over 65. Additionally, we will take steps to help improve and extend private pension plans. Veterans The Republican Party pledges vigorous efforts to assure jobs for returning Vietnam war veterans, as well as other assistance to enable them and their families to establish living conditions befitting their brave service. We pledge a rehabilitation allowance for paraplegics to afford them the means to live outside a hospital environment. Adequate medical and hospital care will be maintained for all veterans with service-connected disabilities and veterans in need, and timely revisions of compensation programs will be enacted for service-connected death and disability to help assure an adequate standard of living for all disabled veterans and their survivors. We will see that every veteran is accorded the right to be interred in a national cemetery as near as possible to his home, and we pledge to maintain all veterans' programs in an independent Veterans Administration. Indian Affairs The plight of American Indians and Eskimos is a national disgrace. Contradictory government policies have led to intolerable deprivation for these citizens. We dedicate ourselves to the promotion of policies responsive to their needs and desires and will seek the full participation of these people and their leaders in the formulation of such policies. Inequality of jobs, of education, of housing and of health blight their lives today. We believe the Indian and Eskimo must have an equal opportunity to participate fully in American society. Moreover, the uniqueness and beauty of these native cultures must be recognized and allowed to flourish. THE INDIVIDUAL AND GOVERNMENT In recent years an increasingly impersonal national government has tended to submerge the individual. An entrenched, burgeoning bureaucracy has increasingly usurped powers, unauthorized by Congress. Decentralization of power, as well as strict Congressional oversight of administrative and regulatory agency compliance with the letter and spirit of the law, are urgently needed to preserve personal liberty, improve efficiency, and provide a swifter response to human problems. Many states and localities are eager to revitalize their own administrative machinery, procedures, and personnel practices. Moreover, there is growing inter-state cooperation in such fields as education, elimination of air and water pollution, utilization of airports, highways and mass transportation. We pledge full federal cooperation with these efforts, including revision of the system of providing federal funds and reestablishment of the authority of state governments in coordinating and administering the federal programs. Additionally we propose the sharing of federal revenues with state governments. We are particularly determined to revise the grant-in-aid system and substitute bloc grants wherever possible. It is also important that state and local governments retain the historic right to raise funds by issuing tax-exempt securities. The strengthening of citizen influence on government requires a number of improvements in political areas. For instance, we propose to reform the electoral college system, establish a nation-wide uniform voting period for Presidential elections, and recommend that the states remove unreasonable requirements, residence and otherwise, for voting in Presidential elections. We specifically favor representation in Congress for the District of Columbia. We will work to establish a system of self-government for the District of Columbia which will take into account the interests of the private citizens thereof, and those of the federal government. We will support the efforts of the Puerto Rican people to achieve statehood when they freely request such status by a general election, and we share the hopes and aspirations of the people of the Virgin Islands who will be closely consulted on proposed gubernatorial appointments. We favor a new Election Reform Act that will apply clear, reasonable restraints to political spending and fund-raising, whether by business, labor or individuals, ensure timely publication of the financial facts in campaigns, and provide a tax deduction for small contributions. We will prevent the solicitation of federal workers for political contributions and assure comparability of federal salaries with private enterprise pay. The increasing government intrusion into the privacy of its employees and of citizens in general is intolerable. All such snooping, meddling, and pressure by the federal government on its employees and other citizens will be stopped and such employees, whether or not union members, will be provided a prompt and fair method of settling their grievances. Further, we pledge to protect federal employees in the exercise of their right freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal to form, join or assist any employee organization or to refrain from any such activities. Congress itself must be reorganized and modernized in order to function efficiently as a coequal branch of government. Democrats in control of Congress have opposed Republican efforts for Congressional reform and killed legislation embodying the recommendations of a special bipartisan committee. We will again press for enactment of this measure. W e are particularly concerned over the huge and mounting postal deficit and the evidence, recently stressed by the President's Commission on Postal Organization of costly and inefficient practices in the postal establishment. We pledge full consideration of the Commission's recommendations for improvements in the nation's postal service. We believe the Post Office Department must attract and retain the best qualified and most capable employees and offer them improved opportunities for advancement and better working conditions and incentives. We favor extension of the merit principle to postmasters and rural carriers. Public confidence in an independent judiciary is absolutely essential to the maintenance of law and order. We advocate application of the highest standards in making appointments to the courts, and we pledge a determined effort to rebuild and enhance public respect for the Supreme Court and all other courts in the United States. A HEALTHY ECONOMY The dynamism of our economy is produced by millions of individuals who have the incentive to participate in decision-making that advances themselves and society as a whole. Government can reinforce these incentives, but its over-involvement in individual decisions distorts the system and intrudes inefficiency and waste. Under the Johnson-Humphrey Administration we have had economic mismanagement of the highest order. Inflation robs our pay checks at a present rate of 4 1/2 percent per year. In the past three years the real purchasing power of the average wage and salary worker has actually declined. Crippling interest rates, some the highest in a century, prevent millions of Americans from buying homes and small businessmen, farmers and other citizens from obtaining the loans they need. Americans must work longer today than ever before to pay their taxes. New Republican leadership can and will restore fiscal integrity and sound monetary policies, encourage sustained economic vitality, and avoid such economic distortions as wage and price control. We favor strengthened Congressional control over federal expenditures by scheduled Congressional reviews of, or reasonable time limits on, unobligated appropriations. By responsibly applying federal expenditure controls to priority needs, we can in time live both within our means and up to our aspirations. Such funds as become available with the termination of the Vietnam war and upon recovery from its impact on our national defense will be applied in a balanced way to critical domestic needs and to reduce the heavy tax burden. Our objective is not an endless expansion of federal programs and expenditures financed by heavier taxation. The imperative need for tax reform and simplification will have our priority attention. We will also improve the management of the national debt, reduce its heavy interest burden, and seek amendment of the law to make reasonable price stability an explicit objective of government policy. The Executive Branch needs urgently to be made a more efficient and economical instrument of public policy. Low priority activities must be eliminated and conflicting missions and functions simplified. We pledge to establish a new Efficiency Commission to root out the unnecessary and overlapping, as well as a Presidential Office of Executive Management to assure a vigorous follow-through . A new Republican Administration will undertake an intensive program to aid small business, including economic incentives and technical assistance with increased emphasis in rural and urban poverty areas. In addition to vigorous enforcement of the antitrust statutes, we pledge a thorough analysis of the structure and operation of these laws at home and abroad in the light of changes in the economy, in order to update our antitrust policy and enable it to serve us well in the future. We are determined to eliminate and prevent improper federal competition with private enterprise. Labor Organized labor has contributed greatly to the economic strength of our country and the well-being of its members. The Republican Party vigorously endorses its key role in our national life. We support an equitable minimum wage for American workers - one providing fair wages without unduly increasing unemployment among those on the lowest rung of the economic ladder - and will improve the Fair Labor Standards Act, with its important protections for employees. The forty-hour week adopted 30 years ago needs re-examination to determine whether or not a shorter work week, without loss of wages, would produce more jobs, increase productivity and stabilize prices. We strongly believe that the protection of individual liberty is the cornerstone of sound labor policy. Today, basic rights of some workers, guaranteed by law, are inadequately guarded against abuse. We will assure these rights through vigorous enforcement of present laws, including the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum -Griffin Act, and the addition of new protections where needed. We will be vigilant to prevent any administrative agency entrusted with labor-law enforcement from defying the letter and spirit of these laws. Healthy private enterprise demands responsibility - by government, management and labor - to avoid the imposition of excessive costs or prices and to share with the consumer the benefits of increased productivity. It also demands responsibility in free collective bargaining not only by labor and management, but also by those in government concerned with these sensitive relationships. We will bar government-coerced strike settlements that cynically disregard the public interest and accelerate inflation. We will again reduce government intervention in labor-management disputes to a minimum, keep government participation in channels defined by the Congress, and prevent back-door intervention in the administration of labor laws. Repeated Administration promises to recommend legislation dealing with crippling economic strikes have never been honored. Instead, settlements forced or influenced by government and overriding the interests of the parties and the public have shattered the Administration's own wage and price guidelines and contributed to inflation. Effective methods for dealing with labor disputes involving the national interest must be developed. Permanent, long-range solutions of the problems of national emergency disputes, public employee strikes and crippling work stoppages are imperative. These solutions cannot be wisely formulated in the heat of emergency. We pledge an intensive effort to develop practical, acceptable solutions that conform fully to the public interest. Transportation Healthy economic growth demands a balanced, competitive transportation system in which each mode of transportation - train, truck, barge, bus and aircraft - is efficiently utilized. The Administration's failure to evolve a coordinated transportation policy now results in outrageous delays at major airports and in glacial progress in developing high-speed train transportation linking our major population centers. The nation's air transport system performs excellently, but under increasingly adverse conditions. Airways and airport congestion has become acute. New and additional equipment, modern facilities including the use of computers, and additional personnel must be provided without further delay. We pledge expert evaluation of these matters in developing a national air transportation system. We will make the Department of Transportation the agency Congress intended it to be - effective in promoting coordination and preserving competition among carriers. We promise equitable treatment of all modes of transportation in order to assure the public better service, greater safety, and the most modern facilities. We will also explore a trust fund approach to transportation similar to the fund developed for the Eisenhower interstate highway system and perhaps in this way speed the development of modern mass transportation systems and additional airports. RESOURCES AND SCIENCE Agriculture During seven and a half years of Democrat Administrations and Democrat Congresses the farmer has been the forgotten man in our nation's economy. The cost-price squeeze has steadily worsened, driving more than four and a half million people from the farms, many to already congested urban areas. Over eight hundred thousand individual farm units have gone out of existence. During the eight years of the Eisenhower Administration, the farm parity ratio averaged 85. Under Democratic rule the parity ratio has consistently been under 80 and averaged only 74 for all of 1967. It has now fallen to 73. Actions by the Administration, in line with its apparent cheap food policy, have held down prices received by farmers. Government payments to farmers, from taxes paid by consumers, have far from offset this loss. Inflationary policies of the Administration and its Congress have contributed greatly to increased costs of production. Using 1958 as a base year with an index of 100, prices paid by farmers in 1967 had risen to a weighted index of 117, whereas the prices they received were at a weighted index of only 104. From the 1958 index of 100, interest was up to 259, taxes 178, labor costs 146, and farm machinery 130. The cost-price squeeze has been accompanied by a dangerous increase in farm debt - up nearly $24 billion in the last seven years. In 1967 alone, net debt per farm increased $1,337 while net income per farm went down $605. While net farm equity has increased it is due mainly to inflated land values. Without adequate net income to pay off indebtedness, the farm owner has no choice but to liquidate some of his equity or go out of business. Farm tenants are even worse off since they have no comparable investment for inflation to increase in value as their indebtedness increases. The Republican Party is committed to the concept that a sound agricultural economy is imperative to the national interest. Prosperity, opportunity, abundance and efficiency in agriculture benefit every American. To promote the development of American agriculture we pledge: Farm policies and programs which will enable producers to receive fair prices in relation to the prices they must pay for other products; Sympathetic consideration of proposals to encourage farmers, especially small producers, to develop their bargaining position; Sound economic policies which will brake inflation and reduce the high interest rates; A truly two-way, export-import policy which protects American agriculture from unfair foreign competition while increasing our overseas commodity dollar sales to the rapidly expanding world population; Reorganization of the management of the Commodity Credit Corporation's inventory operations so that the Corporation will no longer compete with the marketings of farmers; Improved programs for distribution of food and milk to schools and low-income citizens; A strengthened program to export our food and farm technology in keeping with the Republican-initiated Food for Peace program; Assistance to farm cooperatives including rural electric and telephone cooperatives, consistent with prudent development of our nation's resources and rural needs; Greater emphasis on research for industrial uses of agricultural products, new markets, and new methods for cost-cutting in production and marketing techniques; Revitalization of rural America through programs emphasizing vocational training, economic incentives for industrial development, and the development of human resources; Improvement of credit programs to help finance the heavy capital needs of modern farming, recognizing the severe credit problems of young farm families seeking to enter into successful farming; A more direct voice for the American farmer in shaping his own destiny. Natural Resources In the tradition of Theodore Roosevelt, the Republican Party promises sound conservation and development of natural resources in cooperative government and private programs. An expanding population and increasing material wealth require new public concern for the quality of our environment. Our nation must pursue its activities in harmony with the environment. As we develop our natural resources we must be mindful of our priceless heritage of natural beauty. A national minerals and fuels policy is essential to maintain production needed for our nation's economy and security. Present economic incentives, including depletion allowances, to encourage the discovery and development of vital minerals and fuels must be continued. We must recognize the increasing demand for minerals and fuels by our economy, help ensure an economically stable industry, maintain a favorable balance of trade and balance of payments, and encourage research to promote the wise use of these resources. Federal laws applicable to public lands and rebated resources will be updated and a public land-use policy formulated. We will manage such lands to ensure their multiple use as economic resources and recreational areas. Additionally, we will work in cooperation with cities and states in acquiring and developing green space - convenient outdoor recreation and conservation areas. We support the creation of additional national parks, wilderness areas, monuments and outdoor recreation areas at appropriate sites, as well as their continuing improvement, to make them of maximum utility and enjoyment to the public. Improved forestry practices, including protection and improvement of watershed lands, will have our vigorous support. We will also improve water resource information, including an acceleration of river basin commission inventory studies. The reclaiming of land by irrigation and the development of flood control programs will have high priority in these studies. We will support additional multi-purpose water projects for reclamation, flood control, and recreation based on accurate cost-benefit estimates. We also support efforts to increase our total fresh water supply by further research in weather modification, and in better methods of desalinization of salt and brackish waters. The United States has dropped to sixth among the fishing nations of the world. We pledge a reversal of present policies and the adoption of a progressive national fisheries policy, which will make it possible for the first time to utilize fully the vast ocean reservoir of protein. We pledge a more energetic control of pollution, encouragement of an increase in fishery resources, and will also press for international agreements assuring multi-national conservation. We pledge a far more vigorous and systematic program to expand knowledge about the unexplored storehouses of the sea and polar regions. We must undertake a comprehensive polar plan and an oceanographic program to develop these abundant resources for the continued strength of the United States and the betterment of all mankind. Science In science and technology the nation must maintain leadership against increasingly challenging competition from abroad. Crucial to this leadership is growth in the supply of gifted, skilled scientists and engineers. Government encouragement in this critical area should be stable and related to a more rational and selective scheme of priorities. Vigorous effort must be directed toward increasing the application of science and technology, including the social sciences, to the solution of such pressing human problems as housing, transportation, education, environmental pollution, law enforcement, and job training. We support a strong program of research in the sciences, with protection for the independence and integrity of participating individuals and institutions. An increase in the number of centers of scientific creativity and excellence, geographically dispersed, and active cooperation with other nations in meaningful scientific undertakings will also have our support. We regret that the Administration's budgetary mismanagement has forced sharp reductions in the space program. The Republican Party shares the sense of urgency manifested by the scientific community concerning the exploration of outer space. We recognize that the peaceful applications of space probes in communications, health, weather, and technological advances have been beneficial to every citizen. We regard the ability to launch and deploy advanced spacecraft as a military necessity. We deplore the failure of the Johnson-Humphrey Administration to emphasize the military uses of space for America's defense. FOREIGN POLICY Our nation urgently needs a foreign policy that realistically leads toward peace. This policy can come only from resolute, new leadership - a leadership that can and will think anew and act anew - a leadership not bound by mistakes of the past. Our best hope for enduring peace lies in comprehensive international cooperation. We will consult with nations that share our purposes. We will press for their greater participation in man's common concerns and encourage regional approaches to defense, economic development and peaceful adjustment of disputes. We will seek to develop law among nations and strengthen agencies to effectuate that law and cooperatively solve common problems. We will assist the United Nations to become the keystone of such agencies, and its members will be pressed to honor all charter obligations, including specifically its financial provisions. Worldwide resort to the International Court of Justice as a final arbiter of legal disputes among nations will have our vigorous encouragement, subject to limitations imposed by the U. S. Senate in accepting the Court's jurisdiction. The world abounds with problems susceptible of cooperative solution - poverty, hunger, denial of human rights, economic development, scientific and technological backwardness. The worldwide population explosion in particular, with its attendant grave problems, looms as a menace to all mankind and will have our priority attention. In all such areas we pledge to expand and strengthen international cooperation. A more selective use of our economic strength has become imperative. We believe foreign aid is a necessary ingredient in the betterment of less developed countries. Our aid, however, must be positioned realistically in our national priorities. Only those nations which urgently require America's help and clearly evince a desire to help themselves will receive such assistance as can be diverted from our pressing needs. In providing aid, more emphasis will be given to technical assistance. We will encourage multilateral agencies so that other nations will help share the burden. The administration of all aid programs will be revised and improved to prevent waste, inefficiency and corruption. We will vigorously encourage maximum participation by private enterprise. No longer will foreign aid activities range free of our foreign policy. Nations hostile to this country will receive no assistance from the United States. We will not provide aid of any kind to countries which aid and abet the war efforts of North Vietnam. Only when Communist nations prove by actual deeds that they genuinely seek world peace and will live in harmony with the rest of the world, will we support expansion of East-West trade. We will strictly administer the Export Control Act, taking special care to deny export licenses for strategic goods. In the development and execution of the nation's foreign policy, our career Foreign Service officers play a critical role. We strongly support the Foreign Service and will strengthen it by improving its efficiency and administration and providing adequate allowances for its personnel. The principles of the 1965 Immigration Act - non-discrimination against national origins, reunification of families, and selective support for the American labor market - have our unreserved backing. We will refine this new law to make our immigration policy still more equitable and non-discriminatory. The Republican Party abhors the activities of those who have violated passport regulations contrary to the best interests of our nation and also the present policy of re-issuing passports to such violators. We pledge to tighten passport administration so as to bar such violators from passport privileges. The balance of payments crisis must be ended, and the international position of the dollar strengthened. We propose to do this, not by peremptory efforts to limit American travel abroad or by self-defeating restraints on overseas investments, but by restraint in Federal spending and realistic monetary policies, by adjusting overseas commitments, by stimulating exports, by encouraging more foreign travel to the United States and, as specific conditions require, by extending tax treatment to our own exports and imports comparable to such treatment applied by foreign countries. Ending inflation is the first step toward solving the payments crisis. It remains the policy of the Republican Party to work toward freer trade among all nations of the free world. But artificial obstacles to such trade are a serious concern. We promise hard-headed bargaining to lower the non-tariff barriers against American exports and to develop a code of fair competition, including international fair labor standards, between the United States and comparable principal trading partners. A sudden influx of imports can endanger many industries. These problems, differing in each industry, must be considered case by case. Our guideline will be fairness for both producers and workers, without foreclosing imports. Thousands of jobs have been lost to foreign producers because of discriminatory and unfair trade practices. The State Department must give closest attention to the development of agreements with exporting nations to bring about fair competition. Imports should not be permitted to capture excessive portions of the American market but should, through international agreements, be able to participate in the growth of consumption. Should such efforts fail, specific countermeasures will have to be applied until fair competition is re-established. Tax reforms will also be required to preserve the competitiveness of American goods. The basis for determining the value of imports and exports must be modified to reflect true dollar value. Not the least important aspect of this problem is the relative obsolescence of machinery in this country. An equitable tax write-off is necessary to strengthen our industrial competitiveness in the world. We also favor the broadening of governmental assistance to industries, producers and workers seriously affected by imports - assistance denied by the Johnson-Humphrey Administration's excessively stringent application of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Ties of history and geography link us closely to Latin America. Closer economic and cultural cooperation of the United States and the Latin American countries is imperative in a broad attack on the chronic problems of poverty, inadequate economic growth and consequent poor education throughout the hemisphere. We will encourage in Latin America the progress of economic integration to improve opportunity for industrialization and economic diversification. The principles of the Monroe Doctrine, affirmed at Caracas 14 years ago by all the independent nations of this hemisphere, have been discarded by Democrat Administrations. We hold that they should be reaffirmed and should guide the collective policy of the Americas. Nor have we forgotten in this context, the Cuban people who still cruelly suffer under Communist tyranny. In cooperation with other nations, we will encourage the less developed nations of Asia and Africa peacefully to improve their standards of living, working with stronger regional organizations where indicated and desired. In the tinderbox of the Middle East, we will pursue a stable peace through recognition by all nations of each other's right to assured boundaries, freedom of navigation through international waters, and independent existence free from the threat of aggression. We will seek an end to the arms race through international agreement and the stationing of peace-keeping forces of the United Nations in areas of severe tension, as we encourage peace-table talks among adversaries. Nevertheless, the Soviets persist in building an imbalance of military forces in this region The fact of a growing menace to Israel is undeniable. Her forces must be kept at a commensurate strength both for her protection and to help keep the peace of the area. The United States, therefore, will provide countervailing help to Israel, such as supersonic fighters, as necessary for these purposes. To replace the ancient rivalries of this region with new hope and opportunity we vigorously support a well-conceived plan of regional development, including the bold nuclear desalinization and irrigation proposal of former President Eisenhower. Our relations with Western Europe so critical to our own progress and security, have been needlessly and dangerously impaired. They must be restored, and NATO revitalized and strengthened. We continue to pursue the goal of a Germany reunified in freedom. The peoples of the captive nations of Eastern Europe will one day regain their freedom and independence. We will strive to speed this day by encouraging the greater political freedom actively sought by several of these nations. On occasions when a liberalization of trade in non-strategic goods with the captive nations can have this effect it will have our support. We do not intend to conduct foreign policy in such manner as to make the United States a world policeman. However, we will not condone aggression, or so-called ""wars of national liberation,"" or naively discount the continuing threats of Moscow and Peking. Nor can we fail to condemn the Soviet Union for its continuing anti-Semitic actions, its efforts to eradicate all religions, and its oppression of minorities generally. Improved relations with Communist nations can come only when they cease to endanger other states by force or threats. Under existing conditions, we cannot favor recognition of Communist China or its admission to the United Nations. We encourage international limitations of armaments, provided all major powers are proportionately restrained and trustworthy guarantees are provided against violations. VIETNAM The Administration's Vietnam policy has failed - militarily, politically, diplomatically, and with relation to our own people. We condemn the Administration's breach of faith with the American people respecting our heavy involvement in Vietnam. Every citizen bitterly recalls the Democrat campaign oratory of 1964: ""We are not about to send American boys 9-10,000 miles away from home to do what Asian boys ought to be doing for themselves."" The Administration's failure to honor its own words has led millions of Americans to question its credibility. The entire nation has been profoundly concerned by hastily extemporized, undeclared land wars which embroil massive U.S. armed forces thousands of miles from our shores. It is time to realize that not every international conflict is susceptible of solution by American ground forces. Militarily, the Administration's piecemeal commitment of men and material has wasted our massive military superiority and frittered away our options. The result has been a prolonged war of attrition. Throughout this period the Administration has been slow in training and equipping South Vietnamese units both for fighting the war and for defending their country after the war is over. Politically, the Administration has failed to recognize the entirely novel aspects of this war. The overemphasis on its old-style, conventional aspects has blinded the Administration to the fact that the issue is not control of territory but the security and loyalty of the population. The enemy's primary emphasis has been to disrupt orderly government. The Administration has paid inadequate attention to the political framework on which a successful outcome ultimately depends. Not only has the Administration failed to encourage assumption of responsibility by the Vietnamese, but their sense of responsibility has been in fact undermined by our approach to pacification. An added factor has been a lack of security for the civilian population. At home, the Administration has failed to share with the people the full implication of our challenge and of our commitments. To resolve our Vietnam dilemma, America obviously requires new leadership - one capable of thinking and acting anew, not one hostage to the many mistakes of the past. The Republican Party offers such leadership. We pledge to adopt a strategy relevant to the real problems of the war, concentrating on the security of the population, on developing a greater sense of nation-hood, and on strengthening the local forces. It will be a strategy permitting a progressive de-Americanization of the war, both military and civilian. We will see to it that our gallant American servicemen are fully supported with the highest quality equipment, and will avoid actions that unnecessarily jeopardize their lives. We will pursue a course that will enable and induce the South Vietnamese to assume increasing responsibility. The war has been conducted without a coherent program for peace. We pledge a program for peace in Vietnam - neither peace at any price nor a camouflaged surrender of legitimate United States or allied interests - but a positive program that will offer a fair and equitable settlement to all, based on the principle of self-determination, our national interests and the cause of long-range world peace. We will sincerely and vigorously pursue peace negotiations as long as they offer any reasonable prospect for a just peace We pledge to develop a clear and purposeful negotiating position. We will return to one of the cardinal principles of the last Republican Administration that American interests are best served by cooperative multilateral action with our allies rather than by unilateral U.S. action. Our pride in the nation's armed forces in Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the world is beyond expression. In all our history none have fought more bravely or more devotedly than our sons in this unwanted war in Vietnam. They deserve -- and they and their loved ones have -- our total support, our encouragement, and our prayers. NATIONAL DEFENSE Grave errors, many now irretrievable have characterized the direction of our nation's defense. A singular notion - that salvation for America lies in standing still - has pervaded the entire effort. Not retention of American superiority but parity with the Soviet Union has been made the controlling doctrine in many critical areas. We have frittered away superior military capabilities, enabling the Soviets to narrow their defense gap, in some areas to outstrip us, and to move to cancel our lead entirely by the early Seventies. In a host of areas, advanced military research and development have been inhibited and stagnated by inexpert, cost-oriented administrators imbued with a euphoric concept of Soviet designs. A strange Administration preference for such second-best weaponry as the costly Navy F111-B(TFX) has deprived our armed forces of more advanced weapons systems. Improvements in our submarines have been long delayed as the Soviets have proceeded apace with their own. Our anti-submarine warfare capabilities have been left seriously inadequate, new fighter planes held up, and new strategic weaponry left on the drawing boards. This mismanagement has dangerously weakened the ability of the United States to meet future crises with great power and decisiveness. All the world was respectful of America's decisive strategic advantage over the Soviets achieved during the Eisenhower Administration. This superiority proved its worth in the Cuban missile crisis six years ago. But now we have had an augury of things to come - a shameful, humiliating episode, the seizure of the USS Pueblo and its crew, with devastating injury to America's prestige everywhere in the world. We pledge to include the following in a comprehensive program to restore the pre-eminence of U.S. military strength: Improve our deterrent capability through an ocean strategy which extends the Polaris-Poseidon concept and accelerates submarine technology; Redirect and stimulate military strength to encourage major innovations rather than merely respond belatedly to Communist advances; Strengthen intelligence gathering and evaluation by the various military services; Use the defense dollar more effectively through simplification of the cumbersome, overcentralized administration of the Defense Department, expanded competitive bidding on defense contracts, and improved safeguards against excessive profits; Reinvigorate the nation's most important security planning organization - the National Security Council - to prevent future haphazard diplomatic and military ventures, integrate the nation's foreign and military policies and programs, and enable our nation once again to anticipate and prevent crises rather than hastily contriving counter-measures after they arise. Our merchant marine, too, has been allowed to deteriorate. Now there are grave doubts that it is capable of adequate response of emergency security needs. The United States has drifted from first place to sixth place in the world in the size of its merchant fleet. By contrast, the Russian fleet has been rapidly expanding and will attain a dominant position by 1970. Deliveries of new ships are now eight to one in Russia's favor. For reasons of security, as well as of economics, the decline of our merchant marine must be reversed. We therefore pledge a vigorous and realistic ship replacement program to meet the changing pattern of our foreign commerce. We will also expand industry-government maritime research and development, emphasizing nuclear propulsion, and simplify and revise construction and operating subsidy procedures. Finally, we pledge to assemble the nation's best diplomatic, military and scientific minds for an exhaustive reassessment of America's worldwide commitments and military preparedness. We are determined to assure our nation of the strength required in future years to deter war and to prevail should it occur.  CONCLUSION We believe that the principles and programs we have here presented will find acceptance with the American people. We believe they will command the victory. There are points of emphasis which we deem important. The accent is on freedom. Our Party historically has been the Party of freedom. We are the only barricade against those who, through excessive government power, would overwhelm and destroy man's liberty. If liberty fails, all else is dross. Beyond freedom we emphasize trust and credibility. We have pledged only what we honestly believe we can perform. In a world where broken promises become a way of life we submit that a nation progresses not on promises broken but on pledges kept. We have also accented the moral nature of the crisis which confronts us. At the core of that crisis is the life, the liberty, and the happiness of man. If life can be taken with impunity, if liberty is subtly leeched away, if the pursuit of happiness becomes empty and futile, then indeed are the moral foundations in danger. We have placed high store on our basic theme. The dogmas of the quiet past simply will not do for the restless present. The case is new. We must most urgently think anew and act anew. This is an era of rapid, indeed violent change. Clearly we must disenthrall ourselves. Only then can we save this great Republic. We rededicate ourselves to this Republic - this one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.",66688,10069,"preamble, purposes and pledges twice before, our party gave the people of america leadership at a time of crisis - leadership which won us peace in place of war, unity in place of discord, compassion in place of bitterness. a century ago, abraham lincoln gave that leadership. from it came one nation, consecrated to liberty and justice for all. fifteen years ago, dwight d. eisenhower gave that leadership. it brought the end of a war, eight years of peace, enhanced respect in the world, orderly progress at home, and trust of our people in their leaders and in themselves. today, we are in turmoil. tens of thousands of young men have died or been wounded in vietnam. many young people are losing faith in our society. our inner cities have become centers of despair. millions of americans are caught in the cycle of poverty - poor education, unemployment or serious under-employment, and the inability to afford decent housing. inflation has eroded confidence in the dollar at home and abroad. it has severely cut into the incomes of all families, the jobless, the farmers, the retired and those living on fixed incomes and pensions. today's americans are uncertain about the future, and frustrated about the recent past. america urgently needs new leadership - leadership courageous and understanding - leadership that will recapture control of events, mastering them rather than permitting them to master us, thus restoring our confidence in ourselves and in our future. our need is new leadership which will develop imaginative new approaches assuring full opportunity to all our citizens - leadership which will face and resolve the basic problems of our country. our convention in can spark a ""republican resurgence"" under men and women willing to face the realities of the world in which we live. we must urgently dedicate our efforts toward restoration of peace both at home and abroad. we must bring about a national commitment to rebuild our urban and rural slum areas. we must enable family farm enterprise to participate fully in the nation's prosperity. we must bring about quality education for all. we must assure every individual an opportunity for satisfying and rewarding employment. we must attack the root causes of poverty and eradicate racism, hatred and violence. we must give all citizens the opportunity to influence and shape the events of our time. we must give increasing attention to the views of the young and recognize their key role in our present as well as the future. we must mobilize the resources, talents and energy of public and private sectors to reach these goals, utilizing the unique strength and initiative of state and local governments. we must reestablish fiscal responsibility and put an end to increases in the cost of living. we must reaffirm our commitment to lincoln's challenge of one hundred six years ago. to congress he wrote: "" the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. the occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion. as our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. we must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country."" in this, our stormy present, let us rededicate ourselves to lincoln's thesis. let the people know our commitment to provide the dynamic leadership which they rightly expect of this party -- the party not of empty promises, but of performance -- the party not of wastefulness, but of responsibility -- the party not of war, but the party whose administrations have been characterized by peace -- the republican party. to these ends, we solemnly pledge to every american that we shall think anew and act anew. domestic policy a peaceful, reunified america, with opportunity and orderly progress for all -- these are our overriding domestic goals. clearly we must think anew about the relationship of man and his government, of man and his fellow-man. we must act anew to enlarge the opportunity and autonomy of the individual and the range of his choice. republican leadership welcomes challenge. we eagerly anticipate new achievement. a new, vital partnership of government at all levels will be a prime republican objective. we will broaden the base of decision-making. we will create a new mix of private responsibility and public participation in the solution of social problems. there is so much which urgently needs to be done. in many areas poverty and its attendant ills afflict large numbers of americans. distrust and fear plague us all. our inner cities teem with poor, crowded in slums. many rural areas are run down and barren of challenge or opportunity. minorities among us -- particularly the black community, the mexican-american, the american indian -- suffer disproportionately. americans critically need -- and are eager for -- new and dynamic leadership. we offer that leadership -- a leadership to eradicate bitterness and discrimination -- responsible, compassionate leadership that will keep its word -- leadership every citizen can count on to move this nation forward again, confident, reunited, and sure of purpose. crisis of the cities for today and tomorrow, there must be -- and we pledge -- a vigorous effort nation-wide, to transform the blighted areas of cities into centers of opportunity and progress, culture and talent. for tomorrow, new cities must be developed -- and smaller cities with room to grow, expanded to house and serve another million americans by the turn of the century. the need is critical. millions of our people are suffering cruelly from expanding metropolitan blight -- congestion, crime, polluted air and water, poor housing, inadequate educational, economic and recreational opportunities. this continuing decay of urban centers -- the deepening misery and limited opportunity of citizens living there -- is intolerable in america. we promise effective, sustainable action enlisting new energies by the private sector and by governments at all levels. we pledge: presidential leadership which will buttress state and local government; vigorous federal support to innovative state programs using new policy techniques such as urban development corporations to help rebuild our cities; energetic, positive leadership to enforce statutory and constitutional protections to eliminate discrimination; concern for the unique problems of citizens long disadvantaged in our total society by race, color, national origin, creed, or sex; a greater involvement of vast private enterprise resources in the improvement of urban life, induced by tax and other incentives; new technological and administrative approaches through flexible federal programs enabling and encouraging communities to solve their own problems; a complete overhaul and restructuring of the competing and overlapping jumble of federal programs to enable state and local governments to focus on priority objectives. these principles as urgently apply to rural poverty and decay. there must be a marked improvement of economic and educational opportunities to relieve widespread distress. success with urban problems in fact requires acceleration of rural development in order to stem the flow of people from the countryside to the city. air and water pollution, already acute in many areas, require vigorous state and federal action, regional planning, and maximum cooperation among neighboring cities, counties and states. we will encourage this planning and cooperation and also spur industrial participation by means of economic incentives. skyrocketing building costs and interest rates have crippled home building and threaten a housing crisis in the nation, endangering the prospect of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every family. we will vigorously implement the republican-conceived homeownership program for lower income families and also the republican-sponsored rent certificate program. economic incentives will be developed to attract private industry and capital to the low-cost housing market. by reducing interest rates through responsible fiscal and monetary policy we will lower the costs of homeownership, and new technologies and programs will be developed to stimulate low-cost methods of housing rehabilitation. local communities will be encouraged to adopt uniform, modern building codes, research in cost-cutting technology through private enterprise will be accelerated, and innovative state and local programs will be supported. we will also stimulate the investment of ""sweat equity"" by home owners. our metropolitan transportation systems - the lifelines of our cities - have become tangled webs of congestion which not only create vast citizen inconvenience, discontent and economic inefficiency, but also tend to barricade inner city people against job opportunities in suburban areas. we will encourage priority attention by private enterprise and all levels of government to sound planning and the rapid development of improved mass transportation systems. additionally, in the location of federal buildings and installations and the awarding of federal contracts, account will be taken of such factors as traffic congestion, housing, and the effect on community development. americans are acutely aware that none of these objectives can be achieved unless order through law and justice is maintained in our cities. fire and looting, causing millions of dollars of property damage, have brought great suffering to home owners and small businessmen, particularly in black communities least able to absorb catastrophic losses. the republican party strongly advocates measures to alleviate and remove the frustrations that contribute to riots. we simultaneously support decisive action to quell civil disorder, relying primarily on state and local governments to deal with these conditions. america has adequate peaceful and lawful means for achieving even fundamental social change if the people wish it. we will not tolerate violence! crime lawlessness is crumbling the foundations of american society. republicans believe that respect for the law is the cornerstone of a free and well-ordered society. we pledge vigorous and even-handed administration of justice and enforcement of the law. we must reestablish the principle that men are accountable for what they do, that criminals are responsible for their crimes, that while the youth's environment may help to explain the man's crime, it does not excuse that crime. we call on public officials at the federal, state and local levels to enforce our laws with firmness and fairness. we recognize that respect for law and order flows naturally from a just society; while demanding protection of the public peace and safety, we pledge a relentless attack on economic and social injustice in every form. the present administration has: ignored the danger signals of our rising crime rates until very recently and even now has proposed only narrow measures hopelessly inadequate to the need; failed to implement most of the recommendations of the president's own crime commission; opposed legislative measures that would assist law enforcement officials in bringing law-breakers to justice; refused to sanction the use of either the court-supervised wiretapping authority to combat organized crime or the revised rules of evidence, both made available by congress; failed to deal effectively with threats to the nation's internal security by not prosecuting identified subversives. by contrast, republican leadership in congress has: provided funds for programs administered by state and local governments to control juvenile delinquency and crime; created a national institute of law enforcement and criminal justice to conduct crime research and facilitate the expansion of police training programs; secured enactment of laws enabling law enforcement officials to obtain and use evidence needed to prosecute criminals, while at the same time protecting the rights and privacy of all citizens; secured new laws aimed at ""loan-sharking,"" the intimidation of witnesses, and obstruction of investigations; established disability as well as survivorship benefits for local police officers wounded or killed in pursuit of federal lawbreakers. for the future, we pledge an all-out, federal-state-local crusade against crime, including: leadership by an attorney general who will restore stature and respect to that office; continued support of legislation to strengthen state and local law enforcement and preserve the primacy of state responsibility in this area; full support of the f.b.i. and all law enforcement agencies of the federal government; improved federal cooperation with state and local law enforcement agencies; better coordination of the federal law enforcement, crime control, and criminal justice systems; a vigorous nation-wide drive against trafficking in narcotics and dangerous drugs, including special emphasis on the first steps toward addiction - the use of marijuana and such drugs as lsd; total commitment to a federal program to deter, apprehend, prosecute, convict and punish the overlords of organized crime in america, including full implementation of the congressional mandate that court-supervised wiretapping and electronic surveillance tools be used against the mobsters and racketeers; increased public protection against racketeer infiltration into legitimate business; increased research into the causes and prevention of crime, juvenile delinquency, and drug addiction; creation of a federal corrections service to consolidate the fragmented and overlapping federal efforts and to assist state and local corrections systems; a new approach to the problem of chronic offenders, including adequate staffing of the corrections system and improvement of rehabilitative techniques; modernization of the federal judicial system to promote swift, sure justice; enactment of legislation to control indiscriminate availability of firearms, safeguarding the right of responsible citizens to collect, own and use firearms for legitimate purposes, retaining primary responsibility at the state level, with such federal laws as necessary to better enable the states to meet their responsibilities. youth more than any other nation, america reflects the strength and creative energy of youth. in every productive enterprise, the vigor, imagination and skills of our young people have contributed immeasurably to progress. our youth today are endowed with greater knowledge and maturity than any such generation of the past. their political restlessness reflects their urgent hope to achieve a meaningful participation in public affairs commensurate with their contributions as responsible citizens. in recognition of the abilities of these younger citizens, their desire to participate, and their service in the nation's defense, we believe that lower age groups should be accorded the right to vote. we believe that states which have not yet acted should reevaluate their positions with respect to -year-old voting, and that each such state should decide this matter for itself. we urge the states to act now. for greater equity we will further revise selective service policies and reduce the number of years during which a young man can be considered for the draft, thereby providing some certainty to those liable for military service. when military manpower needs can be appreciably reduced, we will place the selective service system on standby and substitute a voluntary force obtained through adequate pay and career incentives. we encourage responsible young men and women to join actively in the political process to help shape the future of the nation. we invite them to join our republican effort to assure the new direction and the new leadership which this nation so urgently needs and rightfully expects. education the birthplace of american opportunity has been in the classrooms of our schools and colleges. from early childhood through the college years, american schools must offer programs of education sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all americans - the advantaged, the average, the disadvantaged and the handicapped alike. to help our educators meet this need we will establish a national commission to study the quality and relevance of american education. to treat the special problems of children from impoverished families, we advocate expanded, better programs for pre-school children. we will encourage state, local or private programs of teacher training. the development and increased use of better teaching methods and modern instruction techniques such as educational television and voluntary bilingual education will continue to have our support. to help assure excellence and equality of educational opportunity we will urge the states to present plans for federal assistance which would include state distribution of such aid to non-public school children and include non-public sector representatives in the planning process. where state conditions prevent use of funds for non-public school children, a public agency should be designated to administer federal funds. greater vocational education in high school and post-high school years is required for a new technological and service-oriented economy. young people need expansion of post-high school technical institutes to enable them to acquire satisfactory skills for meaningful employment. for youths unable to obtain such training we propose an industry youth program, coupled with a flexible approach to minimum wage laws for young entry-level workers during their training periods. the rapidly mounting enrollments and costs of colleges and universities deprive many qualified young people of the opportunity to obtain a quality college education. to help colleges and universities provide this opportunity, we favor grant and loan programs for expansion of their facilities. we will also support a flexible student aid program of grants, loans and work opportunities, provided by federal and state governments and private organizations. we continue to favor tax credits for those burdened with the costs of higher education, and also tax deductions to encourage savings for this purpose. no young american should be denied a quality education because he cannot afford it or find work to meet its costs. human development the inability of the poor to cope meaningfully with their environment is compounded by problems which blunt opportunity - inadequate income, inferior education, inadequate health care, slum housing, limited job opportunities, discrimination, and crime. full opportunity requires a coordinated attack on the total problem through community human development programs. federal revenue sharing would help provide the resources to develop such coordinated programs. jobs the nation must look to an expanding free enterprise system to provide jobs. republican policies and programs will encourage this expansion. to qualify for jobs with permanence and promise, many disadvantaged citizens need special assistance and job training. we will enact the republican-proposed human investment act, offering tax credits to employers, to encourage such training and upgrading. a complete overhaul of the nation's job programs is urgent. there are some federally funded job training programs, with some cities having as many as operating side by side. some of these programs are ineffective and should be eliminated. we will simplify the federal effort and also encourage states and localities to establish single-headed manpower systems, to correlate all such federal activities and gear them to local conditions and needs. local business advisory boards will assist in the design of such programs to fit training to employment needs. to help the unemployed find work we will also inaugurate a national job opportunity data bank to report the number, nature and location of unfilled jobs and to match the individuals with the jobs. the poor welfare and poverty programs will be drastically revised to liberate the poor from the debilitating dependence which erodes self-respect and discourages family unity and responsibility. we will modify the rigid welfare requirements that stifle work motivation and support locally operated children's day-care centers to free the parents to accept work. burdensome administrative procedures will be simplified, and existing programs will be revised so that they will encourage and protect strong family units. this nation must not blink the harsh fact -- or the special demands it places upon us -- that the incidence of poverty is consistently greater among negroes, mexican-americans, indians and other minority groupings than in the population generally. an essential element of economic betterment is the opportunity for self-determination -- to develop or acquire and manage one's own business enterprise. this opportunity is bleak for most residents of impoverished areas. we endorse the concept of state and community development corporations. these will provide capital, technical assistance and insurance for the establishment and renewal of businesses in depressed urban and rural areas. we favor efforts to enable residents of such areas to become owners and managers of businesses and, through such agencies as a domestic development bank, to exercise economic leadership in their communities. additionally, we support action by states, with federal re-insurance, to help provide insurance coverage for homes and small businesses against damage and fire caused by riots. we favor maximum reliance on community leaders utilizing the regular channels of government to provide needed public services. one approach is the republican-sponsored community service corps which would augment cooperation and communication between community residents and the police. in programs for the socially and economically disadvantaged we favor participation by representatives of those to be served. the failure so to encourage creative and responsible participation from among the poor has been the greatest among the host of failures of the war on poverty. recent studies indicate that many americans suffer from malnutrition despite six separate federal food distribution programs. here again, fragmentation of federal effort hinders accomplishment. we pledge a unified federal food distribution program, as well as active cooperation with the states and innovative private enterprise, to help provide the hungry poor sufficient food for a balanced diet. a new republican administration will strive for fairness for all consumers, including additional information and protection programs as necessary, state and local consumer education, vigorous enforcement of the numerous protection laws already enacted, and active encouragement of the many consumer-protection initiatives and organizations of private enterprise. health the inflation produced by the johnson-humphrey administration has struck hardest in the area of health care. hospital costs are rising percent a year -- four times the national average or price increases. we pledge to encourage the broadening of private health insurance plans, many of which cover hospital care only, and to review the operation of government hospital care programs in order to encourage more patients to utilize non-hospital facilities. expansion of the number of doctors, nurses, and supporting staff to relieve shortages and spread the availability of health care will have our support. we will foster the construction of additional hospitals and encourage regional hospital and health planning for the maximum development of facilities for medical and nursing care. we will also press for enactment of republican-sponsored programs for financing of hospital modernization. new diagnostic methods and also preventive care to assure early detection of physical impairments, thus fostering good health and avoiding illnesses requiring hospitalization, will have our support. additionally, we will work with states and local communities to help assure improved services to the mentally ill within a community setting and will intensify research to develop better treatment methods. we will encourage extension of private health insurance to cover mental illness. while believing no american should be denied adequate medical treatment, we will be diligent in protecting the traditional doctor-patient relationship and the integrity of the medical practitoner. we are especially concerned with the difficult circumstances of thousands of handicapped citizens who daily encounter architectural barriers which they are physically unable to surmount. we will support programs to reduce and where possible to eliminate such barriers in the construction of federal buildings. the elderly elderly americans desire and deserve independence, dignity, and the opportunity for continued useful participation. we will strengthen the social security system and provide automatic cost of living adjustments under social security and the railroad retirement act. an increase in earnings permitted to social security recipients without loss of benefits, provision for post-age contributions to social security with deferment of benefits, and an increase in benefits to widows will also be provided. the age for universal social security coverage will be gradually reduced from to and the former percent income tax deduction will be restored for medical and drug expenses for people over . additionally, we will take steps to help improve and extend private pension plans. veterans the republican party pledges vigorous efforts to assure jobs for returning vietnam war veterans, as well as other assistance to enable them and their families to establish living conditions befitting their brave service. we pledge a rehabilitation allowance for paraplegics to afford them the means to live outside a hospital environment. adequate medical and hospital care will be maintained for all veterans with service-connected disabilities and veterans in need, and timely revisions of compensation programs will be enacted for service-connected death and disability to help assure an adequate standard of living for all disabled veterans and their survivors. we will see that every veteran is accorded the right to be interred in a national cemetery as near as possible to his home, and we pledge to maintain all veterans' programs in an independent veterans administration. indian affairs the plight of american indians and eskimos is a national disgrace. contradictory government policies have led to intolerable deprivation for these citizens. we dedicate ourselves to the promotion of policies responsive to their needs and desires and will seek the full participation of these people and their leaders in the formulation of such policies. inequality of jobs, of education, of housing and of health blight their lives today. we believe the indian and eskimo must have an equal opportunity to participate fully in american society. moreover, the uniqueness and beauty of these native cultures must be recognized and allowed to flourish. the individual and government in recent years an increasingly impersonal national government has tended to submerge the individual. an entrenched, burgeoning bureaucracy has increasingly usurped powers, unauthorized by congress. decentralization of power, as well as strict congressional oversight of administrative and regulatory agency compliance with the letter and spirit of the law, are urgently needed to preserve personal liberty, improve efficiency, and provide a swifter response to human problems. many states and localities are eager to revitalize their own administrative machinery, procedures, and personnel practices. moreover, there is growing inter-state cooperation in such fields as education, elimination of air and water pollution, utilization of airports, highways and mass transportation. we pledge full federal cooperation with these efforts, including revision of the system of providing federal funds and reestablishment of the authority of state governments in coordinating and administering the federal programs. additionally we propose the sharing of federal revenues with state governments. we are particularly determined to revise the grant-in-aid system and substitute bloc grants wherever possible. it is also important that state and local governments retain the historic right to raise funds by issuing tax-exempt securities. the strengthening of citizen influence on government requires a number of improvements in political areas. for instance, we propose to reform the electoral college system, establish a nation-wide uniform voting period for presidential elections, and recommend that the states remove unreasonable requirements, residence and otherwise, for voting in presidential elections. we specifically favor representation in congress for the district of columbia. we will work to establish a system of self-government for the district of columbia which will take into account the interests of the private citizens thereof, and those of the federal government. we will support the efforts of the puerto rican people to achieve statehood when they freely request such status by a general election, and we share the hopes and aspirations of the people of the virgin islands who will be closely consulted on proposed gubernatorial appointments. we favor a new election reform act that will apply clear, reasonable restraints to political spending and fund-raising, whether by business, labor or individuals, ensure timely publication of the financial facts in campaigns, and provide a tax deduction for small contributions. we will prevent the solicitation of federal workers for political contributions and assure comparability of federal salaries with private enterprise pay. the increasing government intrusion into the privacy of its employees and of citizens in general is intolerable. all such snooping, meddling, and pressure by the federal government on its employees and other citizens will be stopped and such employees, whether or not union members, will be provided a prompt and fair method of settling their grievances. further, we pledge to protect federal employees in the exercise of their right freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal to form, join or assist any employee organization or to refrain from any such activities. congress itself must be reorganized and modernized in order to function efficiently as a coequal branch of government. democrats in control of congress have opposed republican efforts for congressional reform and killed legislation embodying the recommendations of a special bipartisan committee. we will again press for enactment of this measure. w e are particularly concerned over the huge and mounting postal deficit and the evidence, recently stressed by the president's commission on postal organization of costly and inefficient practices in the postal establishment. we pledge full consideration of the commission's recommendations for improvements in the nation's postal service. we believe the post office department must attract and retain the best qualified and most capable employees and offer them improved opportunities for advancement and better working conditions and incentives. we favor extension of the merit principle to postmasters and rural carriers. public confidence in an independent judiciary is absolutely essential to the maintenance of law and order. we advocate application of the highest standards in making appointments to the courts, and we pledge a determined effort to rebuild and enhance public respect for the supreme court and all other courts in the united states. a healthy economy the dynamism of our economy is produced by millions of individuals who have the incentive to participate in decision-making that advances themselves and society as a whole. government can reinforce these incentives, but its over-involvement in individual decisions distorts the system and intrudes inefficiency and waste. under the johnson-humphrey administration we have had economic mismanagement of the highest order. inflation robs our pay checks at a present rate of / percent per year. in the past three years the real purchasing power of the average wage and salary worker has actually declined. crippling interest rates, some the highest in a century, prevent millions of americans from buying homes and small businessmen, farmers and other citizens from obtaining the loans they need. americans must work longer today than ever before to pay their taxes. new republican leadership can and will restore fiscal integrity and sound monetary policies, encourage sustained economic vitality, and avoid such economic distortions as wage and price control. we favor strengthened congressional control over federal expenditures by scheduled congressional reviews of, or reasonable time limits on, unobligated appropriations. by responsibly applying federal expenditure controls to priority needs, we can in time live both within our means and up to our aspirations. such funds as become available with the termination of the vietnam war and upon recovery from its impact on our national defense will be applied in a balanced way to critical domestic needs and to reduce the heavy tax burden. our objective is not an endless expansion of federal programs and expenditures financed by heavier taxation. the imperative need for tax reform and simplification will have our priority attention. we will also improve the management of the national debt, reduce its heavy interest burden, and seek amendment of the law to make reasonable price stability an explicit objective of government policy. the executive branch needs urgently to be made a more efficient and economical instrument of public policy. low priority activities must be eliminated and conflicting missions and functions simplified. we pledge to establish a new efficiency commission to root out the unnecessary and overlapping, as well as a presidential office of executive management to assure a vigorous follow-through . a new republican administration will undertake an intensive program to aid small business, including economic incentives and technical assistance with increased emphasis in rural and urban poverty areas. in addition to vigorous enforcement of the antitrust statutes, we pledge a thorough analysis of the structure and operation of these laws at home and abroad in the light of changes in the economy, in order to update our antitrust policy and enable it to serve us well in the future. we are determined to eliminate and prevent improper federal competition with private enterprise. labor organized labor has contributed greatly to the economic strength of our country and the well-being of its members. the republican party vigorously endorses its key role in our national life. we support an equitable minimum wage for american workers - one providing fair wages without unduly increasing unemployment among those on the lowest rung of the economic ladder - and will improve the fair labor standards act, with its important protections for employees. the forty-hour week adopted years ago needs re-examination to determine whether or not a shorter work week, without loss of wages, would produce more jobs, increase productivity and stabilize prices. we strongly believe that the protection of individual liberty is the cornerstone of sound labor policy. today, basic rights of some workers, guaranteed by law, are inadequately guarded against abuse. we will assure these rights through vigorous enforcement of present laws, including the taft-hartley act and the landrum -griffin act, and the addition of new protections where needed. we will be vigilant to prevent any administrative agency entrusted with labor-law enforcement from defying the letter and spirit of these laws. healthy private enterprise demands responsibility - by government, management and labor - to avoid the imposition of excessive costs or prices and to share with the consumer the benefits of increased productivity. it also demands responsibility in free collective bargaining not only by labor and management, but also by those in government concerned with these sensitive relationships. we will bar government-coerced strike settlements that cynically disregard the public interest and accelerate inflation. we will again reduce government intervention in labor-management disputes to a minimum, keep government participation in channels defined by the congress, and prevent back-door intervention in the administration of labor laws. repeated administration promises to recommend legislation dealing with crippling economic strikes have never been honored. instead, settlements forced or influenced by government and overriding the interests of the parties and the public have shattered the administration's own wage and price guidelines and contributed to inflation. effective methods for dealing with labor disputes involving the national interest must be developed. permanent, long-range solutions of the problems of national emergency disputes, public employee strikes and crippling work stoppages are imperative. these solutions cannot be wisely formulated in the heat of emergency. we pledge an intensive effort to develop practical, acceptable solutions that conform fully to the public interest. transportation healthy economic growth demands a balanced, competitive transportation system in which each mode of transportation - train, truck, barge, bus and aircraft - is efficiently utilized. the administration's failure to evolve a coordinated transportation policy now results in outrageous delays at major airports and in glacial progress in developing high-speed train transportation linking our major population centers. the nation's air transport system performs excellently, but under increasingly adverse conditions. airways and airport congestion has become acute. new and additional equipment, modern facilities including the use of computers, and additional personnel must be provided without further delay. we pledge expert evaluation of these matters in developing a national air transportation system. we will make the department of transportation the agency congress intended it to be - effective in promoting coordination and preserving competition among carriers. we promise equitable treatment of all modes of transportation in order to assure the public better service, greater safety, and the most modern facilities. we will also explore a trust fund approach to transportation similar to the fund developed for the eisenhower interstate highway system and perhaps in this way speed the development of modern mass transportation systems and additional airports. resources and science agriculture during seven and a half years of democrat administrations and democrat congresses the farmer has been the forgotten man in our nation's economy. the cost-price squeeze has steadily worsened, driving more than four and a half million people from the farms, many to already congested urban areas. over eight hundred thousand individual farm units have gone out of existence. during the eight years of the eisenhower administration, the farm parity ratio averaged . under democratic rule the parity ratio has consistently been under and averaged only for all of . it has now fallen to . actions by the administration, in line with its apparent cheap food policy, have held down prices received by farmers. government payments to farmers, from taxes paid by consumers, have far from offset this loss. inflationary policies of the administration and its congress have contributed greatly to increased costs of production. using as a base year with an index of , prices paid by farmers in had risen to a weighted index of , whereas the prices they received were at a weighted index of only . from the index of , interest was up to , taxes , labor costs , and farm machinery . the cost-price squeeze has been accompanied by a dangerous increase in farm debt - up nearly $ billion in the last seven years. in alone, net debt per farm increased $, while net income per farm went down $. while net farm equity has increased it is due mainly to inflated land values. without adequate net income to pay off indebtedness, the farm owner has no choice but to liquidate some of his equity or go out of business. farm tenants are even worse off since they have no comparable investment for inflation to increase in value as their indebtedness increases. the republican party is committed to the concept that a sound agricultural economy is imperative to the national interest. prosperity, opportunity, abundance and efficiency in agriculture benefit every american. to promote the development of american agriculture we pledge: farm policies and programs which will enable producers to receive fair prices in relation to the prices they must pay for other products; sympathetic consideration of proposals to encourage farmers, especially small producers, to develop their bargaining position; sound economic policies which will brake inflation and reduce the high interest rates; a truly two-way, export-import policy which protects american agriculture from unfair foreign competition while increasing our overseas commodity dollar sales to the rapidly expanding world population; reorganization of the management of the commodity credit corporation's inventory operations so that the corporation will no longer compete with the marketings of farmers; improved programs for distribution of food and milk to schools and low-income citizens; a strengthened program to export our food and farm technology in keeping with the republican-initiated food for peace program; assistance to farm cooperatives including rural electric and telephone cooperatives, consistent with prudent development of our nation's resources and rural needs; greater emphasis on research for industrial uses of agricultural products, new markets, and new methods for cost-cutting in production and marketing techniques; revitalization of rural america through programs emphasizing vocational training, economic incentives for industrial development, and the development of human resources; improvement of credit programs to help finance the heavy capital needs of modern farming, recognizing the severe credit problems of young farm families seeking to enter into successful farming; a more direct voice for the american farmer in shaping his own destiny. natural resources in the tradition of theodore roosevelt, the republican party promises sound conservation and development of natural resources in cooperative government and private programs. an expanding population and increasing material wealth require new public concern for the quality of our environment. our nation must pursue its activities in harmony with the environment. as we develop our natural resources we must be mindful of our priceless heritage of natural beauty. a national minerals and fuels policy is essential to maintain production needed for our nation's economy and security. present economic incentives, including depletion allowances, to encourage the discovery and development of vital minerals and fuels must be continued. we must recognize the increasing demand for minerals and fuels by our economy, help ensure an economically stable industry, maintain a favorable balance of trade and balance of payments, and encourage research to promote the wise use of these resources. federal laws applicable to public lands and rebated resources will be updated and a public land-use policy formulated. we will manage such lands to ensure their multiple use as economic resources and recreational areas. additionally, we will work in cooperation with cities and states in acquiring and developing green space - convenient outdoor recreation and conservation areas. we support the creation of additional national parks, wilderness areas, monuments and outdoor recreation areas at appropriate sites, as well as their continuing improvement, to make them of maximum utility and enjoyment to the public. improved forestry practices, including protection and improvement of watershed lands, will have our vigorous support. we will also improve water resource information, including an acceleration of river basin commission inventory studies. the reclaiming of land by irrigation and the development of flood control programs will have high priority in these studies. we will support additional multi-purpose water projects for reclamation, flood control, and recreation based on accurate cost-benefit estimates. we also support efforts to increase our total fresh water supply by further research in weather modification, and in better methods of desalinization of salt and brackish waters. the united states has dropped to sixth among the fishing nations of the world. we pledge a reversal of present policies and the adoption of a progressive national fisheries policy, which will make it possible for the first time to utilize fully the vast ocean reservoir of protein. we pledge a more energetic control of pollution, encouragement of an increase in fishery resources, and will also press for international agreements assuring multi-national conservation. we pledge a far more vigorous and systematic program to expand knowledge about the unexplored storehouses of the sea and polar regions. we must undertake a comprehensive polar plan and an oceanographic program to develop these abundant resources for the continued strength of the united states and the betterment of all mankind. science in science and technology the nation must maintain leadership against increasingly challenging competition from abroad. crucial to this leadership is growth in the supply of gifted, skilled scientists and engineers. government encouragement in this critical area should be stable and related to a more rational and selective scheme of priorities. vigorous effort must be directed toward increasing the application of science and technology, including the social sciences, to the solution of such pressing human problems as housing, transportation, education, environmental pollution, law enforcement, and job training. we support a strong program of research in the sciences, with protection for the independence and integrity of participating individuals and institutions. an increase in the number of centers of scientific creativity and excellence, geographically dispersed, and active cooperation with other nations in meaningful scientific undertakings will also have our support. we regret that the administration's budgetary mismanagement has forced sharp reductions in the space program. the republican party shares the sense of urgency manifested by the scientific community concerning the exploration of outer space. we recognize that the peaceful applications of space probes in communications, health, weather, and technological advances have been beneficial to every citizen. we regard the ability to launch and deploy advanced spacecraft as a military necessity. we deplore the failure of the johnson-humphrey administration to emphasize the military uses of space for america's defense. foreign policy our nation urgently needs a foreign policy that realistically leads toward peace. this policy can come only from resolute, new leadership - a leadership that can and will think anew and act anew - a leadership not bound by mistakes of the past. our best hope for enduring peace lies in comprehensive international cooperation. we will consult with nations that share our purposes. we will press for their greater participation in man's common concerns and encourage regional approaches to defense, economic development and peaceful adjustment of disputes. we will seek to develop law among nations and strengthen agencies to effectuate that law and cooperatively solve common problems. we will assist the united nations to become the keystone of such agencies, and its members will be pressed to honor all charter obligations, including specifically its financial provisions. worldwide resort to the international court of justice as a final arbiter of legal disputes among nations will have our vigorous encouragement, subject to limitations imposed by the u. s. senate in accepting the court's jurisdiction. the world abounds with problems susceptible of cooperative solution - poverty, hunger, denial of human rights, economic development, scientific and technological backwardness. the worldwide population explosion in particular, with its attendant grave problems, looms as a menace to all mankind and will have our priority attention. in all such areas we pledge to expand and strengthen international cooperation. a more selective use of our economic strength has become imperative. we believe foreign aid is a necessary ingredient in the betterment of less developed countries. our aid, however, must be positioned realistically in our national priorities. only those nations which urgently require america's help and clearly evince a desire to help themselves will receive such assistance as can be diverted from our pressing needs. in providing aid, more emphasis will be given to technical assistance. we will encourage multilateral agencies so that other nations will help share the burden. the administration of all aid programs will be revised and improved to prevent waste, inefficiency and corruption. we will vigorously encourage maximum participation by private enterprise. no longer will foreign aid activities range free of our foreign policy. nations hostile to this country will receive no assistance from the united states. we will not provide aid of any kind to countries which aid and abet the war efforts of north vietnam. only when communist nations prove by actual deeds that they genuinely seek world peace and will live in harmony with the rest of the world, will we support expansion of east-west trade. we will strictly administer the export control act, taking special care to deny export licenses for strategic goods. in the development and execution of the nation's foreign policy, our career foreign service officers play a critical role. we strongly support the foreign service and will strengthen it by improving its efficiency and administration and providing adequate allowances for its personnel. the principles of the immigration act - non-discrimination against national origins, reunification of families, and selective support for the american labor market - have our unreserved backing. we will refine this new law to make our immigration policy still more equitable and non-discriminatory. the republican party abhors the activities of those who have violated passport regulations contrary to the best interests of our nation and also the present policy of re-issuing passports to such violators. we pledge to tighten passport administration so as to bar such violators from passport privileges. the balance of payments crisis must be ended, and the international position of the dollar strengthened. we propose to do this, not by peremptory efforts to limit american travel abroad or by self-defeating restraints on overseas investments, but by restraint in federal spending and realistic monetary policies, by adjusting overseas commitments, by stimulating exports, by encouraging more foreign travel to the united states and, as specific conditions require, by extending tax treatment to our own exports and imports comparable to such treatment applied by foreign countries. ending inflation is the first step toward solving the payments crisis. it remains the policy of the republican party to work toward freer trade among all nations of the free world. but artificial obstacles to such trade are a serious concern. we promise hard-headed bargaining to lower the non-tariff barriers against american exports and to develop a code of fair competition, including international fair labor standards, between the united states and comparable principal trading partners. a sudden influx of imports can endanger many industries. these problems, differing in each industry, must be considered case by case. our guideline will be fairness for both producers and workers, without foreclosing imports. thousands of jobs have been lost to foreign producers because of discriminatory and unfair trade practices. the state department must give closest attention to the development of agreements with exporting nations to bring about fair competition. imports should not be permitted to capture excessive portions of the american market but should, through international agreements, be able to participate in the growth of consumption. should such efforts fail, specific countermeasures will have to be applied until fair competition is re-established. tax reforms will also be required to preserve the competitiveness of american goods. the basis for determining the value of imports and exports must be modified to reflect true dollar value. not the least important aspect of this problem is the relative obsolescence of machinery in this country. an equitable tax write-off is necessary to strengthen our industrial competitiveness in the world. we also favor the broadening of governmental assistance to industries, producers and workers seriously affected by imports - assistance denied by the johnson-humphrey administration's excessively stringent application of the trade expansion act of . ties of history and geography link us closely to latin america. closer economic and cultural cooperation of the united states and the latin american countries is imperative in a broad attack on the chronic problems of poverty, inadequate economic growth and consequent poor education throughout the hemisphere. we will encourage in latin america the progress of economic integration to improve opportunity for industrialization and economic diversification. the principles of the monroe doctrine, affirmed at caracas years ago by all the independent nations of this hemisphere, have been discarded by democrat administrations. we hold that they should be reaffirmed and should guide the collective policy of the americas. nor have we forgotten in this context, the cuban people who still cruelly suffer under communist tyranny. in cooperation with other nations, we will encourage the less developed nations of asia and africa peacefully to improve their standards of living, working with stronger regional organizations where indicated and desired. in the tinderbox of the middle east, we will pursue a stable peace through recognition by all nations of each other's right to assured boundaries, freedom of navigation through international waters, and independent existence free from the threat of aggression. we will seek an end to the arms race through international agreement and the stationing of peace-keeping forces of the united nations in areas of severe tension, as we encourage peace-table talks among adversaries. nevertheless, the soviets persist in building an imbalance of military forces in this region the fact of a growing menace to israel is undeniable. her forces must be kept at a commensurate strength both for her protection and to help keep the peace of the area. the united states, therefore, will provide countervailing help to israel, such as supersonic fighters, as necessary for these purposes. to replace the ancient rivalries of this region with new hope and opportunity we vigorously support a well-conceived plan of regional development, including the bold nuclear desalinization and irrigation proposal of former president eisenhower. our relations with western europe so critical to our own progress and security, have been needlessly and dangerously impaired. they must be restored, and nato revitalized and strengthened. we continue to pursue the goal of a germany reunified in freedom. the peoples of the captive nations of eastern europe will one day regain their freedom and independence. we will strive to speed this day by encouraging the greater political freedom actively sought by several of these nations. on occasions when a liberalization of trade in non-strategic goods with the captive nations can have this effect it will have our support. we do not intend to conduct foreign policy in such manner as to make the united states a world policeman. however, we will not condone aggression, or so-called ""wars of national liberation,"" or naively discount the continuing threats of moscow and peking. nor can we fail to condemn the soviet union for its continuing anti-semitic actions, its efforts to eradicate all religions, and its oppression of minorities generally. improved relations with communist nations can come only when they cease to endanger other states by force or threats. under existing conditions, we cannot favor recognition of communist china or its admission to the united nations. we encourage international limitations of armaments, provided all major powers are proportionately restrained and trustworthy guarantees are provided against violations. vietnam the administration's vietnam policy has failed - militarily, politically, diplomatically, and with relation to our own people. we condemn the administration's breach of faith with the american people respecting our heavy involvement in vietnam. every citizen bitterly recalls the democrat campaign oratory of : ""we are not about to send american boys -, miles away from home to do what asian boys ought to be doing for themselves."" the administration's failure to honor its own words has led millions of americans to question its credibility. the entire nation has been profoundly concerned by hastily extemporized, undeclared land wars which embroil massive u.s. armed forces thousands of miles from our shores. it is time to realize that not every international conflict is susceptible of solution by american ground forces. militarily, the administration's piecemeal commitment of men and material has wasted our massive military superiority and frittered away our options. the result has been a prolonged war of attrition. throughout this period the administration has been slow in training and equipping south vietnamese units both for fighting the war and for defending their country after the war is over. politically, the administration has failed to recognize the entirely novel aspects of this war. the overemphasis on its old-style, conventional aspects has blinded the administration to the fact that the issue is not control of territory but the security and loyalty of the population. the enemy's primary emphasis has been to disrupt orderly government. the administration has paid inadequate attention to the political framework on which a successful outcome ultimately depends. not only has the administration failed to encourage assumption of responsibility by the vietnamese, but their sense of responsibility has been in fact undermined by our approach to pacification. an added factor has been a lack of security for the civilian population. at home, the administration has failed to share with the people the full implication of our challenge and of our commitments. to resolve our vietnam dilemma, america obviously requires new leadership - one capable of thinking and acting anew, not one hostage to the many mistakes of the past. the republican party offers such leadership. we pledge to adopt a strategy relevant to the real problems of the war, concentrating on the security of the population, on developing a greater sense of nation-hood, and on strengthening the local forces. it will be a strategy permitting a progressive de-americanization of the war, both military and civilian. we will see to it that our gallant american servicemen are fully supported with the highest quality equipment, and will avoid actions that unnecessarily jeopardize their lives. we will pursue a course that will enable and induce the south vietnamese to assume increasing responsibility. the war has been conducted without a coherent program for peace. we pledge a program for peace in vietnam - neither peace at any price nor a camouflaged surrender of legitimate united states or allied interests - but a positive program that will offer a fair and equitable settlement to all, based on the principle of self-determination, our national interests and the cause of long-range world peace. we will sincerely and vigorously pursue peace negotiations as long as they offer any reasonable prospect for a just peace we pledge to develop a clear and purposeful negotiating position. we will return to one of the cardinal principles of the last republican administration that american interests are best served by cooperative multilateral action with our allies rather than by unilateral u.s. action. our pride in the nation's armed forces in southeast asia and elsewhere in the world is beyond expression. in all our history none have fought more bravely or more devotedly than our sons in this unwanted war in vietnam. they deserve -- and they and their loved ones have -- our total support, our encouragement, and our prayers. national defense grave errors, many now irretrievable have characterized the direction of our nation's defense. a singular notion - that salvation for america lies in standing still - has pervaded the entire effort. not retention of american superiority but parity with the soviet union has been made the controlling doctrine in many critical areas. we have frittered away superior military capabilities, enabling the soviets to narrow their defense gap, in some areas to outstrip us, and to move to cancel our lead entirely by the early seventies. in a host of areas, advanced military research and development have been inhibited and stagnated by inexpert, cost-oriented administrators imbued with a euphoric concept of soviet designs. a strange administration preference for such second-best weaponry as the costly navy f111-b(tfx) has deprived our armed forces of more advanced weapons systems. improvements in our submarines have been long delayed as the soviets have proceeded apace with their own. our anti-submarine warfare capabilities have been left seriously inadequate, new fighter planes held up, and new strategic weaponry left on the drawing boards. this mismanagement has dangerously weakened the ability of the united states to meet future crises with great power and decisiveness. all the world was respectful of america's decisive strategic advantage over the soviets achieved during the eisenhower administration. this superiority proved its worth in the cuban missile crisis six years ago. but now we have had an augury of things to come - a shameful, humiliating episode, the seizure of the uss pueblo and its crew, with devastating injury to america's prestige everywhere in the world. we pledge to include the following in a comprehensive program to restore the pre-eminence of u.s. military strength: improve our deterrent capability through an ocean strategy which extends the polaris-poseidon concept and accelerates submarine technology; redirect and stimulate military strength to encourage major innovations rather than merely respond belatedly to communist advances; strengthen intelligence gathering and evaluation by the various military services; use the defense dollar more effectively through simplification of the cumbersome, overcentralized administration of the defense department, expanded competitive bidding on defense contracts, and improved safeguards against excessive profits; reinvigorate the nation's most important security planning organization - the national security council - to prevent future haphazard diplomatic and military ventures, integrate the nation's foreign and military policies and programs, and enable our nation once again to anticipate and prevent crises rather than hastily contriving counter-measures after they arise. our merchant marine, too, has been allowed to deteriorate. now there are grave doubts that it is capable of adequate response of emergency security needs. the united states has drifted from first place to sixth place in the world in the size of its merchant fleet. by contrast, the russian fleet has been rapidly expanding and will attain a dominant position by . deliveries of new ships are now eight to one in russia's favor. for reasons of security, as well as of economics, the decline of our merchant marine must be reversed. we therefore pledge a vigorous and realistic ship replacement program to meet the changing pattern of our foreign commerce. we will also expand industry-government maritime research and development, emphasizing nuclear propulsion, and simplify and revise construction and operating subsidy procedures. finally, we pledge to assemble the nation's best diplomatic, military and scientific minds for an exhaustive reassessment of america's worldwide commitments and military preparedness. we are determined to assure our nation of the strength required in future years to deter war and to prevail should it occur. conclusion we believe that the principles and programs we have here presented will find acceptance with the american people. we believe they will command the victory. there are points of emphasis which we deem important. the accent is on freedom. our party historically has been the party of freedom. we are the only barricade against those who, through excessive government power, would overwhelm and destroy man's liberty. if liberty fails, all else is dross. beyond freedom we emphasize trust and credibility. we have pledged only what we honestly believe we can perform. in a world where broken promises become a way of life we submit that a nation progresses not on promises broken but on pledges kept. we have also accented the moral nature of the crisis which confronts us. at the core of that crisis is the life, the liberty, and the happiness of man. if life can be taken with impunity, if liberty is subtly leeched away, if the pursuit of happiness becomes empty and futile, then indeed are the moral foundations in danger. we have placed high store on our basic theme. the dogmas of the quiet past simply will not do for the restless present. the case is new. we must most urgently think anew and act anew. this is an era of rapid, indeed violent change. clearly we must disenthrall ourselves. only then can we save this great republic. we rededicate ourselves to this republic - this one nation, under god, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.","['preamble', 'purposes', 'pledges', 'twice', 'party', 'gave', 'people', 'america',
